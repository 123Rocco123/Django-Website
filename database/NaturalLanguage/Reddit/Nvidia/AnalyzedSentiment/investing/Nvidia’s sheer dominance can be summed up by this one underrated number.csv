,"My other Nvidia post got a lot of traction, so I thought I’d continue the Nvidia party. there’s been a lot of talk comparing them to Cisco back in the .com era. I lived through .com era and it was vastly different. If you said you were an online mall, you could get $1 billion the next day. Because people understood malls and this Internet thing was going to raise all roofs. Pets.com? I know what a pet is..com makes it even better! I remember the exact street I was driving on when the one trillionth radio advertisement for Amazon came on the radio. And I was like, what a stupid name for a bookstore. Amazon has nothing to do with books. And for years and years and years, Amazon, lost money. They only existed because that.com Bubble had lifted them so far they had Cash. Lotsa cash. But they were a joke for about a decade. But the real big thing was almost none of those companies had a profit. They didn’t make any money whatsoever. None. No business. They were burning through cash with expensive offices, expensive staff, oh man, salaries for tech workers were astronomical. The companies that did have a profit, we’re making pennies. Or there profit margins were incredibly slim. There were only handfuls of companies that were catapulted by the bubble that didn’t meet this criteria. Cisco was in a similar situation to Nvidia. Cisco built the tools that would enable this tremendous new technology. but their net profit margin was like 17%. Vastly less than nvidias. Nvidia forward p/e is 54. Ciscos was 150.

Nvidia forecasts that margin will remain around the same level for its ongoing quarter. Nvidia’s gross margins appear to be the second highest in the semiconductor industry, behind only those of Arm Holdings PLC ARM which licenses chip designs but doesn’t sell its own chips directly.

INTC, reported a gross profit margin of 46% while Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, reported a 40% margin in the fourth quarter Nvidia did note that its margins for the latest quarter and the current one could represent a peak due to favorable component costs in the supply chain in the past few months. But Nvidia had “visibility” into a mid-70% gross margin for the balance of this fiscal year, which would take margins back to where they were before this latest high-water mark.

In 2000, the top 5 companies in the S&P 500 were: Microsoft (tech), General Electric (diverse), Cisco (tech), Walmart (retail), Exxon (Energy). If you compare the market cap of the top company (Microsoft - $604B) to the market cap of the 10th stock (Home Depot - $157B) it was about 4x as big.Fast forward to today. The top 5 stocks are all tech. The market cap of the top company (Apple - $3T) is 6x as big as the 10th stock (Visa - $535B).So, the argument for market risk today is not that the entire index is overvalued. The argument for market risk today is that the market heavily concentrated in a handful of companies that are all in the same sector. Granted, these companies are insanely profitable - but insane profitability usually begets competition.

To say that they’re all in the same sector is, IMHO, misleading.Amazon, Apple, meta, nvidia, TSLA don’t compete with each other in a meaningful way. They all have the label of “tech” but so what? That umbrella is enormous and diverse.You can argue about their affect on s&p, ETFs, the broad market, but it’s kind of like making manufacturing encompass autos, jetliners, toy companies, and ikea. Just because one has issues with new airplane doesn’t mean less toys will be shipped in Christmas.They’ve all carved out unique, monopolistic niches. Who is competing with Amazon in online sales? Google? Hardly. Who is competing with meta in social media? Google? Hardly.

What they’ve already done is amazing fundamentally. It’s just really hard to justify the valuation if you’re a long term investor. And other high flyers of the past that ended up being the dominant names today had similar periods so it’s difficult to completely write it off.Their P/S is at 37x which is wildly speculative. P/S is a much more useful comparison imo because revenues are much harder to massage than GAAP earnings are. Even if you annualized yesterday’s revenue numbers and applied that to the ratio P/S is still 11-13 or so. SPY P/S is about 2.7. So NVDA essentially needs to have quarters like they’ve had the last several for years on end to even justify the current price. That’s where I get held up. To think no competitor will emerge with something better or equally suitable for customers even in the next 5 years is pretty far fetched let alone that another company won’t innovate into something better flys in the face of the U.S.’ history. Innovation led to NVDA and their price now is basically assuming innovation in their sector will be limited to them.And hey, maybe they do keep growing into those wild multiples but there are dirt cheap sectors, countries with improving fundamentals and even companies with stronger growth prospects than NVDA or any of the Mag 7 I think are better places to look long term, assuming you haven’t owned NVDA like myself (outside of index holdings).

And you state that like it’s a concrete fact.About 30 something years ago I was canvassing a neighborhood trying to sell thermal windows to people. Fun times…not.And I met another guy who owned a thermal window company. And I was commiserating with him and complaining about the sketchy nature of my business. And he said something that left lasting impression on me. He said the price of anything is what you can get for it .And that disturbed me very much at the time. I was like what a shyster. But, of course, he’s absolutely right.If you buy a snickers bar in a gas station convenience store, it’s going to cost one value. If you walk across the street to a grocery store, it’s going to cost much less. If you go to a 7-Eleven around the corner, it’s going to have a different price. And those prices as different as they are for the exact same product mere feet apart, are all correct.They represent each business, their expenses, and the convenience factor of you purchasing them. If they’re priced wrong, no one will buy, the managers will see the dip, and reprice it accordingly.Gold, silver, bitcoin, and stock, have values because people will pay a certain amount for them. If no one will pay that amount, it’s not worth that if you can wrap up your dirty socks, put them online and sell them for $1000, then that’s what they’re worth. And if you’re a famous sports star , you just might be able to do that.So for you to say, they are overpriced or underpriced is a stretch. There are prices all across the stratosphere and spectrum in the stock market. Supposedly the most efficient stock market on earth. With price discovery being instant and correct. People are buying the stock at its current price. That means it IS worth that price as of right now.You are using metrics that other companies in other industries with other balance sheets use and telling nvidia they have to use that. Like a football needs to have the same markup as a candy bar in a different store in a different region—it doesn’t.While I agree in using broad metrics and tools to judge stocks, you can’t look at the entire market and demand every bank and every tech company and every manufacturer have the same P/E. It has never and will never happen.You can say that nvidia seems overpriced to you. Or outside your risk/comfort, but you’re attempting to speak as an authority on price. You’re saying it isn’t worth that. And as of today, millions of investors not only disagree but are participating AT this price.The price of anything is what someone will pay for it.

I don't know what you're trying to articulate, though, with this. Stocks are not goods, they're businesses. And unless you're just trading short term on ""number go up"" then you're paying a certain price to own that business' future cash flows, for potential appreciation in the value of the company, or both. That's what a stock is. So eventually, that price has to be justified by the fundamental performance of the business. And just because the price is X today doesn't mean it will be tomorrow or next year, etc. The value of the business is a subjective measure with a subjective time horizon - you can say NVDA is underpriced or overpriced at these levels and you're neither right nor wrong until that uncertain future happens or until your time horizon expires. When you buy a good you're buying it for utility not as an investment (generally) - it's not the same thing.Supposedly the most efficient stock market on earth. With price discovery being instant and correct. People are buying the stock at its current price. That means it IS worth that price as of right now.I mean sure, but that doesn't mean today's price is the ""right price"". Otherwise why do some stocks move 5%, 25%, 50% in a day? If price discovery was perfect there would be no chance of alpha, of finding ""value"". What if something changes and NVDA gets cut in half? Today's price wasn't the ""right price."" Alternatively, if it doubles, today's price wasn't the ""right price"" either - it was too low. It comes down to what happens in the future which we can't know and that creates a market.You are using metrics that other companies in other industries with other balance sheets use and telling nvidia they have to use that.I'm not trying to tell NVDA anything. I have no business telling NVDA a thing but I can exercise my opinion on their valuation. Price/ xyz fundamental metric (P/E, P/S, P/B, P/CF) are pretty standard relative value metrics to assess value across companies and industries. I'm not saying and never would say all companies should trade at the same valuations because markets price in different futures for different businesses and sectors, but those metrics show what's being priced into the current stock price. And when those metrics balloon like that, it literally means the company has to grow into that multiple or the price is going to fall. Sure, at that moment the market thinks it will grow into the multiple but it doesn't have to. Do you know how much growth is being priced into a stock with a 37x sales multiple? They'll have to have blowout quarters for years to come to keep people invested at those valuation levels.You also can't ignore the noise - you can't tell me with their options activity and the heavy retail and institutional swing trading in NVDA right now that everyone believes the price is fair - they want to make a quick buck on its momentum. And good for them if they can, but that's a dangerous game. We've seen this play out time and time again - this exuberance. And it rarely ends well for most companies caught up in that. Think NVDA is the exception to the rule? Great, buy it. But odds are not on your side historically.Price/Sales is a much better metric for a growth company than a fwd P/E that you yourself reference in the post. It specifically measures how much growth in revenue is currently being priced into the stock today. Again, you might say that's fair and I say it's bonkers. They'll either grow into that and thus today's price is justified or even a good value, or they won't and the price will fall or stagnate to reflect that.You can say that nvidia seems overpriced to you. Or outside your risk/comfort, but you’re attempting to speak as an authority on price. You’re saying it isn’t worth that. And as of today, millions of investors not only disagree but are participating AT this priceYes I am sharing my opinion on the price I suppose but I'm not being an authority on price - how can I be? Market history is pretty clear that very few companies ever have justified having multiples like that over time. And I'm not saying they're the worst or anything - there are plenty of unprofitable companies trading at more dizzying valuations.You’re saying it isn’t worth that. And as of today, millions of investors not only disagree but are participating AT this price.Yeah I'm 100% saying it isn't worth that. Today it is, sure, but today doesn't matter - it matters what happens in the future if you're owning the stock and not just trading it. And that's my view - it doesn't mean the price can't keep going up or I can't read the price on the screen. And it doesn't mean I'm right either. But history shows you're incredibly unlikely to see that growth realized when price and expectations get this frothy.You also can't ignore the noise - you can't tell me with their options activity and the heavy retail and institutional short term trading in NVDA right now that everyone believes the price is fair - they want to make a quick buck on its momentum, that's it. And good for them if they can, but that's a dangerous game.The price of anything is what someone will pay for it. That is a fundamental truism in capitalismyou know what else I love about capitalism? Competition. NVDA's rise right now is fueling who knows how many other companies to dethrone them and do what they do better. AOL, NetScape, Yahoo, MySpace, BlackBerry, Intel, cable TV, radio, I mean the list goes on. Disruption is always happening and betting on a single company to dominate an industry for the long run without being disrupted or disintermediated through regulation is an incredibly risky (and historically fruitless) bet. Why do the top 10 S&P companies turn over about once every decade or so (a few exceptions of course)? Others are always coming for them. And NVDA (imo) is being priced to the point the market thinks they're immune to competition or disruption.Look, I'm not trying to posit that any of my opinions are certainties or I'm right. All I'm saying is NVDA's price, even given their incredible growth rate, is insanely lofty and it's risky to buy into them at these levels. So, so, so much has to go right for this price to be justified and for you to make real money in the stock (from here).",2,0.55,0.966,NEGATIVE

A high P/S says the market is pulling forward a lot of growth into today's price so they better capture it otherwise ppl may lose confidence, sell, etc. It sets up for poor performance if those baked-in growth expectations aren't realized, and like the narrative was with NVDA entering yesterday, if you don't deliver time and time again, you'll probably get punished. If you do, you look great.Two companies can have the same revenue but massively different profitability.Yeah exactly so how do you compare them or assess relative value? Having positive earnings vs. no or lower earnings doesn't tell you much on its face. If you've got two growth companies growing at the same clip and one is reinvesting all profits into R&D and the other is just taking the profits, the latter might look like a better value but the former might have more growth potential. So then you could look at P/S and if those are way different maybe the market is underestimating the growth potential of one or vice versa - then you'd dig deeper and try to find out why. Maybe the lower P/S company just isn't getting the attention as the other and it's an opportunity. Or maybe the higher P/S is pricing in growth that doesn't make feasible sense. And if they're the same then you have to use other characteristics to compare - maybe it's operating cash flow, free cash flow, balance sheet health, subscriber/customer retention, customer concentration, market penetration, etc. etc. and so on.Revenues are the engine of growth for any company - and no, revenues, nor any other metric in a silo really tell you much about potential shareholder value. But the price you're paying for those revenues (just like the price you pay for $1 of earnings in P/E terms) sure matters in the long run. And most already know this but if you're not a long term investor then yeah valuation metrics aren't going to be what you look at. That's different story entirely.Aside on valuations - BofA Research ran a regression on ten-year S&P 500 returns. They found an r^2 of 88% between S&P P/E ratio and the next ten years of returns for the index. In other words, in the long run (10 years in this case), 88% of 10-year returns are explained ONLY by how cheap or expensive the S&P is at the start of the period. So these valuation metrics matter a lot because your entry price matters a lot IFF you are a long term investor.",2,0.547,0.748,NEGATIVE

They were burning through cash with expensive offices, expensive staff, oh man, salaries for tech workers were astronomical. The companies that did have a profit, we’re making pennies. Or there profit margins were incredibly slim. There were only handfuls of companies that were catapulted by the bubble that didn’t meet this criteria. Cisco was in a similar situation to Nvidia. Cisco built the tools that would enable this tremendous new technology. but their net profit margin was like 17%. Vastly less than nvidias. Nvidia forward p/e is 54. Ciscos was 150.

Nvidia forecasts that margin will remain around the same level for its ongoing quarter. Nvidia’s gross margins appear to be the second highest in the semiconductor industry, behind only those of Arm Holdings PLC ARM which licenses chip designs but doesn’t sell its own chips directly. Arm’s gross margins were roughly 93% in the December quarter. Nvidia’s margins stand out among those elsewhere in the chip sector. Intel Corp. INTC, reported a gross profit margin of 46% while Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, reported a 40% margin in the fourth quarter Nvidia did note that its margins for the latest quarter and the current one could represent a peak due to favorable component costs in the supply chain in the past few months. But Nvidia had “visibility” into a mid-70% gross margin for the balance of this fiscal year, which would take margins back to where they were before this latest high-water mark. In other words, even if Nvidia’s margins come down a bit from here, they’re still poised to sit above those from virtually every peer in the sector.",You’re downvoted cuz there are bulls here not wanting to hear history 😂,0,0.503,0.996,NEGATIVE
