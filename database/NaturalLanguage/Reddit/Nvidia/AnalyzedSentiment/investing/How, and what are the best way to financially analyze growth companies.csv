,"Hey folks! I have a question—how to analyze a growth company. For example. How should we approach fundamentally, with companies that are literally creating the market (Apple back in the day, AirBnB, Coinbase, Tesla)? Or, rapidly expanding the market (NVIDIA with ai chips, energy companies that are investing in nuclear power plants). — In mature companies, it’s easy for us to value invest. But, growth investing..? I tried finding some things online but no luck yet. — I am assuming that the investor really needs to know the market in which the growth is happening to truly evaluate the potential of the company. For example. If someone works in the energy industry, and understand the high energy demand of data centers, and also understands how nuclear can provide such demand—then I guess that would be it. But for an outsider, how should one go about it?","I look at 10 year average revenue growth, recent revenue growth, and then figure out how many years it’ll take me to to get to the market multiple of fcf to enterprise value based on todays price and growth trends.I confirm my analysis by looking at the returns to assets, equity, capital employed, invested capital etc over that period to make sure the company performs consistently.There are three ways to make money in stocks. Revenue growth, profit margin growth, and valuation growth. I’d recommend leaving yourself a long runway on revenue growth if you can find it.",0,0.581,NEGATIVE,0.632

Essentially, what you are doing (correct me if I’m wrong) is analyzing how well capital is being allocated to drive revenue.And in doing so, what is the result of that. How well they are financially operating and etc.Correct?",1,0.526,POSITIVE,0.993
