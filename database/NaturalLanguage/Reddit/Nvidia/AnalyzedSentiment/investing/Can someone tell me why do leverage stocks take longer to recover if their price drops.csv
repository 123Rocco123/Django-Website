,"So over the last week or so I’ve held 3x leveraged NVIDIA shares, and people have warned me about the risk of bigger losses than with regular 1x leveraged stocks. Say the share goes down 2%, therefore I’m down 6%. However, it still takes the same percentage increase to get back up, no? So how is there realistically a bigger loss, if the underlying numbers are the same? Is it just for when there’s quite a large dip? If so, could someone explain please? Thank you","The leverage is calculated from each day.A stock is worth 100$ and it drops 10%, so no it's only worth 90$.The next day it raises 10% from 90$ and is now worth 99$.These effects will get bigger with leverage.",0,0.558,NEGATIVE,1.0

Thank you","In some cases, it's more. This was observed with funds like UPRO and TQQQ, they delivered significantly greater returns an 3X during bull runs because the green days compound. Let's say there's a beautiful paradise week where the S&P goes up 1% per day for five days. 1.015 is equal to a 5.1% return for spy over the whole week. For the 3x LETF, the return is 15.9%. That's more than just taking 5.1 × 3, which would be 15.3.More extreme examples demonstrate this slippage more clearly, like periods where 3x UPRO returned 5x just because of a ton of green days.",2,0.514,NEGATIVE,1.0

Thank you","Yes, it is true that these funds can turn out to be great multi-day trades on occasion. That would be when there is a sustained multi-day momentum move. If you are smart or lucky enough to catch that move, then, yes despite the warning, the trades can be very successful. However, it should be noted that these situations are relatively unusual. That is because even a one or two day correction can destroy returns for a multi day hold.As to NVDA, that has been one of the greatest sustained momentum trades in recent memory, so if you were smart enough to trade that with a leveraged funds you are a trading genius, and I would be the last to second guess.
