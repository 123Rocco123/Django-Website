That way, if you lose your job, or the car breaks down and you break a leg you have time adjust. Assuming you don't have to worry about losing your house and others aren't depending on you, I think you can accomplish with a months worth of bill in your saving adequate credit card limits float you for a few weeks.Next, You need to learn the difference between tax qualified savings and non-tax qualified savings.Does your employer offer a 401k? If so do they offer to match anything you save? If they do, put as much into that as needed to get the full match. Because that is free money.Pre-tax 401k's and traditional IRA's allow you to save money before paying taxes on it. But you cannot withdraw the money until you are retirement age without significant penalty. There are other rules including limits to how much you can save based on your income. When you withdraw the money you will pay income taxes on the full amount of your withdrawal.So why do it? Let's say get paid $100 more than you need in each paycheck. You can defer income tax on the $100 and deposit that full amount into a pretax 401k or traditional IRA. That gives you extra money to invest.Or you can allow that $100 to be taxed and you will end up with maybe an extra $80 in the bank.You can put the money into a Roth IRA or a ""non-qualified"" investment. When you withdraw money from a non-qualified investment you have to pay capital gains tax on the money that investment earned. There are different rates for short-term and long-term capital gains.Or you can invest in another tax qualified retirement investment called a Roth IRA, which again has restrictions for how and when you can withdraw the money without penalties.The benefit is that when you withdraw the money, you don't pay any taxes on the growth, or initial investment. That can be a lot of money you do t have to pay taxes on!Roth IRA's can be withdraw early without penalty for certain things, like buying your first house, education expenses, medical emergencies and other things. The money has to be in the Roth for 5 years and you need to read up on other restrictions.As others have mentioned, typically the best investment is a low cost fund invested in the stock market.You want to do some research on risk and asset allocation. By looking at your age and goals you can put your money into different types of investments to maximum how much you earn over time.You also want to learn the math. The math really isn't too hard, especially since there are so many calculators in the internet. But you do need to learn the vocabulary (principal, interest etc) and have an understanding of how interest works, specifically compounding interest.",0,0.521,0.981,NEGATIVE

All I present is this: if the reality deviates from your expectations (such as “Bitcoin should have gone to zero 10 years ago but instead it’s still going strong after 15 years”) then instead of bashing it and double down on your prior assumptions it pays to set aside your ego and look at things with a bit more humility.Just as easily could have went to 0.Nope. If bitcoin somehow went to zero then you lose 1%. You still have 99% of your portfolio in other investments which is the whole point of this argument above.",6,0.517,1.0,NEGATIVE

I mean the fed prints money out of thin air (unlike GDP growth and economic growth backed by value generation), then dilute everyone’s purchasing power then call it inflation.Ever check on our national debt? What about debt-spiraling? Congressional budget office estimates that we’ll be paying nearly 30% of federal tax receipt on servicing the national debt alone (aka interest) in 10-15 years.The gov has only three solutions:1: responsibly manage the fiscal budget, spend less, raise taxes, and pay down the debt overtime2. Hard Default on debt3. Water down the value of USD overtime so that the debt is monetized & worth much less, at the same time we spend all the excess money printing on forever wars, social spending aka bribing constitutes and making people reliant on gov, and propping up financial assets resulting in ever increasing wealth inequality.1 is politically impossible, 2 is financially and politically impossible as it would instantly collapse the worlds entire financial system, then guess what, I’d wager that fed prints forever….Ever wonder why M2 is the single best indicator of stock market performance? I mean the correlation is so high on a log chart that you can’t even deny it. Well, we’ve got infinite fiat chasing limited assets, such as stock and real estate, so ofc the price goes up.BTC is the only money known to man with a totally supply mathematically capped at 21M. It is secured by the laws of math, physics, and energy, and can never be bent by mortal man for their own nefarious purposes.BTC is also the first and only asset whose price is entirely determined by demand in the long run (currently stock to flow ratio is already lower than gold). When a stock price goes up 10x and demand spikes, the company will and can almost always issue more shares, in so doing diluting existing shareholders. If demand for real estate goes up and price doubles then people will find more ways to build ever smaller houses, plus it costs $$$$$$ to maintain a peppery and gov is stealing your property value by property tax every year.With BTC, you can have the price 10000x and the demand 1000x, the supply will never change.Basic economics, once u get it u never look back…Infinite fiat chasing 21M coins….

Some people are just so accustomed to inflationary assets like stocks, bonds or dollars that I think they just can’t stomach the idea that technology can create absolute scarcity. Because they don’t get that, they hear “number go up” and think it can only be a scam, ignoring the fact that value is not some absolute. In fact it isn’t absolute at all, that’s why art from famous artists can go for hundreds of millions of dollars (sounds pretty number go up to me). They say it has no intrinsic value as if anything has intrinsic value. All value is subjective. A 350 dually with a diesel engine isn’t worth shit to a woman in a nursing home. To a contractor that’s a high dollar commodity. Gold isn’t worth anything if you don’t have anyone who has the money to buy it from you at a fair price or if you aren’t manufacturing electronics. Bitcoin doesn’t either if nobody buys it. If everyone trusted dollars, bitcoin would be worth however much nerds would buy it for. It wouldn’t be worth shit if nobody invested in mining rigs. It wouldn’t be worth anything if literally every currency ever hadn’t been inflated to orders of magnitude of their initial worth. You smell what I’m steppin in. Some people are mad they missed the boat, some just have cognitive dissonance and act like they know it’s baseless even though they’ve spent a cumulative 7 minutes researching the topic. Some don’t like change. Some just distrust technology as a whole. A lot of people are too dense to understand nuance. People are fickle and en masse, idiotic and dishonest with themselves, dishonest with everyone they interact with because they will never take the hit to their ego that is being candid with yourself about yourself.Again, fuck all of them. Fuck me, dude. Forget all of this shit. Study of your own volition. Seek truth no matter how painful or condemning it may be to you or to people you love. Trust your knowledge, what you can prove. Draw your own conclusions. And above all (and I swear I am not proselytizing, just a great example) remember that Jesus was murdered for preaching about love. JFK tried to fix the economy by printing US notes (as opposed to the federal reserve notes we use today, essentially the same premise as bitcoin in its reason for being created-scarcity, hard value) and denied the industrial military complex from going into Vietnam. He was literally trying to save the world and they murdered him for it. Whatever the mechanism is that makes swaths of people hate anything altruistic, you can bet that if someone were to create a sound monetary system, everyone would say it’s a scam. The mainstream media, politicians, reddit echo chambers. Well surprise surprise, someone did it. Now it’s worth 5 figures, destined (in my view) for 6 and 7 figures, and still has not been hacked, has not been slowed, has not been changed once.People and companies have been hacked. You can do that with dollars and people do. That’s typically how ransoms work. It’s block interval changes, as it is designed to do. It has been hardforked into BSV, BCH, whatever, the core chain still runs today. “It’s only for criminals.” How many criminals hide dollars from the drugs they sell on a daily basis? How many prostitutes, pimps, human traffickers, cartels, politicians, police, use cash to launder illicit funds? Fucking all of them. And don’t get me started on the energy thing because all of the fud around that is utter bullshit. I can name half a dozen ways at least our energy systems and the climate have directly benefitted from bitcoin.Don’t trust. Verify. And you know why bitcoin is worth your investment, your research, your time and money? Because it was literally designed for exactly that. Trust in a trustless system. All of it can be seen, all of it can be understood, all of it is viable, no matter how butthurt downvoters get reading this. It’s a matter of time before people realize this thing is the solution to the gaping fault in our society.One of them anyway. Will it make crooked politicians good? No. People, time, consequences, events, circumstances do that. It’s a start. It’s one fix in a sea of fuckups that is society. One day they’ll see it.
