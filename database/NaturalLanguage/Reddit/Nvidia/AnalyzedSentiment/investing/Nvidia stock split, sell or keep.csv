I bought back in between $220-$300 and watched that go to $1000, bought more at like $830 and $860 and plan to just hold.There is nothing about their business that indicates imminent risk and they are leaders in the emerging market that smart tech people have been waiting on for years (AI).

NVDA has actual earnings and delivered product after delivered product. The tech industry and particularly internet products and services are a massive sector in the economy.I'm sure a portion of the price is helped by lots of investment in AI firms that will fail but the ones that DO come out on top will end up needing every bit of that compute and a lot more. This is why you put your AI investment money in the concrete options like NVDA who builds the hardware actually being ordered, Microsoft who has an established business and owns 49% of OpenAI, Google who has a track record of delivering cutting edge technology etc. The lottery ticket moonshot companies are the ones that die off in a bubble.That's why you don't invest in crap like Rabbit that APPEARS from the outside to be a likely fraud.",2,0.545,POSITIVE,0.871

Looking forward to you guys insight!","To those of us who worked in tech (mainly the web), the dot com bubble was painfully obvious, and predestined to burst because it truly WAS empty. 99% of the companies were little more than slick hustlers posing as entrepreneurs in order to fleece greedy venture capitalists who thought they were going to make a fortune investing in a new technology they didn't remotely understand. As long the venture had ""dot com"" at the end of it, investors gave them money.A.I. is NOTHING like the dot com bubble. It's already a REAL functional technology that is making companies massively more efficient (and thus more profitable.) And we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg. This is just the start. A.I. is evolving by leaps and bounds. It's going to change the world more than the printing press, electricity, and the automobile did COMBINED. And companies like NVidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta are going to be the leaders. Other companies may also be big players... AMD, Tesla (or xAI), c2, Oracle, Adobe, Cisco, Broadcom,etc.This is not just a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity, it's possibly the biggest investment opportunity we are ever going to see in the history of the market.",2,0.54,NEGATIVE,0.999

So yes IMO the AI bubble is just as empty as the dot com bubble. But like I said, give it 10 to 20 years and we will have an AI revolution. But I'm saying until then we will see a massive 50%-80% drop of all AI stocks within a year. No way any sane person could argue that NVDA market cap should be higher than apple.

It's still allowing us to do many things 10 times faster than we could two years ago. I'm making more money now doing things in hours than I was doing things that used to take me days just a couple of years ago. And the things AI does for me are BETTER than I could do myself! And I just own a rinky dink website/marketing agency. Mega corps are going to leverage these AI systems and save billions (and unfortunately, much of it will be in salaries for labor that's no longer needed.) But that is progress.I get the whole ""splash, crest, peak, fall"" phenomenon you're describing, but that's presuming there are no more mountains left to climb. Apple built its incredible valuation by fundamentally changing the way we communicate and use computers. But there haven't been any earth-shaking tech debuts from Apple since the iPhone/iPad. All we get now are incremental improvements.Generative A.I. is just the first step in a massive A.I. evolution. Right now we're seeing the beginnings with basic content generation... it can write simple code, copy, generate images, reproduce voices, and even create short videos. Some of it is clearly artificial, but some is indistinguishable from the real thing. It's not perfect, but it soon will be. That's the next small step.Over the next 5-10 years, we're going to see generative A.I. replacing actors, musicians, artists, writers, coders, paralegals, medical diagnosticians... and the list goes on. Virtually ALL customer service will be AI-based. Any simple human job that can be replace by AI automation, will be. That's the next BIG step.Eventually, AI will replace doctors, lawyers, engineers, teachers, physicists... highly educated and specialized professions. And it still won't be TRUE AI. It will be generative AI, but the algorithms with be hundreds of times more complex, and the datasets won't be limited. AI will have access to the sum-total of ALL information on the internet (unless the government smartens up and starts to regulate the technology, which probably won't happen until it's too late.)NVDA obviously isn't going to be the king forever, but for the next 5-10 years, they (along with the other ""magnificent seven"") are going to be unstoppable. What happens after I can't say. You can call it it a ""bubble"" if you want, but it's going to make a LOT of millionaires and billionaires long before it pops.

Looking forward to you guys insight!","My research indicates any fractional shares owned will result in a prorated split. So, if there's a 10/1 split and you own 1.5 shares, you will be awarded 15 shares. You won't need to own whole shares to benefit here. As the other commenter mentioned, no one buys NVDA for dividends and if they did, they will still receive prorated dividends from fractional shares. The fact that people on reddit keep parroting the ""hold till the split"" rhetoric tells me some whales might happily cash out and take their gains. I still think it's a good long play regardless of the split, I'm just not confident it will drive the price up higher in the short-term. ",4,0.526,NEGATIVE,1.0
