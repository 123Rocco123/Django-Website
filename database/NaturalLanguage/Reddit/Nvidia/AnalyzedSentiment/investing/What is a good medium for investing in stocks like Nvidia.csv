Thank you","Word of warning - evidently you have “heard of” two things that are likely to lose you money when combined: Robinhood and NVIDIA stock. There have been a few lottery winners whose stories catch on but this is not the norm and not what should be expected consistently for everyone. You are walking naively into to the ~$300 trillion world of tradable securities where people who don’t know what they are doing make uninformed decisions and lose money every day. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t reliable ways to build wealth with stock investing. Before you start selecting a broker and picking investments, you need a financial plan and an asset allocation strategy so you don’t just drop your savings on the roulette table.

If I may ask a question, so my understanding of this was places like Amazon, and Starbucks, and Microsoft.
