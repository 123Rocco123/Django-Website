Wall Street extrapolated growth similarly with tech stocks during the pandemic and seems to have already forgotten the huge losses of 2022.Here's a lesson from the Dot Com bubble:""I noted that on January 9, 2001, nine days after the quarter ended, analysts were forecasting operating earnings of the technology sector to come in at $10 in the fourth quarter of 2000. Six weeks later, when all the profits were tallied, operating earnings for tech stocks came in at $7.69.If analysts can be off by nearly 25 percent in forecasting earnings of a quarter that has just ended, what confidence can investors have in their prediction for the coming year - or, for that matter, for the next three to five years? The truth is, very little.""Jeremy Siegel, The Future for Investors",0,0.557,NEGATIVE,0.999

AI is absolutely over hyped right now as it's real capabilities do not live up to the marketing, but it's still incredibly impressive and will continue to improve. As more and more companies invest in AI, the demand for the specific types of chips that best support AI applications will increase. Today, there is no alternative to Nvidia in that space.HOWEVER, Nvidias advantage is not absolute. A big weakness is their use of TSMC to manufacture their chips. This means that the actual manufacturing capabilities are available to all their competitors, the only thing NVidia has is their proprietary designs. Competing companies like AMD and Qualcomm only need to develop designs that are ""good enough"", have TSMC make them, and then sell those chips at a lower price point. They'll begin to eat at Nvidias market share. NVidia may remain the leader for some time, but that lead will decrease.On top of this, Nvidias stock price is absolutely insanely high. That introduces a big risk of underperformance. Basically Nvidia doesn't just have to do well, or even very well. Nvidia has to blow everyone out of the water by a mile just to meet the current expectations of the market. Just one ""good but not great"" quarter is enough to bring down the stock price at these levels.In short, the best money to make on Nvidia has already been made. It may continue to go up in the near term, but it's drop is only a matter of time. Chasing super hyped leaders in the market is the kind of gamble that looses money as much as it makes money.",0,0.555,POSITIVE,0.665

Competitors will have to write libraries to compete with CUDA, so that developers & researchers can actually use the hardware for AI and non-graphics tasks.Competitors can do this - but it would take many months or years to catch up once they start. And they haven't really started. AMD is not serious about making software that competes with CUDA. rocm is out there, but unreliable from what I hear (I haven't tried it).You don't have to know a thing about Nvidia chips to write neural networks that work on their hardware. It's baked in to tensorflow, torch, triton, & other libs behind the scenes. It works automatically, and you can focus on solving your problem, not fiddling with the hardware.AMD & other competitors will need to achieve this state in order to take meaningful market share from Nvidia.If they can do this, I welcome it.

AMD have been trying for years to develop parts that are ""good enough"" to compete with Nvidia. AMD's marketshare (in dGPU where they compete most closely) is on the decline. Qualcomm is going after a completely different segment of the market. Your statement totally overlooks/discount the entire software suite (MOAT) that Nvidia has put together to allow their chips to run at peaks that AMD and QCOM can only dream about. Nvidia builds a platform. That is the whole ball game here.Nvidia isn't for every investor, absolutely.

AI is an industry I believe in and it will lead to amazing things for sure generally speaking.It's exciting and I agree. It's in fact so hard to resist being excited that it's partly why I think it's not wise to invest at the moment.In the case of Nvidia, it's simply a situation they don't entirely control. They can produce services and products at an excellent quality, but their balance sheet and analytics doesn't reflect that their service is fully to praise for what they have experienced. I believe what is happening is due to the excitement, and people don't want to miss out.The situation is simply an example of over saturation. It will settle as time goes on, but nvidia will in no way lose due to it. But the investor can, if they don't buy rationally at the moment.The best thing to do rn is to wait.

It can be determined by many factors:the management has shown to be political, too risky, or generally incompetent.the company no longer abides or heavily changes it's founding ethos and valuesthe company's current industries and markets have no future, AND it's showing no effort to expand into othersthe company has lost its competitive advantage has gotten ""too comfortable in its position"" or does nothing to combat rising competitors.the company shows it refuses to innovatethere's another company that's far more promising to commit toIf amazon shows its slowly starting to care less about the customer, I'm not hesitating to sell. Why? Because that's what amazon is. Without customer satisfaction, amazon is gonna busy eventually. Their dominance will make it hard, but new underdogs will emerge to take their place. I will discuss an example of another company who went bankrupt by getting what I call ""a company ego"".The things above aren't always a clear reason to sell stock, those negative points need to be observed CONSISTENTLY and with proof. That can be their balance sheet, news, tension etc.A company simply being over valued, or is not profitable is not enough to reveal if its time to sell. You need to dig deeper and understand why what is happening is happening. If a company stock is dropping rapidly, it might not be due to incompetence, it might be external circumstances such as natural disasters, recessions, theft, war, etc. Those things, especially for a big company aren't necessarily deciders on a crap company bc they had no way of controlling it.Block buster is an example of a good business gone bad. They started in a promising market and industry and quickly asserted dominance within it. But they didn't innovate and didn't expand into more promising markets. The management was lazy and comfortsble with it's dominance, and just sat by while netflix eclipsed them with their far superior and more convenient service.Disney is a example of a company gone right. They are almost 100 years old I believe. They should have died out to more promising upcoming competitors like Dreamworks and pixar, but they didn't because they had good management, and utilised their best asset: it's brand. It expanded into so many industries and made smart purchases. Unlike block buster, they're not comfortable either, Disney dipped into streaming after netflix's success, capitalising on the opportunity, they opened up theme parks to bolster their other markets. They're even dabbling with AI a little showing they can innovate. This is just one example, there are so many others like Apple, who have a similar promising business.In the case of nvidia, they're brilliant. They have been around for a while, and have capitalised on the markets they operate within. They use their prestige and position in the industry to propel themselves and show they are always excited to innovate and break into new industries and markets. That's a good company. It's management has been... Questionable sometimes but still very strong. But as I said, just because they have these things doesn't mean they're ready to buy. Their balance sheet and stock analysis clearly shows they're over valued because of one reason: hype. Let the hype die down, then capitalise on the lower priced stock. If you want to sell nvidia stock, by all means, they're in a strong position to sell too. But you also have a third choice... HOLD. some people forget holding is an option, and it's a strategy as well. Holding means you're confident nvidia can for example capitalise on their current situation and will continue to show promise far into the future.",2,0.562,NEGATIVE,1.0

Their balance sheet and the current economic environment do not favour the company maintaining this for long. The AI hype is real and I love it, afterall AI will probably be considered the next industrial revolution for sure.But just because that is the case, doesn't mean nvidia St it's current price is a good price. The business alone shows that.Though not saying I'll never invest into nvidia, they're an amazing company and one I've been a fan of for years. I have owned nvidia stock in the past and used their products. They know what they're doing. But the AI hype situation is purely external and environnental,and it's a fact the company cannot control. Because it cannot control it, it cannot maintain it. Yes it can capitalise on it to produce short term success and they are doing so, seeing them rise 200% or so in a year.But ask yourself, rationally and considering the wider picture. Can nvidia control 100% of what Is happening to them right now? No. They can only produce great products and service, and breaking into cool markets with lots of potential.Once the hype settles down a little, what we will see is likely a small crash, followed by a steady but good and reliable growth trend up, as long as nvidia does what they do best... Innovate and provide robust technology that out-competes it's competition like AMD and Intel.It's simple as that.",2,0.569,NEGATIVE,0.999
