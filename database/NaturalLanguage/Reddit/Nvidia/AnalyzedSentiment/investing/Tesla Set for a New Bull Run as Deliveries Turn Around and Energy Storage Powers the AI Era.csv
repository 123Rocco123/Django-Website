,"Whenever investors are disappointed with Tesla, Elon Musk surprises short sellers with a big move. On Tuesday, Tesla posted stronger-than-expected Q2 deliveries, hinting at a turning point for weak demand, with an upside in Q3 deliveries. Additionally, energy storage deployments doubled quarter-over-quarter, potentially helping to meet the vast electricity demand that comes with AI. These factors are enough to bring in a substantial influx of Tesla bulls. Thanks to these developments, Tesla surged over 10% on Tuesday, with its market value reaching $737.5 billion, maintaining a six-day rally, and breaking another resistance level, which is always a bullish sign. From April's low, Tesla shares are now up 67%. Q2 Deliveries Slightly Exceed Expectations Amid Record June Deliveries from Chinese EV Makers, Zero-Interest Car Purchases Expected to Drive Crazy Q3 Demand According to Tesla's delivery data released on Tuesday, the company delivered 440,000 new vehicles in Q2, down 4.8% year-over-year but up 15% quarter-over-quarter, and better than the market's expectation of 439,300 vehicles. The total production in Q2 was about 411,000 cars, resulting in a delivery-production gap of 33,000 cars, compared to -46,000 cars in the previous quarter (where more cars were produced, leading to some inventory remaining). Tesla noted that sales in the second quarter were affected by the temporary shutdown of German factories and the Red Sea conflict, which also means there is upward potential on the demand side or perhaps short-term supply struggles to meet demand, which is obviously more exciting than excess supply. Considering that Chinese EV makers such as NIO, ZEEKR, and Leapmotor have all reported record deliveries in June, this implies a significant recovery in demand for Tesla. The company also launched a major campaign on Monday, introducing five-year zero interest financing for Model 3/Y and other preferential policies. Specifically, users who place an order before and including July 31 can avail themselves of a no-down-payment deal: with an initial down payment of 79,900 yuan (10,990 dollars), the daily installment for the Model 3 RWD and Long Range AWD will be as low as 85 yuan and 107 yuan respectively (12 and 15 dollars for each), while the Model Y RWD and Long Range will be as low as 95 yuan and 118 yuan per day. Users who make a down payment of 45,900 yuan (6,300 dollars) can opt for a five-year low-interest plan (starting at an annualized rate of 0.93%). The Chinese market accounts for about 22.5% of Tesla's revenue, and if this measure is implemented in other countries in the future, it would indeed be a massive move. This also adds a new narrative for Tesla's Q3 growth. Energy Storage Deployment Doubles, Benefitting from AI Era Both NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have pointed out that the future development of artificial intelligence is closely related to energy and storage. While Tesla's AI business has yet to show tangible benefits, its energy storage business is poised to become a pillar of AI in the future. Tesla reported that it deployed 9.4 GWh of energy storage products in Q2, setting a new record for quarterly deployment, more than double the 4 GWh in Q1, and the company's energy storage deployments in the first half of the year almost matched the total for last year. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas praised, ""As Gen AI acceleration spurs a multigenerational increase in energy demand, electricity generation, and data center investment, we believe investors will begin to pay more attention to Tesla Energy, which we value at $36 per Tesla share ($130bn) as the business is uniquely positioned to benefit from investment in the U.S. electric grid accelerated by the AI boom.""","Former President Donald Trump has said if he’s re-elected, he plans to zero out the EV tax credits & subsidies from 2022’s Inflation Reduction Act (which have primarily benefited one company to date: Tesla.)I think that’s a risk Tesla investors (speculators) are not pricing in right now. Tesla has benefited from massive government subsidies for almost its entire history as a public company.",0,0.562,NEGATIVE,0.551
