,"I’ve thrown some money at Broadcom, Nvidia, SMCI, VOO and QQQ thus far. I’m wondering what I should do with the remainder of money I have available. And also, if Nvidia is even worth holding on to. I bought Nvidia a month or so ago at $120 a share when there was all this investor hype. But seemingly the price projections for Nvidia are only like $140 or so for next year. Meaning that I seemingly won’t really make all that good a return on investment, as oppossed to if I just reinvested somewhere else. So should I just sell my shares of Nvidia and re-invest in something else? Or is it worth holding on to?

For instance, Nvidia is already like 6% of VOO, by buying more of it you're only making your own portfolio less diversified than VOO is.If you want to diversify you should be looking at what VOO/QQQ doesn't cover or doesn't have as much coverage in. So like, small-mid cap stocks, non-tech stocks, international, or bonds. Stuff like that.",2,0.518,NEGATIVE,1.0

You can go VTI to contain stock from the entirety of the US market if you want more diversity but returns are fairly similar between the two.

Adding QQQ and individual tech names only makes it more overweight tech, especially adding mega caps like NVDA. There is nothing wrong with that if that's what you want, but that is the opposite of diversification.One way to diversify is to add bonds to your portfolio, like in a traditional 60/40 (e.g., BIL, IEF, TLT).
