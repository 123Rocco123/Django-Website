,"Gene was giving a great analysis of Nvidia potential headwinds into the future of this AI Super Cycle. <video here> The problem is I don't think these analyst are getting how Nvidia works which is weird because they literally have direct access to Jensen. I think the word ""Data Center"" is confusing. I think they believe that data center means something that is not cloud like but rather a super computer that is shipped to someone who then uses it in the cloud. And that's it they ship the hardware and Nvidia never sees them again. That's not what is going on here. First, Nvidia can direct sell you cloud like access to all their hardware and software services all by themselves. NVIDIA DGX Cloud is a serverless, AI-training-as-a-service platform for enterprises that depend on AI. With integrated best-in-class software, direct access to NVIDIA AI experts, and near-limitless access to high-performance compute, DGX Cloud delivers industry-leading utilization efficiency with scale and productive work capacity for developers—at the lowest TCO compared with traditional infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) approaches. Dan Nathan just seems either confused or just willfully attempting to rally a short position. I lean to the latter because I can't believe he is actually believing what he is saying but I could be wrong. Maybe Dan is just confused. Second, You can then access Nvidia with all of it's software and services FROM effectively a third party such as Azure or AWS. Why would someone go this route? The reason is many times companies have contracts in place to get discounted compute from 1 or 2 cloud providers. So, they sort of go all in with Microsoft Azure as an example. The legal and contract agreements are in place for the entire IT department to use ""whatever"" is in Azure. Well, if Nvidia cloud can be accessed in Azure that's great because all of the engineers and DS's can have access without going through and getting agreements in place for Nvidia directly. There is obviously the chance of more cost but for the lack of headache it is probably negligible. But, every situation is different. Point is, that is money that is going directly to Nvidia (and probably the serving cloud provider at some portion) because at that point Microsoft or AWS or Google is only a passthrough. This is very much the same for other provider as well such as MongoDB and Redis Labs. Now, on the other side Microsoft, X and AWS have every right to purchase, store and assemble their own solutions with purchased hardware from Nvidia and others and also provide and direct sale their own option. See that's the difference of HARDWARE sales and CLOUD INCOME. I haven't heard this on the conference calls and would be great if someone talked about it because it would become so much more clear. You must understand the distinction to understand Nvidia's current business model right now. Back to Gene. So the the mistake that everyone keeps making is that they're saying the BUST or the apocalypse MUST come for nvidia because once they sale all of the hardware then nobody is going to buy anymore. Thus the ""GLUT"". That's not how this is working. You have to get your mind out of the Crypto/NFT ponzi scheme to understand this. Crypto had a bunch of GPU's going up against a supply / demand model of increasing BitCoin price. When the bitcoin price crashed. Everyone holding a warehouse of GPU's costing millions in electricity suddenly didn't want to be a bitcoin miner anymore. Hence, a bunch of GPU's that nobody wanted. The ""GLUT"". This was probably max of Bitcoin falling to ~12000. It's also why ETH and others wanted to go to ASICS and get off the Bitcoin hype cycle. Nobody talks about AWS or Azure or Google's ""GLUT"" concern with bought servers and hardware. Nobody. AWS and Azure update their cloud server options all of the time. It's a natural cycle that is smooth and calculated. Why is it not conceivable that this will be similar for Nvidia? Everyone is trying to predict the day Nvidia falls instead of trying to think ""hmm"" maybe, just maybe, Nvidia is growing as a cloud offering with software, hardware and service. Sound like IaaS? Because it is. It's the same concept as general compute but with accelerated compute. The software stack is why you would go for Nvidia as opposed to using a different cloud provider native abstraction. MongoDB in Azure Cosmos is not as good as MongoDB direct to Mongo IN Azure. Or at least that might be a consideration for you. Speaking of Data storage companies one could make an analogy here. Data gets stored and then you access said data. LLM's get trained and then you access said LLM. The only difference is that the LLM needs compute to run it. Less than training compute but still accelerated compute. The training doesn't happen one time and that's it. You could train a model and it suck and then you have to retrain it. Or you need to update it so you have to retrain it. The money it cost to train is in the million's. multiple millions of dollars for foundational LLM's. There will be no more glut here than there is in any other cloud providers for general compute. There will not be a ""BUST"" this time. So don't worry Dan, you can come out of the shorts and join the rest of us into the future.","Nvidia is going to be the most valuable company in the world soon, and most MFers online will still be screaming bubble lol",0,0.593,0.974,POSITIVE

The cloud vendors add a lot of extra governance, security, etc and have huge economies of scale. Your CosmosDB example - CosmosDB has A LOT of extra capabilities baked into the infrastructure that Microsoft have built around the service to justify the extra cost. It’s not strictly better going direct to MongoDB.

,"Gene was giving a great analysis of Nvidia potential headwinds into the future of this AI Super Cycle. <video here> The problem is I don't think these analyst are getting how Nvidia works which is weird because they literally have direct access to Jensen. I think the word ""Data Center"" is confusing. I think they believe that data center means something that is not cloud like but rather a super computer that is shipped to someone who then uses it in the cloud. And that's it they ship the hardware and Nvidia never sees them again. That's not what is going on here. First, Nvidia can direct sell you cloud like access to all their hardware and software services all by themselves. NVIDIA DGX Cloud is a serverless, AI-training-as-a-service platform for enterprises that depend on AI. With integrated best-in-class software, direct access to NVIDIA AI experts, and near-limitless access to high-performance compute, DGX Cloud delivers industry-leading utilization efficiency with scale and productive work capacity for developers—at the lowest TCO compared with traditional infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) approaches. Dan Nathan just seems either confused or just willfully attempting to rally a short position. I lean to the latter because I can't believe he is actually believing what he is saying but I could be wrong. Maybe Dan is just confused. Second, You can then access Nvidia with all of it's software and services FROM effectively a third party such as Azure or AWS. Why would someone go this route? The reason is many times companies have contracts in place to get discounted compute from 1 or 2 cloud providers. So, they sort of go all in with Microsoft Azure as an example. The legal and contract agreements are in place for the entire IT department to use ""whatever"" is in Azure. Well, if Nvidia cloud can be accessed in Azure that's great because all of the engineers and DS's can have access without going through and getting agreements in place for Nvidia directly. There is obviously the chance of more cost but for the lack of headache it is probably negligible. But, every situation is different. Point is, that is money that is going directly to Nvidia (and probably the serving cloud provider at some portion) because at that point Microsoft or AWS or Google is only a passthrough.

With integrated best-in-class software, direct access to NVIDIA AI experts, and near-limitless access to high-performance compute, DGX Cloud delivers industry-leading utilization efficiency with scale and productive work capacity for developers—at the lowest TCO compared with traditional infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) approaches.

The reason is many times companies have contracts in place to get discounted compute from 1 or 2 cloud providers. So, they sort of go all in with Microsoft Azure as an example. The legal and contract agreements are in place for the entire IT department to use ""whatever"" is in Azure. Well, if Nvidia cloud can be accessed in Azure that's great because all of the engineers and DS's can have access without going through and getting agreements in place for Nvidia directly. There is obviously the chance of more cost but for the lack of headache it is probably negligible. But, every situation is different. Point is, that is money that is going directly to Nvidia (and probably the serving cloud provider at some portion) because at that point Microsoft or AWS or Google is only a passthrough. This is very much the same for other provider as well such as MongoDB and Redis Labs. Now, on the other side Microsoft, X and AWS have every right to purchase, store and assemble their own solutions with purchased hardware from Nvidia and others and also provide and direct sale their own option.

The ramp up time in production that it would take? They’re so far ahead already that it’d take 5-10 years to catch up?I think it is all of these things. I think they just had a head start with gaming and pulled away so much from AMD that they kind of have a Moat.What's more interesting is Sam Altman and OpenAI in all of this. They took all of this special accelerated compute (GPU) and made something beautiful with it. Anything that involves math is where GPU's are an absolute necessity.However, make no mistake, there is an even better technology on the landscape and that is quantum accelerated compute. Think of a GPU handed down from god himself. It will be that prolific. Quantum compute and Fusion energy are literally god level events that will be so awesome for humanity.So while GPU's are kind of a Moat for Nvidia right now Quantum will be an entirely new ballgame in the accelerated compute sector. What year will that be? I do not know. 5 - 10 years maybe?Another thing to consider is that there doesn't need to be negativity in the scene right now. Nvidia is making everyone better all around him. He knows there is competition but I've never heard him say anything negative about anyone or anything. Maybe i'm wrong or mistaken but Jensen has been very gracious in this rise. Well wait, he did make the comment that maybe Sam want's to ""buy all the GPU's"" lol. Perhaps there's more of a bull in there somewhere.But that's to be expected right. More competion and furthering your Moat. Google surely did that with search. Apple with Iphones and so on.I always point to Open source and Linux as great stories that went up against all odds and placed a foothold into the community while still letting everyone else benefit and eat.Your thoughts?",1,0.528,0.999,NEGATIVE

I think they believe that data center means something that is not cloud like but rather a super computer that is shipped to someone who then uses it in the cloud. And that's it they ship the hardware and Nvidia never sees them again. That's not what is going on here. First, Nvidia can direct sell you cloud like access to all their hardware and software services all by themselves. NVIDIA DGX Cloud is a serverless, AI-training-as-a-service platform for enterprises that depend on AI. With integrated best-in-class software, direct access to NVIDIA AI experts, and near-limitless access to high-performance compute, DGX Cloud delivers industry-leading utilization efficiency with scale and productive work capacity for developers—at the lowest TCO compared with traditional infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) approaches. Dan Nathan just seems either confused or just willfully attempting to rally a short position. I lean to the latter because I can't believe he is actually believing what he is saying but I could be wrong. Maybe Dan is just confused. Second, You can then access Nvidia with all of it's software and services FROM effectively a third party such as Azure or AWS. Why would someone go this route? The reason is many times companies have contracts in place to get discounted compute from 1 or 2 cloud providers. So, they sort of go all in with Microsoft Azure as an example. The legal and contract agreements are in place for the entire IT department to use ""whatever"" is in Azure. Well, if Nvidia cloud can be accessed in Azure that's great because all of the engineers and DS's can have access without going through and getting agreements in place for Nvidia directly. There is obviously the chance of more cost but for the lack of headache it is probably negligible. But, every situation is different. Point is, that is money that is going directly to Nvidia (and probably the serving cloud provider at some portion) because at that point Microsoft or AWS or Google is only a passthrough. This is very much the same for other provider as well such as MongoDB and Redis Labs. Now, on the other side Microsoft, X and AWS have every right to purchase, store and assemble their own solutions with purchased hardware from Nvidia and others and also provide and direct sale their own option. See that's the difference of HARDWARE sales and CLOUD INCOME. I haven't heard this on the conference calls and would be great if someone talked about it because it would become so much more clear. You must understand the distinction to understand Nvidia's current business model right now. Back to Gene. So the the mistake that everyone keeps making is that they're saying the BUST or the apocalypse MUST come for nvidia because once they sale all of the hardware then nobody is going to buy anymore. Thus the ""GLUT"". That's not how this is working. You have to get your mind out of the Crypto/NFT ponzi scheme to understand this. Crypto had a bunch of GPU's going up against a supply / demand model of increasing BitCoin price. When the bitcoin price crashed. Everyone holding a warehouse of GPU's costing millions in electricity suddenly didn't want to be a bitcoin miner anymore. Hence, a bunch of GPU's that nobody wanted. The ""GLUT"". This was probably max of Bitcoin falling to ~12000. It's also why ETH and others wanted to go to ASICS and get off the Bitcoin hype cycle. Nobody talks about AWS or Azure or Google's ""GLUT"" concern with bought servers and hardware. Nobody. AWS and Azure update their cloud server options all of the time. It's a natural cycle that is smooth and calculated. Why is it not conceivable that this will be similar for Nvidia? Everyone is trying to predict the day Nvidia falls instead of trying to think ""hmm"" maybe, just maybe, Nvidia is growing as a cloud offering with software, hardware and service. Sound like IaaS? Because it is. It's the same concept as general compute but with accelerated compute. The software stack is why you would go for Nvidia as opposed to using a different cloud provider native abstraction. MongoDB in Azure Cosmos is not as good as MongoDB direct to Mongo IN Azure. Or at least that might be a consideration for you. Speaking of Data storage companies one could make an analogy here. Data gets stored and then you access said data. LLM's get trained and then you access said LLM. The only difference is that the LLM needs compute to run it. Less than training compute but still accelerated compute. The training doesn't happen one time and that's it. You could train a model and it suck and then you have to retrain it. Or you need to update it so you have to retrain it. The money it cost to train is in the million's. multiple millions of dollars for foundational LLM's. There will be no more glut here than there is in any other cloud providers for general compute. There will not be a ""BUST"" this time. So don't worry Dan, you can come out of the shorts and join the rest of us into the future.","Thanks for taking the time to give your thoughts. It is amazing how the technology productized primarily for gaming has evolved into so many non-gaming related use cases. If they knew this was going to happen ten years ago that's incredibly prescient, but it's also good to be at the right place at the right time.So given all their success I'm looking around at the other big tech companies with billions to spend and today they're deciding it's cheaper to buy than DIY. An example of a company picking the DIY approach is Apple when they decided to get into chip design and ditch Intel. I've watched Apple evolve for a long time and I still think it's impressive how that was executed. Apple is using it's chip design capabilities in support of it's own product designs, of course, not big data/AI compute, and I'm not suggesting they're likely to pivot, but it's an example of a company successfully getting into chip design for a strategic purpose and a chip maker losing some business.Along those lines, MSFT with OpenAI and Azure won't want to buy from NVDA forever. What I think is most likely is that for the time being NVDA will own the vast majority of the market but a big tech (like MSFT but it doesn't have to be them) will eventually launch a competing product. When? No clue, maybe a few years? Maybe five years? When that happens Wall Street will probably react like the party's over and NVDA's valuation will correct quickly and painfully unless they already have a firm grasp on the next generation of tech you're talking about. So for the meantime NVDA is essentially selling shovels in a gold rush. I'm just poking at how much protection there is around that core business and how long until ""Billy G's Discount Shovel Emporium"" shows up across the street. If it's not coming through clearly, in my head I'm building a case for investing even at today's valuation (in a long term buy and hold style) but I'm trying to figure out future expectations if/when the market gets more crowded.",2,0.554,0.997,NEGATIVE

However, chip design on general purpose compute is a few steps down from accelerated compute. This is particle physics, math, geometry (well math lol). So the supporting software and architecture is a bit different - that's 1 single chip. Remember, 35000 parts that weighs 70 Lbs. That will not be easily emulated let alone the IP on that.",3,0.523,0.975,NEGATIVE
