,"I was just speaking with a (potential) financial advisor today. He discussed, for example how the S&P 500 is way overweighted in tech, particularly because 7 of the top 10 holdings are all megatech giants: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, Google/Alphabet (twice), and Tesla. These 7 alone make up 21% of the value of the S&P 500. Obviously, this leads to underweighting in other sectors. And this leads to underperformance and increased volatility over long periods of time. As evidence of this, he brought up a chart that showed that if you equally weight your investments across the various sectors (financials, materials, utilities, healthcare, etc.), that it would outperform the S&P 500, provided that you rebalance periodically. Has anyone heard of an investment portfolio like this? I did a little research, and it looks like for periods of 15 years or greater, this is right - an portfolio that's equally weighted by sector, and rebalanced periodically, will outperform the S&P by 1.5% to 2% annually. I'd love to hear your thoughts about this. Anyone have a portfolio like this? Is there some kind of equal weighting ETF or mutual fund that does this automatically? Thanks.","If you'd looked at the same data 2 years ago you'd be glad the S&P500 was tech heavy as that sector was flying. You can't always base your investment decisions on yesterday's performance, you have to take a calculated risk on what you think the best sectors will be in 5,10 or 20 years",0,0.531,0.932,NEGATIVE

This is very different than saying it WILL.Market cap weighting could be thought of as pulling in long term momentum. That is, over time, the parts that are working, grow.

Their fees - it's Empower - are 0.9% annually, so that's all they have to beat the S&P by (which is where I have the bulk of my portfolio right now - self-investing, as you say, which I've been doing for decades). If they beat it by more than that, yay.Even if they don't, however, it's really not the end of the world. They're going to be doing more than just buying and selling in my retirement accounts. Tax planning/avoidance, tax loss harvesting, diversifying my portfolio into bonds (which I have been semi-loathe to do myself), etc. Y'know, the whole financial schmear.Plus, I get the first six months for free; if I want, I can see what they're doing, learn from it, and then replicate it going forward.Could I do this all myself? Sure; like I mentioned, I have been, for decades. But as I get closer to retirement, I don't want to f this up by accident somehow. I only get one shot at this, and it's good to have someone - even if I'm paying that someone about $4500 per year - to look out for my half million (and growing) in retirement. That $4500 is piece of mind.On the other hand, it's A LOT for piece of mind, I'll admit it.I haven't completely made up my mind yet, so I'm still willing to be talked into continuing to do this myself, if you're so inclined.",1,0.531,0.944,NEGATIVE
