A 75 year old can have investing questions too.But the guy up there is right and this forum shouldn’t be about ultra short plays. First off, we’d get overwhelmed with ppl trying to time the market at the minute level—and using a clunky 1990s style website to do it.I’m a big nvidia bull, and I’m still invested. I’m sitting on some cash now cuz it’s weird times and my comfort level is off.But that’s me. All investors need to move at their owncomfort levels. If 5 ppl on a website tell you to invest tomorrow and you’re not entirely comfortable with it, your going to be kicking yourself and unduly stressed.And if you ARE comfortable with the advice of 5 random ppl on Reddit…why? Use the forum to get hints and backup your own analysis. But jeez, you’re not a trained seal, are you?",2,0.525,NEGATIVE,1.0

So the demand for chips alone doesn’t benefit them. Their current design, supported by the propriety software alone, is already being cracked and hit hard.

GPU's are essential for AI and those things,"Forget all of the ""I think you're in this wrong sub"" comments. Their point is that there is a lot more to investing than just picking one stock. Nvidia is indeed a great stock but one of the key tenants of investing is to both understand your portfolio and diversify it. It also depends on what sort of investor you want to be. Are you going to be looking at your portfolio every day? Are you going to trade every day or do you just want to set & forget? if you want to learn about it then? Perhaps it's okay to be a ""look at it every day"" trader but if you just want to sit and forget, then invest in an index ETF to start like VOO or QQQ...and just add the same amount ebery week, like you were putting money into a piggy bank.

GPU's are essential for AI and those things,When looking at a correction and when it is probably over you should look to the S&P which has plenty of room to drop. Corrections usually happen over a month or 3. Not to mention in a correction some individual stocks often lose more than the indicies (especially when the indicies are largely propped by them to begin with like anything in the Mag 7 like nidivia).
