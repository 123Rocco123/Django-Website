,"I'm fairly heavy in High Tech stocks (Nvidia, Apple, VGT). The YTD return is excellent, but I've already been through three market shakeouts--Dot Com; the GFC; and the Crypto Crash starting in Nov. 2021. This time I'm thinking of getting smart and putting ""Trailing Stop Orders"" of 10% on those stocks to sell when they go down 10% from their recent peak. Do you think that is a good idea?",Trailing stop order is also a great way for market movers to trigger your stop loss and immediately pump up the stock back up.,0,0.581,1.0,POSITIVE

If you're time horizon is long (say 20 years), then you could care less if there's a sharp decline today, because you're not going to sell anyways.Looking back, the decline in 2020 due to COVID is irrelevant today.

Do you think that is a good idea?","This is a legitimate concern but modern markets have made trailing stop orders a horrible idea. The last big crash market makers had to use actually capital (imagine that!) to flash crash a stock down to trigger your order, and let the market slingshot it back up. Now with commission free brokers, PFOF, and the magnitude of darkpools, they only have to route orders off exchange at the right time to widen the bid-ask wide enough to trigger. It costs them pennies on the dollar from what it used to.Because they pay for most broker's order flow data, they see exactly how many shares will trigger at any given price before anyone else in the market. I feel like at these prices, all it takes is a whiff of fear for them to start these shenanigans again.",0,0.537,0.505,NEGATIVE
