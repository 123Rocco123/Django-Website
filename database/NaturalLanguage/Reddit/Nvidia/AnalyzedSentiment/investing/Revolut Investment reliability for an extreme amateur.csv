,I’ve been making some small investments into Nvidia and MSoft and of course gold but I’m not sure if Revolut is a reliable way to invest in terms of being on time for the market openings/closures and the buy/sell rates if they’re late or not. Idk if it makes sense. Another question being what other investments should I look into as I want a vast portfolio to give myself more options without risk of losing too much in the event of a crash,"Pretty sure there are better stock plaforms compared to Revolut. I would suggest checking the fees. Is there a fee each time you buy/sell a stock. What are the spreads like in Revolut compared to other platforms, more often that not Revolut would not be as good in terms of this metrics.Shameless advertising here. for any begineers to investing.Try out my new udemy investing course, which would go thorugh step by step on how to choose, evaluate and buy a great stock.

Another question being what other investments should I look into as I want a vast portfolio to give myself more options without risk of losing too much in the event of a crash,"I personally don’t think you should invest in individual stocks, but that’s obviously up to you. Any amount, regularly, into an index fund is going to net you profits, in the long term.It’s been proven that people that invest in passive index funds, come out with higher gains than trying to gamble on stocks. Yes, can you get lucky and make it big? Of course. That’s the American dream, it’s definitely not normal, nor should be expected.Passively investing in index funds, like VOO, will get you rich in 30-40+ years.

Another question being what other investments should I look into as I want a vast portfolio to give myself more options without risk of losing too much in the event of a crash,"Hi guys!Are there any platforms you would recommend for starting to invest in index funds, like Interactive Brokers or Degiro? I was thinking of using Revolut, but I found out that you can't invest in index funds with it. I am a resident of Europe, but I have dollars in PayPal.Additionally, I would like to ask what you think about buying bonds. I read in a comment in another discussion that ""you can't invest in US ETFs unless you're a professional trader."" What is the reason for this?Thanks!",3,0.511,NEGATIVE,1.0

Another question being what other investments should I look into as I want a vast portfolio to give myself more options without risk of losing too much in the event of a crash,I've been using revolut for 3+ years without any real issues (stock-wise) be aware they do delist when stocks drop their market cap (won't effect you with Microsoft or nvidia obviously).I've had issues with their crypto investing as they've delisted coins and stopped stake rewards with little notice (but again if your not interested in this rev is fine)that being said they don't support index funds so if your wanting to switch your strategy like the above poster suggests you'll need to move to another platform.,0,0.547,NEGATIVE,0.67

I think I’ll stick with rev based off of the way I want to approach stocks for the time being but I think expanding my knowledge would benefit me in any future shareholder interests I may have, the same with gold investments",1,0.53,NEGATIVE,0.795

Obviously you should only trade which what you can afford to lose so it sounds like your doing the right thing.I would say at such an early age be careful not to fall into the trap I've seen so many do (including myself at 1 point) and become so focused on money... Money ultimately for me is there to be spent, I have some friends who I've seen have millions in the bank and still not spend anything while working super hard to get more... That's just addiction to me and from what I've seen develops mainly in young traders",2,0.513,NEGATIVE,0.826
