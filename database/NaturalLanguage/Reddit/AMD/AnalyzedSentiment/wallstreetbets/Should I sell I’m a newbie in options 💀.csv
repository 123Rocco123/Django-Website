I learned something in my first 2 months of options trading. I had an SMCI put that cost 12K. I think the strike price was 900 or something. I was up 50% at one time. I didn‚Äôt take profit and it ended up expiring worthless. That was an $18K total movement in my portfolio. That was more than I liked. I have rules now that I take profit when option x% when the option expires in x weeks for example. Since I have employed that I have been doing better. I could be sitting on more $ in some occasions if I held. But I don‚Äôt care. On to the next opportunity.I sold a PLTR call when I was up 50%. If I held I could have been up 500% possibly at one point. Guess what happened on the date the opt expired? Back down to 50% gain. I can‚Äôt beat the market in total by holding or timing it.
