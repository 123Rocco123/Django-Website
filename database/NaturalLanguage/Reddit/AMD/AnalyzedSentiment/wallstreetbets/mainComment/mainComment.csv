Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year. This report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure.

Market is expecting a healthy stable growth, now that we are near equilibrium with AI and chips, ( this is obviously not true, but it's the arguments bears try to hang on. They think Amazon will overtake a 30 year CUDA industry software environment the entire world/industry has created THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AROUND). Go look up CUDA. It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four...

NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming Latest Sept 2025, with my guess, Jensen starts marketing from first half of 2025, and wider release commercially of NVDA CPU for 1st qtr of 2026, March, me thinks Jensen starts getting market ready all of 2025 for release in the wild September 2025 for retail user and full wider release by March 2026 / end of February 2026. Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?.. I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about. And as far as I know, Biden or Trump won't block sales of regular computer pc windows chips to China or anywhere else for that matter. :) Imagine being the king of accelerated compute and now you have a cpu + gpu combo ARM chip that runs silent like Apple M chips and sips low power like such, but games and does AI and any heavy compute intense task very wicked like, very retail level computer chip level like that is specifically from the box ready to work with cuda and marry with existing nvidia gpu's at the hyperscaler level to even more efficiently run AI intense software and on prem (on the laptop or pc itself without cloud compute help, like QCOM snapdragon Elite PC boasts it can do(but sucks, incompatible with lots of software and games, not so with nvda).

"AMD Q3 Preview EPS Jumps 30% YoY, Close Gap with Nvidia.csv","AMD will release its Q3 earnings report on October 29th, after the U.S. markets close. Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year. This report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure. With Nvidia's earnings report on the horizon, AMD's results offer a useful benchmark. Although AMD has significantly underperformed Nvidia year-to-date, this could be an opportunity to turn the tables. Data Center Growth is Key Analysts predict AMD's data center revenue will reach a record $3.52 billion for Q3. In July, CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in strong revenue growth for the year's second half, driven by demand for Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. Earlier this month, AMD launched its latest data center AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, and investors are keen to see its performance. Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari pointed to sustained growth in AI infrastructure capital expenditure, a recovery in server CPUs, and AMD's ongoing market share gains. AMD's x86 server CPU market share rose to 34% by Q2 2024 from less than 20% in early 2022, and Goldman Sachs expects AMD's next-generation server CPUs could further extend its edge over Intel Corp.",0.6043,"['POSITIVE', 0.9866]"

"AMD Q3 Preview EPS Jumps 30% YoY, Close Gap with Nvidia.csv","AMD will release its Q3 earnings report on October 29th, after the U.S. markets close. Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year. This report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure. With Nvidia's earnings report on the horizon, AMD's results offer a useful benchmark. Although AMD has significantly underperformed Nvidia year-to-date, this could be an opportunity to turn the tables. Data Center Growth is Key Analysts predict AMD's data center revenue will reach a record $3.52 billion for Q3. In July, CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in strong revenue growth for the year's second half, driven by demand for Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. Earlier this month, AMD launched its latest data center AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, and investors are keen to see its performance. Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari pointed to sustained growth in AI infrastructure capital expenditure, a recovery in server CPUs, and AMD's ongoing market share gains. AMD's x86 server CPU market share rose to 34% by Q2 2024 from less than 20% in early 2022, and Goldman Sachs expects AMD's next-generation server CPUs could further extend its edge over Intel Corp.",0.6043,"['POSITIVE', 0.9866]"

Luckly, I just came out of a similar trade on B.Riley and kinda figured if those frauds can get away with not filing financials on time for over 180 days and they are still trading, there is no way SMCI will get delisted. I buy 250 $34.5 strike weekly calls on SMCI at $0.50 a pop. That’s a ~$12,500, baby position babbyyy. Why $34.5 calls? idk whats funnier than $34? $34.5. Also I looked at where it dropped when EY announced they wouldn't proceed as their auditors amd $34.5 is about the level they closed at that day. Finally, $34.5 is within my personal risk tolerance. guh Today, I’m minding my own business, scrolling Reddit, eating a sandwich, watching Ana De Armas AI Porn, minding my own business. My phone buzzes, and it’s my buddy. This guy texts me out of nowhere, “Man, I think I’m fucked. I sold $34.5 naked calls on SMCI this week.

If everything holds up and SMCI opens strong tomorrow, this guy is about to be bent over a financial barrel, down 500% at open (das what the app is saying rn at least). He thought he was playing it safe, slinging naked calls like he’s DFV or something, and now he’s unknowingly writing me a fat f***ing check for $62,000 (so far). He knows I bought SMCI calls. I mentioned it in passing, like, “Yeah, I’m in on SMCI this week.” But he doesn’t know how many or what strike. I didn’t tell him I went full-blown degenerate with $12.5K on a strike so far out of the money. Now I’m sitting here, “Do I tell him?” Like, “Hey bro, funny story, you’re about to owe me your next three paychecks because I’m holding all the cards—and by cards, I mean your fuckiing calls.” Or do I keep my mouth shut and let the market gods do what they do? I feel bad, but not that bad, you know? Trading is a tough game isn't it? No mercy. So that’s where I'm going to hold a little past open and then I’m cashing in big-time, and he’s gonna be selling plasma to cover his losses. What would you guys do?

"AMD Q3 Preview EPS Jumps 30% YoY, Close Gap with Nvidia.csv","AMD will release its Q3 earnings report on October 29th, after the U.S. markets close. Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year. This report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure. With Nvidia's earnings report on the horizon, AMD's results offer a useful benchmark. Although AMD has significantly underperformed Nvidia year-to-date, this could be an opportunity to turn the tables. Data Center Growth is Key Analysts predict AMD's data center revenue will reach a record $3.52 billion for Q3. In July, CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in strong revenue growth for the year's second half, driven by demand for Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. Earlier this month, AMD launched its latest data center AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, and investors are keen to see its performance. Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari pointed to sustained growth in AI infrastructure capital expenditure, a recovery in server CPUs, and AMD's ongoing market share gains. AMD's x86 server CPU market share rose to 34% by Q2 2024 from less than 20% in early 2022, and Goldman Sachs expects AMD's next-generation server CPUs could further extend its edge over Intel Corp.",0.6043,"['POSITIVE', 0.9866]"

AI chipmaker Cerebras files for IPO to take on Nvidia - But 87% of its revenues have come from the U.csv,"The Middle East wants chips badly but US restrictions prevent the US most powerful chips entering into certain geographical areas such as China and the Middle East; this entails the UAE. Nevertheless, the UAE wants in on the GPU chips craze and is apparently willing to pay anything to enter into the chip bonanza. The UAE can't get Nvidia's, AMD's, or Intel's best GPU chips so instead they are investing heavily into alternatives such as Cerebras. There is nothing inherently wrong with this but it's also the biggest red flag as an investment opportunity. If the agreements for Nvidia chips open up in the Middle East and specifically with the UAE that could be a crushing blow to this aspiring startup. Specifically, Cerebras Systems reported a net loss of $66.6 million for the first six months of 2024, on $136.4 million in revenue. For the same period in 2023 it has a net loss of $77.8 million on just $8.7 million in sales. 87% of this revenue for the first half of 2024 was directly from the UAE G42. The other red flag from this startup is the way in which they promote their business. It's all seemingly smoke and mirrors and conveniently based on outdated GPU pricing and throughput information; which is very publically available. For some reason, Groq and Cerebras love to keep using memory to unlock speeds on small/tiny models which is impractical and inefficient for a scaled system; or a system that is a large foundational LLM. As well, they have no clue what models will do next so it's a major after the fact architecture that uses llama because they have access to it. https://cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebras-inference-ai-at-instant-speed. A prime example of this is OpenAI's GPT-o1 model that uses reasoning in coordination with its model capabilities. Because they are not being used on the forefront of this technology they don't know how or when a model's size, function, or needs will evolve into the future. All of this plus the pricing from OpenAI and Microsoft is coming down exponentially. For Example: They are referring to a 70b param model that shoves an entire model onto memory. They are going up against h100's which is a very old technology at this point. They make no reference to h200's let alone blackwell Because they are referencing such a small model the pricing model they suggest would be radically different for a 400b param model and forget about trillion param models which are coming next. They're not being truthful about tokens per s. As of today this is Azure GPT 4o and GPT 4 mini tokens per minute gpt-4o & GPT-4 Turbo global standard Model Tier Quota Limit in tokens per minute (TPM) Requests per minute gpt-4o Enterprise agreement 30 M 180 K gpt-4o-mini Enterprise agreement 50 M 300 As you can clearly see 30 million tokens per minute is 500k tokens per second and mini is 833,333 tokens per second. So i don't know why they are referring to 20 tokens per second or their 450 tokens per second seems way off. maybe they mean million. Even if that is the case and 70 b would be more like mini it is way higher than their limit. On pricing which they lay out a 3:1 input versus output is fine the price would be for mini which is a comparable model is roughly .10 cents (input) + .20 cents = .30 cents. Per million. for regular 4o it would be higher and let's face it GPT 4o is a far superior model than llama 3.1 3.33 dollar + 5 = $8.33 Source: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/ From this information what I can tell you is that what we just went over is pricing. it is not some guarantee for what a model produces per second. That shit is very random. What I can tell you is from GPT 4 to GPT 4 turbo to Gpt 4o the speed is dramatically better. GPT 4o mini is damn near real time. Take that for what it's worth. I am not saying they're being dishonest here but I am saying they are being very cheeky with how they advertise things. The company is currently being primarily supported by the UAE, with investments worth roughly $900 million for new AI supercomputers known as the Condor Galaxy series. Any growth here is singular to this source of investment and not driven by organic growth or usage. This is not a competitor to Nvidia but rather a temporary solution in the Middle East until chip embargoes are alleviated. The media here loves to use sexy headlines on non-technical verifications of what it is they are actually comparing. I.e. H100's are now old, or The fact an entity may need to serve millions of clients... No they are instead reporting self-prompting headlines from Cerebras that say things like our chips are 20x faster than Nvidia. Live Update: As I am writing and researching this topic it has just been reported by Reuters that the U.S. is setting a new rule to allow chip shipments to the Middle East including the UAE which is a boon to Nvidia and Microsoft. US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East Here are couple excerpts: WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), to data centers in the Middle East. G42, a UAE-based AI company with historic ties to China, has been a focus of those concerns. In April, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), opens new tab announced that it would invest $1.5 billion in the company, with plans to provide G42 with chips and model weights, sophisticated data that improves an AI model's ability to emulate human reasoning.The deal drew scrutiny from China hardliners in Congress, even though G42 said in February that it had divested from China and was accepting constraints imposed on it by the United States to work with American companies. LOL you can't make this up. Literally this just got reported by Reuters today 9/30/2024. This completely aligns with my argument above regarding the UAE-G42. With chips now entering into the Middle East from Nvidia and potentially others I don't know how this startup IPO makes it off the ground. I don't mean to be bearish but I don't think this is the time for them to raise an IPO without showing more progress. I could be wrong. As of now, I don't plan on buying any shares.

"AMD Q3 Preview EPS Jumps 30% YoY, Close Gap with Nvidia.csv","AMD will release its Q3 earnings report on October 29th, after the U.S. markets close. Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year. This report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure. With Nvidia's earnings report on the horizon, AMD's results offer a useful benchmark. Although AMD has significantly underperformed Nvidia year-to-date, this could be an opportunity to turn the tables. Data Center Growth is Key Analysts predict AMD's data center revenue will reach a record $3.52 billion for Q3. In July, CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in strong revenue growth for the year's second half, driven by demand for Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. Earlier this month, AMD launched its latest data center AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, and investors are keen to see its performance. Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari pointed to sustained growth in AI infrastructure capital expenditure, a recovery in server CPUs, and AMD's ongoing market share gains. AMD's x86 server CPU market share rose to 34% by Q2 2024 from less than 20% in early 2022, and Goldman Sachs expects AMD's next-generation server CPUs could further extend its edge over Intel Corp.",0.6043,"['POSITIVE', 0.9866]"

Bloomberg Again Reports on Semiconductors With Flimsy Information on Secret Government Contacts.csv,"Usually, when things that are leaked with an intention the entity where the leak comes from is pleased with said leak. Not for Bloomberg though. Bloomberg actually accomplishes citing an anonymous source about on ongoing discussions related to chip distribution and subsequently takes that information to the White House National Security Council to ask them to comment. Here is the WHNSC's response. Bloomberg: US Weighs Capping Exports of AI Chips From Nvidia and AMD to Some Countries A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the talks but pointed to a recent joint statement by the US and UAE on artificial intelligence. In it, the two countries acknowledged the “tremendous potential of AI for good,” as well as the “challenges and risks of this emerging technology and the vital importance of safeguards.” The council responds with a no comment while directing them to a positive statement. To me, this greatly diminishes whomever the Bloomberg contact is. This is the second time that Bloomberg goes out of their way citing a leaky government source that on it's own merits isn't really that sensational at all. The headline is sensational the reality is not. The approach would set a ceiling on export licenses for certain countries in the interest of national security, according to the people, who described the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Officials are focused on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing appetite for AI data centers and the deep pockets to fund them, the people said. This isn't even news. Reuters reported on this a month ago with a much more neutral to positive tone. Which it is. Reuters: US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia to data centers in the Middle East.Since October 2023, U.S. exporters have been required to obtain licenses before shipping advanced chips to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.Under the new rule, data centers will be able to apply for Validated End User status that will allow them to receive chips under a general authorization, rather than requiring their U.S. suppliers to obtain individual licenses to ship to them. If you're tracking, this simply seems to be the 2nd half of that original conversation. There are already chip restrictions. Nvidia is already not delivering the most advanced chips to those countries. The framework proposed would allow Nvidia to deliver chips under certain restrictions and guidelines. Bloomberg acknowledges this towards the tail end of the article. While officials have debated the best approach, they’ve slowed high-volume AI chip license approvals to the Middle East and elsewhere. But there are signs things could get moving soon: Under the new rules for shipments to data centers, US officials will vet and preapprove specific customers based on security commitments from both the companies and their national governments, paving the way for easier licensing down the road. What I don't understand is why does Bloomberg like to make things salacious when they're seemingly not. There is 0 chips to parts of the Middle-East today, but the U.S. government is working on a framework that may relieve that. Reuter story from a month ago. The end.

I wait all year for this opportunity - now I'm going to share it with you.csv,"If you trade long enough, you begin to see patterns emerge. On October 30th, one of my favorite patterns is starting. If you buy AMD stock on the last Monday of October, the average return for the rest of the year is 24.52%, and the stock is higher 88.89% of the time. This data starts in 2015 because it is the first full year after Dr. Lisa Su became CEO of AMD. Some of you may be wondering why this period is so strong for AMD stock. Let me share my personal theory. AMD depends on TSMC for chip manufacturing. Taiwan is protected by its geography and weather, but the Chinese have two windows of opportunity to cross the Strait with favorable weather. The first is from late March to the end of April. The second is from late September to late October. Last year, China launched major military exercises around Taiwan in April. This year, they did it in October, which just ended a few days ago. (They also launch these exercises when they are provoked, such as when Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan or during the recent Taiwanese elections.) In my view, the end of October triggers a relief rally in stocks related to TSMC, most notably AMD and Nvidia. This combines with earnings and strong seasonality, resulting in massive outperformance in a relatively short period of time. A quick word of warning—this time period includes earnings. If you want to avoid earnings risk, you can wait until the first Monday of November. If you wait until November, the average return is 19.06%, and the stock is higher 77.78% of the time by the end of the year.

Intel is a good buy.csv,"We are all well aware Intel is having it's own Boeing moment right now with design flaws in their CPUs and horrible customer service. They deserve the steaming pile dooky that is currently sitting atop their share value. That being said, they have an ace that may flip the entire market on it's head: They own their fabs. That's right: all the other big boys in town design and give their blueprints for TSMC to manufacture. That's true of AMD, Nvidia, and other ARM and mobile chip designers. Intel is the only large scale chip designers that is more or less vertically integrated. As you may know, they just got $8.8B from papa Biden to build more foundries in Ohio and Arizona, in addition to their other sites across the world. None of this is particularly noteworthy until you consider that China has always been very interested in Chinesing Taiwan, and are even more so now that they have been embargoed from Nvidia chips by the US. The Chinese military build-up over the past decade has focused heavily on amphibious warfare, and long range anti-naval weapons (think carrier buster ballistic/boost-glide stand off weapons.) It doesn't take a Ph.D in geopolitics to understand what the move is here. On the US/allied side, the discourse around Taiwan has slowly shifted: what started out as ""we have overwhelming force and we will stop any attempt at an invasion of Taiwan"" has become something like ""Maybe we can't stop them from invading, but we can make it a Pyrrhic victory"". This may actually be the case, but the trend is not great. You will have noticed Taiwan has been increasingly politically isolated, mirroring the growing Chinese military power in the region. So what happens to TSMC if Taiwan gets Chinesed? As you can imagine, China is interested in acquiring as many TSMC assets and personnel intact as possible. This means you can bet your degenerate bacon that US intelligence services have contingencies to extradite key scientists and engineers, and scuttle the production plants and machines before the Chinese can take control of them. But the result is easy to predict: no more TSMC. This means the personnel extradited will be used to advise and run US production plants owned by, you guessed it: Intel. Intel will have a quasi monopoly on chip manufacturing. The US government see this of course, that's why they are strongly nudging Nvidia to play nice with Intel, because they see a potential future where Intel is the only player in town capable of making Nvidia chips, or any consumer chips at all for that matter, in the West.

First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs. An additional benefit is that Intel can leverage their fabs in order to achieve higher margins for their own products. It's possible Intel's stock could be hit again in a month or so when their report comes out, but they are likely already at bottom.",0.5493,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9999]"

Is INTC undervalued .csv,"Valuation Analysis of Intel Corporation Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has long been a key player in the semiconductor industry, but recent market developments and the rise of competitors like AMD and Nvidia have caused its stock to significantly underperform relative to its peers. As of Q2 2024, Intel’s total assets amount to approximately $182 billion, with liabilities around $91 billion, resulting in a net asset value of $91 billion. Yet, its market capitalization is around $95 billion, reflecting an almost 1:1 ratio between market cap and net assets. In contrast, competitors such as AMD and Nvidia trade at significantly higher premiums, indicating that the market may be underpricing Intel’s growth potential. Company Market Cap (Billion $) Net Assets (Billion $) Price to Net Asset Ratio Intel 95 91 1.04 AMD 266 56.5 4.71 Nvidia 3,000 58.15 51.58 Understanding Intel’s Valuation The Price to Net Asset Ratio (P/NAV) is a critical measure of how the market values a company relative to its net assets. Intel's current P/NAV of 1.04 reveals that its market value is nearly identical to its net assets, a valuation that appears surprisingly low, particularly when compared to its competitors. AMD and Nvidia, for instance, demonstrate P/NAV ratios of 4.71 and 51.58, respectively. This significant gap highlights the possibility that Intel is undervalued, especially given its strong fundamentals and growth potential. Several factors support this assessment. Despite facing fierce competition, Intel remains a leader in the semiconductor industry, known for its quality and innovation. The company is making substantial investments in new technologies and manufacturing capabilities, positioning itself to capitalize on growing trends such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, Intel boasts a robust balance sheet, with total assets of about $182 billion and liabilities around $91 billion. This financial strength provides a solid foundation for future growth and strategic initiatives. Although the recent decision to lay off 15,000 employees might seem concerning, it is part of a broader strategy to enhance operational efficiency and focus on core competencies, enabling Intel to adapt more effectively to evolving market demands. A key factor influencing Intel's future is the increasing global demand for semiconductors. As technology becomes more integrated into daily life, the need for high-performance chips continues to rise. Intel's resources and commitment to innovation position it to capture a larger share of this expanding market. Moreover, government support for the semiconductor industry adds another layer of potential upside for Intel. Given the strategic importance of semiconductor manufacturing in light of global supply chain challenges, particularly concerning the Taiwan-China situation, there is growing interest from government entities to bolster domestic semiconductor production. This focus on strengthening local supply chains can create favorable conditions for Intel, as it could receive both financial incentives and regulatory support to expand its operations and enhance its competitive positioning. Conclusion In summary, Intel Corporation is significantly undervalued based on its current P/NAV ratio. The company possesses strong assets, a history of innovation, and a strategic focus on future technologies. As Intel continues to execute its strategic plans and navigate market challenges, it has substantial potential to regain its competitive edge and achieve remarkable growth. Furthermore, the increasing government interest in supporting semiconductor manufacturing amid geopolitical uncertainties enhances Intel's prospects. The market's current valuation does not adequately reflect Intel's true value and growth potential, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

Long-time AMD Holder (Cost Basis 1904) Starting to Sell - Anyone Else Disappointed in the Stock in 2.csv,"Wrote about my thinking below... Out of the 31 large banks, 25 have a “buy” rating and 6 have a “hold” rating on AMD 0.29%↑. It’s hard to think about why to sell when everyone is telling you to buy, but I am of the opinion that is when it should be most deeply considered. image credit to tipranks.com AMD has been my most profitable investment of the past 5 years, having risen 800% since purchased in August of 2018. For most investors (including myself), it’s difficult to part with winners. Not only that, I am someone who believes AI will proliferate throughout society in the coming years. Because they design data center GPUs, AMD should be one of the primary beneficiaries as the AI boom continues. It might seem counter-intuitive then to sell the stock here, but that is what I’ve begun doing over the past two weeks. I had high hopes for AMD this year, but it’s my view that they've failed to take significant data center GPU market share from Nvidia, and will have increased competition from Intel's new product offerings (on both client and data center), as well as proprietary silicon from large cloud players (Google, Amazon, etc). My original thesis was that AMD would profit from overextended Nvidia margins in 2024, but this underestimated the CUDA ecosystem moat that existed with Nvidia data center products (see Why I Got Nvidia Wrong). While most large cloud players want to diversify at least somewhat from Nvidia, they are still unable to do so without risking a competitive advantage with their own AI offerings. Add Intel into the mix, and the margin and market share pressure will be on AMD. The only player in the silicon value chain I think which can currently raise margins is TSMC (TSM 2.61%↑), but the geopolitical risk is too high for me to continue holding the stock (I sold my TSMC stake two weeks ago). On the PC (personal computer), Nvidia has always had a strong moat. It’s not just because they have the best performing products, but also because game developers are economically incentivized to optimize first (and often only) for the largest potential audience. This is similar to the moat CUDA protects on the data center side. One might think that Nvidia charging incredibly high prices for discrete graphics cards would cause them to lose share to AMD with consumers who directly purchase the products (as opposed to businesses who purchase the data center products). Yet Nvidia market share has only grown over the past few years. Data from Jon Peddie Research Why This Take Could Be Wrong: There is a lot of bullish momentum in the investor community around AMD currently from both professional commentators and retail investors (e.g. Twitter / X). Many people who had never heard of AMD 5 years ago are now saying to put money into the stock as it is Nvidia’s only pure AI competitor. As a result of this, AMD could see a dramatic rise on a positive earnings report later this month. In addition, I expect gaming revenues to surprise to the upside with the minor refresh of Xbox and Playstation consoles coming for holiday season. I still have ~260 shares of AMD remaining, and will likely hold to see if the stock jumps on the report. I think that AMD is extremely stretched in its current valuation (P/E of 205), and that any bad news could send it spiralling. Selling half of the remaining stake now is essentially a hedge against this possibility. Whatever happens with the earnings report, I will likely reduce my AMD holdings to zero in the next few months as I continue to lower exposure to companies reliant on Taiwan.",0.5591,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9976]"

I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest. The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY. First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"". Name Stock price EPS SP/EPS ratio AAPL 230 1,4 164 MSFT 413 2,95 140 AMD 145 0,16 1.035 META 516 5,16 100 AMZN 171 1,26 135 NVDA 116 0,68 170 As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price. But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list. AAPL Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits. How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new. But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more. MSFT They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are. They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy. They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office? AMD I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first. Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware. Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software. And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section. META They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value. ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS. AMZN The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL. NVDA AND OUR STAR CHILD. HOT TOPIC OF 2024. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper.

NVIDIA (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang Points to 1 Trillion Opportunity for the Company.csv,"Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the next few weeks until the US election would be “confusing” for many since no one could say anything with conviction about who is going to be in the White House. Lee said that the market is going to trade “well” into the upcoming Fed meeting where he expects “some” rate cuts amid the labor market needing support and positive inflation data. Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said: However, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive. For this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that a trillion dollars’ worth of general-purpose data centers will inevitably transition to accelerated computing. “We’re in a computer revolution,” Huang said, pointing out that the first wave of data center modernization is driven by generative AI, which he described as more than just a tool—it’s a skill. Huang also emphasized the need for “densification,” with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) aiming to make data centers more efficient by compressing them into smaller spaces. He discussed NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it. Nvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia. Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave. At Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range. Of course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.

NVIDIA’s next catalyst has to be sovereign AI.csv,"NVIDIA’s current valuation is not overtly expensive (FPER: 33, PEG: 1.61 according to FINVIZ) and the GPU orders for next year are all booked. Yet the stock is meeting strong resistance around $130. I think this is partially because a lot of people have been burned by CISCO during dot-com bubble and do not want to price in the future too much. But the real concern is that their revenue is almost entirely dependent on the rest of M7 and they are charging the big tech 80 % margin. The big tech, while being hammered by Wall Street for the increased CAPEX spending, indicated during last earning that they will not reduce their investment on AI. However, they did mention that they are/plan using their NPU (Google TPU, Tesla Dojo, AMD) to reduce the usage of NVIDIA GPU. Furthermore, GPT5 and Apple Intelligence should be available to the public by the end of this year. If these do not impress, the entire AI sector may see significant slowdown. But if GPT5 shows plateauing of performance while people find Apple Intelligence interesting, paradigm could shift toward smaller models and inference efficiency, again reducing the demand for NVIDIA. To justify significant increase in NVIDIA’s stock price, they need to show that they are not entirely dependent on the Big Tech. The only other potential buyers that have as much buying power are governments. Also, if the economy is going through downturns, governments have excuse to increase their spending. What I am paying attention to during the earning call is demonstration from NVIDIA that they are receiving significant demand from non-Big Tech such as governments.",0.5529,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9994]"

Strong AI and Semiconductor weeks ahead.csv,"Hi all, I think that AI and esp. Semiconductor Stocks have a couple of strong weeks ahead. Starting on Tuesday, October 15th 2024, the Open Compute Project (OCP) global summit takes place in San Jose, California. Between 9 AM and 11:30 AM there'll be short keynotes (each 12 mins) presented by Meta, NVidia, AI Clusters, Intel, AMD, Microsoft and Google (full schedule here). Now, I don't think that there'll be any big surprises. But the Summit still presents an opportunity for public remarks about how strong the demand is or what so ever. Also, there's an article that says that Broadcom (AVGO) is going to show case cutting-edge AI infrastructure. Further it is expected that Taiwan Semiconductor Company (TSM) and ASML Holding (ASML) will publish their Q3 earnings next week. TSM will present its earnings on October 17th 2024 at 14:00 Taiwan time / 02:00 Eastern Time. So pre-market movements will most likely be wild on Thursday as a large part of the industry relies on TSM. If TSM reports a great Q3 revenue, this could push Nvidia over the current all time high. Also according to Moore's law is dead, the first RTX 5000 series GPUs are ready to be sold, but are not released because of business reasons (here at 22:22). So they could still change their mind and ship in Q4. Next, it is rumored (by moore's law is dead) that AMD will release a new CPU by the end of October or early November, the 9800X3D which is an 8 Core Gaming CPU with 3D cache and it is expected that it will be the fastest gaming CPU releasing this year. Although Client is not as important for AMD, it will still be beneficial to have this CPU released before the holiday season. Especially since Zen5 Rysen has so far been viewed as rather disappointing. Moore's law is dead also mentions an RX 7650 GRE GPU, which could launch alongside Ryzen 9800X3D. Releasing a slightly refreshed and cheap RDNA3 GPU could be a good move by AMD to get rid of RDNA3 stock ahead of the RDNA4 launch in 2025. Since the Ryzen 9800X3D has not yet been anounced, I don't think that it has been priced in and could give the stock a slight boost to recover from the -4% last Thursday. Also, I although Investors were not excited about AMDs Advancing AI event, I think AMDs position in the market is still solid. According to the slides shown at the event, AMD Epic has increased its market share to 34%. And according to tests AMD Epyc Turin obliterates Xeon 6 Granite Rapids, while being cheaper. Because of this, I think AMD is in a good position to gain more server market share. Further, the news about Nvidia Blackwell being sold out for the next 12 Months is not only good news for Nvidia but also for AMD. Sure, everyone wants blackwell. but if one can't get blackwell and if AMD Instinct MI325X is faster than Nvidia Hopper (H200), then they might be able to win over customers from nvidia, who would like to buy blackwell but can't in due time. Also, AMDs earnings should be reported on October 29 2024. Due to Ryzen Zen5 being disappointing and there being apparently a large RDNA3 stock remaining. If AMDs Instinct systems are selling well, this would also be good news for Micron Industries (MU), which produces high bandwith memory (HBM3e). And then there's Intel. Their newest releases seem to have been disappointing. But they claim to be making progress with their foundries.

"The next tech giant Why HOOD, PLTR and DKNG are the investment opportunities of a lifetime (Part 1).csv","I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong. $AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice. $NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were. And so in true wsb fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB. There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long. From a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about. And so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry : If you are under 40 years old, $HOOD (Finance), $PLTR (Defense) and $DKNG (gambling) will 100x during your investment horizon.

"Why I think Intel is a Misunderstood, Undervalued Play – A Bet on 18A (+EV DD).csv","Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.",0.5307,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9997]"

Truthfully this has been the worst year of my life (and his obviously) in a lot of ways, but I've been investing since I was 16 (I'm 25 now). My dad worked in equities, so when he lost his ability to communicate effectively with me (and since I had significantly more income because I'm not paying rent) - I truthfully went ballistic on investing. Pretty much said fuck it, I'm living at home I don't need a 6 month emergency fund till I move out and went all-in. Granted 40% of my portfolio not listed here is in a 401k account entirely in the S&P 500 (set & forget just in case my equities went to hell as with the rest of my life lol). I believe in the margin of safety when investing. I like to invest in high-quality companies that generate lots of cash as the backbone of my portfolio. Since 2021 (before my dad got this cancer shit), I spoke with him and he basically said just look at the fundamentals of a company and invest in growth companies that you think will be around in 5-10 years. I look for value within growth stocks (i know paradoxical). Some of my icons in investing are David Tepper & Michael Burry. Again below is all my own experience and reflects only my own views and are not a recommendation of my company (corporate. disclaimer). My portfolio is heavily weighted (85%) between several stocks: AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL (So fucking cheap r u kidding me sorry), NVDA, AMZN, AMD, CRM, COST, RIVN (RIP), AVGO, VOO (ik not a stock) <-- I know semi(s) are very cyclical but i believe in holding all of these companies for 5-10 years, so I don't have to worry about temp. earnings beats/misses etc. Much easier to pick a stock and hold it for a while then it is to get the timing right. Roughly at 175% return in the past 3 years. (hammered META at $100's, NVDA at $200 both in 2022) Roughly 15% of my bets are moonshots (note the word bet hehe) with promise but objectively could be overvalued/bad investments: CCL/RCL (both are crushing it and between them own 75% of the cruise line market), LCID/RIVN (going to 0 bc they can't scale profitably or will make u a very happy person 3 years down the line bc R2/Atlas at 45k/50k should capture a significant portion of model y demand), TTD, DKNG/FLUT - gambling hasn't even been legalized in Cali/Texas (the biggest markets in the U.S. come on), RBLX (feels like betting against youtube in the early innings w/o realizing how much rev. they're actually recognizing), PYPL (value - cheap af (bought at $60) should turn around in a couple years) I joke I allocate like google's budget where it's 90% bread&butter and the rest are moonshots. Was very depressed (still reasonably depressed) because I'm not sure how much time my dad has. I hope in a way I can pass some of these stocks to my kid in a better place than I found it.

AI chipmaker Cerebras files for IPO to take on Nvidia - But 87% of its revenues have come from the U.csv,"The Middle East wants chips badly but US restrictions prevent the US most powerful chips entering into certain geographical areas such as China and the Middle East; this entails the UAE. Nevertheless, the UAE wants in on the GPU chips craze and is apparently willing to pay anything to enter into the chip bonanza. The UAE can't get Nvidia's, AMD's, or Intel's best GPU chips so instead they are investing heavily into alternatives such as Cerebras. There is nothing inherently wrong with this but it's also the biggest red flag as an investment opportunity. If the agreements for Nvidia chips open up in the Middle East and specifically with the UAE that could be a crushing blow to this aspiring startup. Specifically, Cerebras Systems reported a net loss of $66.6 million for the first six months of 2024, on $136.4 million in revenue. For the same period in 2023 it has a net loss of $77.8 million on just $8.7 million in sales. 87% of this revenue for the first half of 2024 was directly from the UAE G42. The other red flag from this startup is the way in which they promote their business. It's all seemingly smoke and mirrors and conveniently based on outdated GPU pricing and throughput information; which is very publically available. For some reason, Groq and Cerebras love to keep using memory to unlock speeds on small/tiny models which is impractical and inefficient for a scaled system; or a system that is a large foundational LLM. As well, they have no clue what models will do next so it's a major after the fact architecture that uses llama because they have access to it. https://cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebras-inference-ai-at-instant-speed. A prime example of this is OpenAI's GPT-o1 model that uses reasoning in coordination with its model capabilities. Because they are not being used on the forefront of this technology they don't know how or when a model's size, function, or needs will evolve into the future. All of this plus the pricing from OpenAI and Microsoft is coming down exponentially. For Example: They are referring to a 70b param model that shoves an entire model onto memory. They are going up against h100's which is a very old technology at this point. They make no reference to h200's let alone blackwell Because they are referencing such a small model the pricing model they suggest would be radically different for a 400b param model and forget about trillion param models which are coming next. They're not being truthful about tokens per s. As of today this is Azure GPT 4o and GPT 4 mini tokens per minute gpt-4o & GPT-4 Turbo global standard Model Tier Quota Limit in tokens per minute (TPM) Requests per minute gpt-4o Enterprise agreement 30 M 180 K gpt-4o-mini Enterprise agreement 50 M 300 As you can clearly see 30 million tokens per minute is 500k tokens per second and mini is 833,333 tokens per second. So i don't know why they are referring to 20 tokens per second or their 450 tokens per second seems way off. maybe they mean million. Even if that is the case and 70 b would be more like mini it is way higher than their limit. On pricing which they lay out a 3:1 input versus output is fine the price would be for mini which is a comparable model is roughly .10 cents (input) + .20 cents = .30 cents. Per million. for regular 4o it would be higher and let's face it GPT 4o is a far superior model than llama 3.1 3.33 dollar + 5 = $8.33 Source: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/ From this information what I can tell you is that what we just went over is pricing. it is not some guarantee for what a model produces per second. That shit is very random. What I can tell you is from GPT 4 to GPT 4 turbo to Gpt 4o the speed is dramatically better. GPT 4o mini is damn near real time. Take that for what it's worth. I am not saying they're being dishonest here but I am saying they are being very cheeky with how they advertise things. The company is currently being primarily supported by the UAE, with investments worth roughly $900 million for new AI supercomputers known as the Condor Galaxy series. Any growth here is singular to this source of investment and not driven by organic growth or usage. This is not a competitor to Nvidia but rather a temporary solution in the Middle East until chip embargoes are alleviated. The media here loves to use sexy headlines on non-technical verifications of what it is they are actually comparing. I.e. H100's are now old, or The fact an entity may need to serve millions of clients... No they are instead reporting self-prompting headlines from Cerebras that say things like our chips are 20x faster than Nvidia. Live Update: As I am writing and researching this topic it has just been reported by Reuters that the U.S. is setting a new rule to allow chip shipments to the Middle East including the UAE which is a boon to Nvidia and Microsoft. US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East Here are couple excerpts: WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), to data centers in the Middle East. G42, a UAE-based AI company with historic ties to China, has been a focus of those concerns. In April, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), opens new tab announced that it would invest $1.5 billion in the company, with plans to provide G42 with chips and model weights, sophisticated data that improves an AI model's ability to emulate human reasoning.The deal drew scrutiny from China hardliners in Congress, even though G42 said in February that it had divested from China and was accepting constraints imposed on it by the United States to work with American companies. LOL you can't make this up. Literally this just got reported by Reuters today 9/30/2024. This completely aligns with my argument above regarding the UAE-G42. With chips now entering into the Middle East from Nvidia and potentially others I don't know how this startup IPO makes it off the ground. I don't mean to be bearish but I don't think this is the time for them to raise an IPO without showing more progress. I could be wrong. As of now, I don't plan on buying any shares. Instead, I will be adding more shares into Nvidia because now this is bullish news for Nvidia.",0.5441,"['NEGATIVE', 1.0]"

Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year. This report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure. With Nvidia's earnings report on the horizon, AMD's results offer a useful benchmark. Although AMD has significantly underperformed Nvidia year-to-date, this could be an opportunity to turn the tables. Data Center Growth is Key Analysts predict AMD's data center revenue will reach a record $3.52 billion for Q3. In July, CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in strong revenue growth for the year's second half, driven by demand for Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. Earlier this month, AMD launched its latest data center AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, and investors are keen to see its performance. Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari pointed to sustained growth in AI infrastructure capital expenditure, a recovery in server CPUs, and AMD's ongoing market share gains.

Bloomberg Again Reports on Semiconductors With Flimsy Information on Secret Government Contacts.csv,"Usually, when things that are leaked with an intention the entity where the leak comes from is pleased with said leak. Not for Bloomberg though. Bloomberg actually accomplishes citing an anonymous source about on ongoing discussions related to chip distribution and subsequently takes that information to the White House National Security Council to ask them to comment. Here is the WHNSC's response. Bloomberg: US Weighs Capping Exports of AI Chips From Nvidia and AMD to Some Countries A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the talks but pointed to a recent joint statement by the US and UAE on artificial intelligence. In it, the two countries acknowledged the “tremendous potential of AI for good,” as well as the “challenges and risks of this emerging technology and the vital importance of safeguards.” The council responds with a no comment while directing them to a positive statement. To me, this greatly diminishes whomever the Bloomberg contact is. This is the second time that Bloomberg goes out of their way citing a leaky government source that on it's own merits isn't really that sensational at all. The headline is sensational the reality is not. The approach would set a ceiling on export licenses for certain countries in the interest of national security, according to the people, who described the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Officials are focused on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing appetite for AI data centers and the deep pockets to fund them, the people said. This isn't even news. Reuters reported on this a month ago with a much more neutral to positive tone. Which it is. Reuters: US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia to data centers in the Middle East.Since October 2023, U.S. exporters have been required to obtain licenses before shipping advanced chips to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.Under the new rule, data centers will be able to apply for Validated End User status that will allow them to receive chips under a general authorization, rather than requiring their U.S. suppliers to obtain individual licenses to ship to them. If you're tracking, this simply seems to be the 2nd half of that original conversation. There are already chip restrictions. Nvidia is already not delivering the most advanced chips to those countries. The framework proposed would allow Nvidia to deliver chips under certain restrictions and guidelines. Bloomberg acknowledges this towards the tail end of the article. While officials have debated the best approach, they’ve slowed high-volume AI chip license approvals to the Middle East and elsewhere. But there are signs things could get moving soon: Under the new rules for shipments to data centers, US officials will vet and preapprove specific customers based on security commitments from both the companies and their national governments, paving the way for easier licensing down the road. What I don't understand is why does Bloomberg like to make things salacious when they're seemingly not. There is 0 chips to parts of the Middle-East today, but the U.S. government is working on a framework that may relieve that. Reuter story from a month ago. The end.

Luckly, I just came out of a similar trade on B.Riley and kinda figured if those frauds can get away with not filing financials on time for over 180 days and they are still trading, there is no way SMCI will get delisted. I buy 250 $34.5 strike weekly calls on SMCI at $0.50 a pop. That’s a ~$12,500, baby position babbyyy. Why $34.5 calls? idk whats funnier than $34? $34.5. Also I looked at where it dropped when EY announced they wouldn't proceed as their auditors amd $34.5 is about the level they closed at that day. Finally, $34.5 is within my personal risk tolerance. guh Today, I’m minding my own business, scrolling Reddit, eating a sandwich, watching Ana De Armas AI Porn, minding my own business. My phone buzzes, and it’s my buddy. This guy texts me out of nowhere, “Man, I think I’m fucked. I sold $34.5 naked calls on SMCI this week. Thought it’d be easy money.” So I’m like, waiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.. I check my broker app and look at the open interest on these contracts, and my jaw hits the goddamn floor. The open interest is 257. lol. 257 contracts, and your boy here owns 250 of them. I’m the goddamn other side of his trade! I'm the guy that said yuuuuuuuuuup I'll take those off your hands sir. If everything holds up and SMCI opens strong tomorrow, this guy is about to be bent over a financial barrel, down 500% at open (das what the app is saying rn at least). He thought he was playing it safe, slinging naked calls like he’s DFV or something, and now he’s unknowingly writing me a fat f***ing check for $62,000 (so far). He knows I bought SMCI calls. I mentioned it in passing, like, “Yeah, I’m in on SMCI this week.” But he doesn’t know how many or what strike. I didn’t tell him I went full-blown degenerate with $12.5K on a strike so far out of the money. Now I’m sitting here, “Do I tell him?” Like, “Hey bro, funny story, you’re about to owe me your next three paychecks because I’m holding all the cards—and by cards, I mean your fuckiing calls.” Or do I keep my mouth shut and let the market gods do what they do? I feel bad, but not that bad, you know? Trading is a tough game isn't it? No mercy. So that’s where I'm going to hold a little past open and then I’m cashing in big-time, and he’s gonna be selling plasma to cover his losses. What would you guys do?

I wait all year for this opportunity - now I'm going to share it with you.csv,"If you trade long enough, you begin to see patterns emerge. On October 30th, one of my favorite patterns is starting. If you buy AMD stock on the last Monday of October, the average return for the rest of the year is 24.52%, and the stock is higher 88.89% of the time. This data starts in 2015 because it is the first full year after Dr. Lisa Su became CEO of AMD. Some of you may be wondering why this period is so strong for AMD stock. Let me share my personal theory. AMD depends on TSMC for chip manufacturing. Taiwan is protected by its geography and weather, but the Chinese have two windows of opportunity to cross the Strait with favorable weather. The first is from late March to the end of April. The second is from late September to late October. Last year, China launched major military exercises around Taiwan in April. This year, they did it in October, which just ended a few days ago. (They also launch these exercises when they are provoked, such as when Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan or during the recent Taiwanese elections.) In my view, the end of October triggers a relief rally in stocks related to TSMC, most notably AMD and Nvidia. This combines with earnings and strong seasonality, resulting in massive outperformance in a relatively short period of time. A quick word of warning—this time period includes earnings. If you want to avoid earnings risk, you can wait until the first Monday of November. If you wait until November, the average return is 19.06%, and the stock is higher 77.78% of the time by the end of the year.

Intel is a good buy.csv,"We are all well aware Intel is having it's own Boeing moment right now with design flaws in their CPUs and horrible customer service. They deserve the steaming pile dooky that is currently sitting atop their share value. That being said, they have an ace that may flip the entire market on it's head: They own their fabs. That's right: all the other big boys in town design and give their blueprints for TSMC to manufacture. That's true of AMD, Nvidia, and other ARM and mobile chip designers. Intel is the only large scale chip designers that is more or less vertically integrated. As you may know, they just got $8.8B from papa Biden to build more foundries in Ohio and Arizona, in addition to their other sites across the world. None of this is particularly noteworthy until you consider that China has always been very interested in Chinesing Taiwan, and are even more so now that they have been embargoed from Nvidia chips by the US. The Chinese military build-up over the past decade has focused heavily on amphibious warfare, and long range anti-naval weapons (think carrier buster ballistic/boost-glide stand off weapons.) It doesn't take a Ph.D in geopolitics to understand what the move is here. On the US/allied side, the discourse around Taiwan has slowly shifted: what started out as ""we have overwhelming force and we will stop any attempt at an invasion of Taiwan"" has become something like ""Maybe we can't stop them from invading, but we can make it a Pyrrhic victory"". This may actually be the case, but the trend is not great. You will have noticed Taiwan has been increasingly politically isolated, mirroring the growing Chinese military power in the region. So what happens to TSMC if Taiwan gets Chinesed? As you can imagine, China is interested in acquiring as many TSMC assets and personnel intact as possible. This means you can bet your degenerate bacon that US intelligence services have contingencies to extradite key scientists and engineers, and scuttle the production plants and machines before the Chinese can take control of them. But the result is easy to predict: no more TSMC. This means the personnel extradited will be used to advise and run US production plants owned by, you guessed it: Intel. Intel will have a quasi monopoly on chip manufacturing. The US government see this of course, that's why they are strongly nudging Nvidia to play nice with Intel, because they see a potential future where Intel is the only player in town capable of making Nvidia chips, or any consumer chips at all for that matter, in the West.

Intel is a pretty safe bet and are undervalued.csv,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs. An additional benefit is that Intel can leverage their fabs in order to achieve higher margins for their own products. It's possible Intel's stock could be hit again in a month or so when their report comes out, but they are likely already at bottom.",0.5493,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9999]"

Is INTC undervalued .csv,"Valuation Analysis of Intel Corporation Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has long been a key player in the semiconductor industry, but recent market developments and the rise of competitors like AMD and Nvidia have caused its stock to significantly underperform relative to its peers. As of Q2 2024, Intel’s total assets amount to approximately $182 billion, with liabilities around $91 billion, resulting in a net asset value of $91 billion. Yet, its market capitalization is around $95 billion, reflecting an almost 1:1 ratio between market cap and net assets. In contrast, competitors such as AMD and Nvidia trade at significantly higher premiums, indicating that the market may be underpricing Intel’s growth potential. Company Market Cap (Billion $) Net Assets (Billion $) Price to Net Asset Ratio Intel 95 91 1.04 AMD 266 56.5 4.71 Nvidia 3,000 58.15 51.58 Understanding Intel’s Valuation The Price to Net Asset Ratio (P/NAV) is a critical measure of how the market values a company relative to its net assets. Intel's current P/NAV of 1.04 reveals that its market value is nearly identical to its net assets, a valuation that appears surprisingly low, particularly when compared to its competitors. AMD and Nvidia, for instance, demonstrate P/NAV ratios of 4.71 and 51.58, respectively. This significant gap highlights the possibility that Intel is undervalued, especially given its strong fundamentals and growth potential. Several factors support this assessment. Despite facing fierce competition, Intel remains a leader in the semiconductor industry, known for its quality and innovation. The company is making substantial investments in new technologies and manufacturing capabilities, positioning itself to capitalize on growing trends such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, Intel boasts a robust balance sheet, with total assets of about $182 billion and liabilities around $91 billion. This financial strength provides a solid foundation for future growth and strategic initiatives. Although the recent decision to lay off 15,000 employees might seem concerning, it is part of a broader strategy to enhance operational efficiency and focus on core competencies, enabling Intel to adapt more effectively to evolving market demands. A key factor influencing Intel's future is the increasing global demand for semiconductors. As technology becomes more integrated into daily life, the need for high-performance chips continues to rise. Intel's resources and commitment to innovation position it to capture a larger share of this expanding market. Moreover, government support for the semiconductor industry adds another layer of potential upside for Intel. Given the strategic importance of semiconductor manufacturing in light of global supply chain challenges, particularly concerning the Taiwan-China situation, there is growing interest from government entities to bolster domestic semiconductor production. This focus on strengthening local supply chains can create favorable conditions for Intel, as it could receive both financial incentives and regulatory support to expand its operations and enhance its competitive positioning. Conclusion In summary, Intel Corporation is significantly undervalued based on its current P/NAV ratio. The company possesses strong assets, a history of innovation, and a strategic focus on future technologies. As Intel continues to execute its strategic plans and navigate market challenges, it has substantial potential to regain its competitive edge and achieve remarkable growth. Furthermore, the increasing government interest in supporting semiconductor manufacturing amid geopolitical uncertainties enhances Intel's prospects. The market's current valuation does not adequately reflect Intel's true value and growth potential, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

Long-time AMD Holder (Cost Basis 1904) Starting to Sell - Anyone Else Disappointed in the Stock in 2.csv,"Wrote about my thinking below... Out of the 31 large banks, 25 have a “buy” rating and 6 have a “hold” rating on AMD 0.29%↑. It’s hard to think about why to sell when everyone is telling you to buy, but I am of the opinion that is when it should be most deeply considered. image credit to tipranks.com AMD has been my most profitable investment of the past 5 years, having risen 800% since purchased in August of 2018. For most investors (including myself), it’s difficult to part with winners. Not only that, I am someone who believes AI will proliferate throughout society in the coming years. Because they design data center GPUs, AMD should be one of the primary beneficiaries as the AI boom continues. It might seem counter-intuitive then to sell the stock here, but that is what I’ve begun doing over the past two weeks. I had high hopes for AMD this year, but it’s my view that they've failed to take significant data center GPU market share from Nvidia, and will have increased competition from Intel's new product offerings (on both client and data center), as well as proprietary silicon from large cloud players (Google, Amazon, etc). My original thesis was that AMD would profit from overextended Nvidia margins in 2024, but this underestimated the CUDA ecosystem moat that existed with Nvidia data center products (see Why I Got Nvidia Wrong). While most large cloud players want to diversify at least somewhat from Nvidia, they are still unable to do so without risking a competitive advantage with their own AI offerings. Add Intel into the mix, and the margin and market share pressure will be on AMD. The only player in the silicon value chain I think which can currently raise margins is TSMC (TSM 2.61%↑), but the geopolitical risk is too high for me to continue holding the stock (I sold my TSMC stake two weeks ago). On the PC (personal computer), Nvidia has always had a strong moat. It’s not just because they have the best performing products, but also because game developers are economically incentivized to optimize first (and often only) for the largest potential audience. This is similar to the moat CUDA protects on the data center side. One might think that Nvidia charging incredibly high prices for discrete graphics cards would cause them to lose share to AMD with consumers who directly purchase the products (as opposed to businesses who purchase the data center products). Yet Nvidia market share has only grown over the past few years. Data from Jon Peddie Research Why This Take Could Be Wrong: There is a lot of bullish momentum in the investor community around AMD currently from both professional commentators and retail investors (e.g. Twitter / X). Many people who had never heard of AMD 5 years ago are now saying to put money into the stock as it is Nvidia’s only pure AI competitor. As a result of this, AMD could see a dramatic rise on a positive earnings report later this month. In addition, I expect gaming revenues to surprise to the upside with the minor refresh of Xbox and Playstation consoles coming for holiday season. I still have ~260 shares of AMD remaining, and will likely hold to see if the stock jumps on the report. I think that AMD is extremely stretched in its current valuation (P/E of 205), and that any bad news could send it spiralling. Selling half of the remaining stake now is essentially a hedge against this possibility. Whatever happens with the earnings report, I will likely reduce my AMD holdings to zero in the next few months as I continue to lower exposure to companies reliant on Taiwan.",0.5591,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9976]"

Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about. And as far as I know, Biden or Trump won't block sales of regular computer pc windows chips to China or anywhere else for that matter. :) Imagine being the king of accelerated compute and now you have a cpu + gpu combo ARM chip that runs silent like Apple M chips and sips low power like such, but games and does AI and any heavy compute intense task very wicked like, very retail level computer chip level like that is specifically from the box ready to work with cuda and marry with existing nvidia gpu's at the hyperscaler level to even more efficiently run AI intense software and on prem (on the laptop or pc itself without cloud compute help, like QCOM snapdragon Elite PC boasts it can do(but sucks, incompatible with lots of software and games, not so with nvda).

"NVDA will hit 5T market cap in 2026, and 10T market cap before 2032.csv","Hi regards, This is not a ""copium"" post about the recent stock price drops. I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest. The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY. First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"". Name Stock price EPS SP/EPS ratio AAPL 230 1,4 164 MSFT 413 2,95 140 AMD 145 0,16 1.035 META 516 5,16 100 AMZN 171 1,26 135 NVDA 116 0,68 170 As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price. But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list. AAPL Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits. How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new. But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more. MSFT They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are. They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy. They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office? AMD I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first. Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware. Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software. And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section. META They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value. ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS. AMZN The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL. NVDA AND OUR STAR CHILD. HOT TOPIC OF 2024. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company. Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich? Let the bears win some battles, so NVDA can win the war. EDIT: forgor some words",0.5499,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9999]"
NVIDIA (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang Points to 1 Trillion Opportunity for the Company.csv,"Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the next few weeks until the US election would be “confusing” for many since no one could say anything with conviction about who is going to be in the White House. Lee said that the market is going to trade “well” into the upcoming Fed meeting where he expects “some” rate cuts amid the labor market needing support and positive inflation data. Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said: However, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive. For this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that a trillion dollars’ worth of general-purpose data centers will inevitably transition to accelerated computing. “We’re in a computer revolution,” Huang said, pointing out that the first wave of data center modernization is driven by generative AI, which he described as more than just a tool—it’s a skill. Huang also emphasized the need for “densification,” with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) aiming to make data centers more efficient by compressing them into smaller spaces. He discussed NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it. Nvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia. Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave. At Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range. Of course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector. Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: Overall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings.

NVIDIA’s next catalyst has to be sovereign AI.csv,"NVIDIA’s current valuation is not overtly expensive (FPER: 33, PEG: 1.61 according to FINVIZ) and the GPU orders for next year are all booked. Yet the stock is meeting strong resistance around $130. I think this is partially because a lot of people have been burned by CISCO during dot-com bubble and do not want to price in the future too much. But the real concern is that their revenue is almost entirely dependent on the rest of M7 and they are charging the big tech 80 % margin. The big tech, while being hammered by Wall Street for the increased CAPEX spending, indicated during last earning that they will not reduce their investment on AI. However, they did mention that they are/plan using their NPU (Google TPU, Tesla Dojo, AMD) to reduce the usage of NVIDIA GPU. Furthermore, GPT5 and Apple Intelligence should be available to the public by the end of this year. If these do not impress, the entire AI sector may see significant slowdown. But if GPT5 shows plateauing of performance while people find Apple Intelligence interesting, paradigm could shift toward smaller models and inference efficiency, again reducing the demand for NVIDIA. To justify significant increase in NVIDIA’s stock price, they need to show that they are not entirely dependent on the Big Tech. The only other potential buyers that have as much buying power are governments. Also, if the economy is going through downturns, governments have excuse to increase their spending. What I am paying attention to during the earning call is demonstration from NVIDIA that they are receiving significant demand from non-Big Tech such as governments.",0.5529,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9994]"

Strong AI and Semiconductor weeks ahead.csv,"Hi all, I think that AI and esp. Semiconductor Stocks have a couple of strong weeks ahead. Starting on Tuesday, October 15th 2024, the Open Compute Project (OCP) global summit takes place in San Jose, California. Between 9 AM and 11:30 AM there'll be short keynotes (each 12 mins) presented by Meta, NVidia, AI Clusters, Intel, AMD, Microsoft and Google (full schedule here). Now, I don't think that there'll be any big surprises. But the Summit still presents an opportunity for public remarks about how strong the demand is or what so ever. Also, there's an article that says that Broadcom (AVGO) is going to show case cutting-edge AI infrastructure. Further it is expected that Taiwan Semiconductor Company (TSM) and ASML Holding (ASML) will publish their Q3 earnings next week. TSM will present its earnings on October 17th 2024 at 14:00 Taiwan time / 02:00 Eastern Time. So pre-market movements will most likely be wild on Thursday as a large part of the industry relies on TSM. If TSM reports a great Q3 revenue, this could push Nvidia over the current all time high. Also according to Moore's law is dead, the first RTX 5000 series GPUs are ready to be sold, but are not released because of business reasons (here at 22:22). So they could still change their mind and ship in Q4. Next, it is rumored (by moore's law is dead) that AMD will release a new CPU by the end of October or early November, the 9800X3D which is an 8 Core Gaming CPU with 3D cache and it is expected that it will be the fastest gaming CPU releasing this year. Although Client is not as important for AMD, it will still be beneficial to have this CPU released before the holiday season. Especially since Zen5 Rysen has so far been viewed as rather disappointing. Moore's law is dead also mentions an RX 7650 GRE GPU, which could launch alongside Ryzen 9800X3D. Releasing a slightly refreshed and cheap RDNA3 GPU could be a good move by AMD to get rid of RDNA3 stock ahead of the RDNA4 launch in 2025. Since the Ryzen 9800X3D has not yet been anounced, I don't think that it has been priced in and could give the stock a slight boost to recover from the -4% last Thursday. Also, I although Investors were not excited about AMDs Advancing AI event, I think AMDs position in the market is still solid. According to the slides shown at the event, AMD Epic has increased its market share to 34%. And according to tests AMD Epyc Turin obliterates Xeon 6 Granite Rapids, while being cheaper. Because of this, I think AMD is in a good position to gain more server market share. Further, the news about Nvidia Blackwell being sold out for the next 12 Months is not only good news for Nvidia but also for AMD. Sure, everyone wants blackwell. but if one can't get blackwell and if AMD Instinct MI325X is faster than Nvidia Hopper (H200), then they might be able to win over customers from nvidia, who would like to buy blackwell but can't in due time. Also, AMDs earnings should be reported on October 29 2024. Due to Ryzen Zen5 being disappointing and there being apparently a large RDNA3 stock remaining. If AMDs Instinct systems are selling well, this would also be good news for Micron Industries (MU), which produces high bandwith memory (HBM3e). And then there's Intel. Their newest releases seem to have been disappointing. But they claim to be making progress with their foundries.

For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong. $AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice. $NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were. And so in true wsb fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB. There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long. From a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about. And so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry : If you are under 40 years old, $HOOD (Finance), $PLTR (Defense) and $DKNG (gambling) will 100x during your investment horizon.

JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon also stated that a U.S. recession is the most likely scenario, with the chance of a soft landing being between 35% and 40%!

"Weekly jobless claims fall to 233,000, less than expected, in a positive sign for labor market.csv","Last night, the U.S. announced that the number of initial unemployment claims for last week was 233,000, significantly lower than the previous week's 249,000 and also below the market's expectation of 240,000! A few days ago, Mr. Wang mentioned that for the U.S. stock market to stop declining, the economic and labor data released must continue to be strong in order to ease concerns about a potential economic recession. Yesterday's sharp drop in initial unemployment claims marked the largest decrease in a year, indicating that the number of people recently unemployed has decreased. This alleviated the recession concerns raised by last Friday's non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate data, spurring a rally in U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 index surging over 2.3%, the largest single-day gain in 21 months 📈. On the other hand, the demand for the 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds at the auctions over the past two days was poor, causing the 10-year yield to exceed 4% once again! Tech giants saw a broad rebound, with Meta rising 4.2%, Alphabet up 1.9%, Amazon gaining 1.8%, Apple increasing 1.6%, and Microsoft rebounding 1%. Nvidia surged over 6%, returning to the $100 mark, leading to a rebound in semiconductor stocks. Broadcom, Micron, and Applied Materials all jumped more than 6%, while Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and AMD all saw gains of over 5%! Taiwan's ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) also rebounded, with TSMC and UMC both jumping more than 6%, and ASE gaining over 4%. However, it's still important to note that the number of continuing unemployment claims is rising, reaching its highest level since November 2021, nearly three years ago! Therefore, Wall Street's foreign investors remain concerned about the economy. For example, JPMorgan still believes the U.S. economy will enter a recession, raising the probability from 25% to 35%!

"Why I think Intel is a Misunderstood, Undervalued Play – A Bet on 18A (+EV DD).csv","Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.",0.5307,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9997]"

I don't do options so maybe this is the wrong place lmao. I moved back home to my parents place when my dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Truthfully this has been the worst year of my life (and his obviously) in a lot of ways, but I've been investing since I was 16 (I'm 25 now). My dad worked in equities, so when he lost his ability to communicate effectively with me (and since I had significantly more income because I'm not paying rent) - I truthfully went ballistic on investing. Pretty much said fuck it, I'm living at home I don't need a 6 month emergency fund till I move out and went all-in. Granted 40% of my portfolio not listed here is in a 401k account entirely in the S&P 500 (set & forget just in case my equities went to hell as with the rest of my life lol). I believe in the margin of safety when investing. I like to invest in high-quality companies that generate lots of cash as the backbone of my portfolio. Since 2021 (before my dad got this cancer shit), I spoke with him and he basically said just look at the fundamentals of a company and invest in growth companies that you think will be around in 5-10 years. I look for value within growth stocks (i know paradoxical). Some of my icons in investing are David Tepper & Michael Burry. Again below is all my own experience and reflects only my own views and are not a recommendation of my company (corporate. disclaimer). My portfolio is heavily weighted (85%) between several stocks: AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL (So fucking cheap r u kidding me sorry), NVDA, AMZN, AMD, CRM, COST, RIVN (RIP), AVGO, VOO (ik not a stock) <-- I know semi(s) are very cyclical but i believe in holding all of these companies for 5-10 years, so I don't have to worry about temp. earnings beats/misses etc. Much easier to pick a stock and hold it for a while then it is to get the timing right. Roughly at 175% return in the past 3 years. (hammered META at $100's, NVDA at $200 both in 2022) Roughly 15% of my bets are moonshots (note the word bet hehe) with promise but objectively could be overvalued/bad investments: CCL/RCL (both are crushing it and between them own 75% of the cruise line market), LCID/RIVN (going to 0 bc they can't scale profitably or will make u a very happy person 3 years down the line bc R2/Atlas at 45k/50k should capture a significant portion of model y demand), TTD, DKNG/FLUT - gambling hasn't even been legalized in Cali/Texas (the biggest markets in the U.S. come on), RBLX (feels like betting against youtube in the early innings w/o realizing how much rev. they're actually recognizing), PYPL (value - cheap af (bought at $60) should turn around in a couple years) I joke I allocate like google's budget where it's 90% bread&butter and the rest are moonshots. Was very depressed (still reasonably depressed) because I'm not sure how much time my dad has. I hope in a way I can pass some of these stocks to my kid in a better place than I found it.

AI chipmaker Cerebras files for IPO to take on Nvidia - But 87% of its revenues have come from the U.csv,"The Middle East wants chips badly but US restrictions prevent the US most powerful chips entering into certain geographical areas such as China and the Middle East; this entails the UAE. Nevertheless, the UAE wants in on the GPU chips craze and is apparently willing to pay anything to enter into the chip bonanza. The UAE can't get Nvidia's, AMD's, or Intel's best GPU chips so instead they are investing heavily into alternatives such as Cerebras. There is nothing inherently wrong with this but it's also the biggest red flag as an investment opportunity. If the agreements for Nvidia chips open up in the Middle East and specifically with the UAE that could be a crushing blow to this aspiring startup. Specifically, Cerebras Systems reported a net loss of $66.6 million for the first six months of 2024, on $136.4 million in revenue. For the same period in 2023 it has a net loss of $77.8 million on just $8.7 million in sales. 87% of this revenue for the first half of 2024 was directly from the UAE G42. The other red flag from this startup is the way in which they promote their business. It's all seemingly smoke and mirrors and conveniently based on outdated GPU pricing and throughput information; which is very publically available. For some reason, Groq and Cerebras love to keep using memory to unlock speeds on small/tiny models which is impractical and inefficient for a scaled system; or a system that is a large foundational LLM. As well, they have no clue what models will do next so it's a major after the fact architecture that uses llama because they have access to it. https://cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebras-inference-ai-at-instant-speed. A prime example of this is OpenAI's GPT-o1 model that uses reasoning in coordination with its model capabilities. Because they are not being used on the forefront of this technology they don't know how or when a model's size, function, or needs will evolve into the future. All of this plus the pricing from OpenAI and Microsoft is coming down exponentially. For Example: They are referring to a 70b param model that shoves an entire model onto memory. They are going up against h100's which is a very old technology at this point. They make no reference to h200's let alone blackwell Because they are referencing such a small model the pricing model they suggest would be radically different for a 400b param model and forget about trillion param models which are coming next. They're not being truthful about tokens per s. As of today this is Azure GPT 4o and GPT 4 mini tokens per minute gpt-4o & GPT-4 Turbo global standard Model Tier Quota Limit in tokens per minute (TPM) Requests per minute gpt-4o Enterprise agreement 30 M 180 K gpt-4o-mini Enterprise agreement 50 M 300 As you can clearly see 30 million tokens per minute is 500k tokens per second and mini is 833,333 tokens per second. So i don't know why they are referring to 20 tokens per second or their 450 tokens per second seems way off. maybe they mean million. Even if that is the case and 70 b would be more like mini it is way higher than their limit. On pricing which they lay out a 3:1 input versus output is fine the price would be for mini which is a comparable model is roughly .10 cents (input) + .20 cents = .30 cents. Per million. for regular 4o it would be higher and let's face it GPT 4o is a far superior model than llama 3.1 3.33 dollar + 5 = $8.33 Source: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/ From this information what I can tell you is that what we just went over is pricing. it is not some guarantee for what a model produces per second. That shit is very random. What I can tell you is from GPT 4 to GPT 4 turbo to Gpt 4o the speed is dramatically better. GPT 4o mini is damn near real time. Take that for what it's worth. I am not saying they're being dishonest here but I am saying they are being very cheeky with how they advertise things.

This is not a competitor to Nvidia but rather a temporary solution in the Middle East until chip embargoes are alleviated. The media here loves to use sexy headlines on non-technical verifications of what it is they are actually comparing. I.e. H100's are now old, or The fact an entity may need to serve millions of clients... No they are instead reporting self-prompting headlines from Cerebras that say things like our chips are 20x faster than Nvidia. Live Update: As I am writing and researching this topic it has just been reported by Reuters that the U.S. is setting a new rule to allow chip shipments to the Middle East including the UAE which is a boon to Nvidia and Microsoft. US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East Here are couple excerpts: WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), to data centers in the Middle East. G42, a UAE-based AI company with historic ties to China, has been a focus of those concerns. In April, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), opens new tab announced that it would invest $1.5 billion in the company, with plans to provide G42 with chips and model weights, sophisticated data that improves an AI model's ability to emulate human reasoning.The deal drew scrutiny from China hardliners in Congress, even though G42 said in February that it had divested from China and was accepting constraints imposed on it by the United States to work with American companies. LOL you can't make this up. Literally this just got reported by Reuters today 9/30/2024. This completely aligns with my argument above regarding the UAE-G42. With chips now entering into the Middle East from Nvidia and potentially others I don't know how this startup IPO makes it off the ground. I don't mean to be bearish but I don't think this is the time for them to raise an IPO without showing more progress. I could be wrong. As of now, I don't plan on buying any shares. Instead, I will be adding more shares into Nvidia because now this is bullish news for Nvidia.",0.5441,"['NEGATIVE', 1.0]"

AMD CEO Lisa Su Says AI Is In Early Stages Of Multiyear 'Supercycle' 'There's Tremendous Need For Mo.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) shares are experiencing an upward trend after the company reported strong second-quarter financial results. Following the announcement, CEO Lisa Su emphasized that the chipmaker’s performance is being driven by a multiyear AI “supercycle.” What To Know: Recently, chip stocks saw a sell-off as earnings season approached, with investors questioning the timeline for significant returns on the massive investments in AI. This led to speculation that spending on AI might slow down. However, early earnings reports indicate that capital expenditures have remained robust. Su’s comments on CNBC’s “Squawk On The Street” Wednesday provide reassurance against slowdown concerns. She stated, “From the conversations that I have with our customer set and sort of the broader industry, we can see that AI is a multiyear, you know, I would call it a supercycle frankly. There’s tremendous need for more compute.” AMD reported second-quarter revenue of $5.835 billion and adjusted earnings of 69 cents per share, surpassing analyst estimates as its AI business continues to see accelerating demand. The chipmaker also updated its forecast, expecting GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion this year, up from the previous forecast of more than $4 billion. Su highlighted that analysts and investors are “hypersensitive” to minor quarter-over-quarter changes. She believes that the AI story should be viewed in a broader context, suggesting that the demand is extraordinarily high. “I wouldn’t be hypersensitive in those areas ... Are more customers using it? Is every enterprise asking for it? Are we seeing more applications on a daily, weekly, monthly basis? The answer to that is absolutely yes,” she said. “Everywhere I go, everyone wants to talk about how can we incorporate AI into our businesses faster and more efficiently ... this early in the cycle, there’s a lot of learning and experimentation, but definitely, there will be the return on the investment on the other side,” Su added. Although the return on investment isn’t “instantaneous,” it’s occurring very quickly. AI is already boosting productivity and enabling companies to bring better products to market faster. Su emphasized, “We’re investing today for the return in a couple of years, and I think that’s absolutely the right thing to do. That’s the way to think about these investment cycles.” AMD’s strategic focus on AI and its strong financial performance underscore its robust position in the rapidly evolving technology landscape, highlighting the company’s potential for sustained growth in the coming years.",0.5537,"['NEGATIVE', 0.8673]"

"AMD Q3 Preview EPS Jumps 30% YoY, Close Gap with Nvidia.csv","AMD will release its Q3 earnings report on October 29th, after the U.S. markets close. Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year. This report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure. With Nvidia's earnings report on the horizon, AMD's results offer a useful benchmark. Although AMD has significantly underperformed Nvidia year-to-date, this could be an opportunity to turn the tables. Data Center Growth is Key Analysts predict AMD's data center revenue will reach a record $3.52 billion for Q3. In July, CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in strong revenue growth for the year's second half, driven by demand for Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. Earlier this month, AMD launched its latest data center AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, and investors are keen to see its performance. Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari pointed to sustained growth in AI infrastructure capital expenditure, a recovery in server CPUs, and AMD's ongoing market share gains.

"Apple reportedly seeks to lock out its competitors from TSMC's 2nm process, by booking all of its ma.csv","Apple has long been cozy with TSMC, the manufacturer of the chips that end up in ever-popular iPhone, iPad and Mac products. When you've got as much cash on hand as Apple does, it puts it in a favorable position to negotiate deals with the Taiwan-based chipmaker. Now it is reportedly seeking to lock in 100% of TSMC's bleeding edge 2nm production capacity, giving it a competitive advantage when products eventually make their way to the market. According to 9to5mac (via Extreme tech), Apple's chief operating officer met with TSMC bosses to negotiate terms to secure 2nm capacity. The report cites 'local sources', so there needs to be a pinch of salt here, but given Apple's track record of locking up TSMC's capacity, this would certainly come as no surprise. TSMC's 2nm process is currently scheduled to enter risk production in 2025, with volume production set for the second half of 2025. That means the upcoming iPhone 16 family with A18 chips will stick with 3nm, but it could mean the high end iPhone 17 Pro and Max could be the first in line to be built with 2nm technology. The specifics of deals between TSMC and its customers are obviously not made public, but it is widely accepted that Apple booked all of TSMC's 3nm capacity, at least for a period of time. These chips, including the A17 and M3 families made their way into the latest generation iPhone 15 Pros and MacBooks. That would make Apple's 2nm play unsurprising. It's easy to see why Apple would attempt to secure the maximum amount of 2nm capacity. It will give it an advantage over its competitors, as 2nm chips will allow Apple to pack in more transistors into a given area, leading to better performance or lower power consumption—if not both. Samsung has its own manufacturing capacity, and future Exynos chips will be built in-house, but 2nm Snapdragon and possibly Google Tensor chips may have to wait in line behind Apple. Even mega-companies such as Google and Qualcomm don't have the cash on hand to outbid big daddy Apple. It's not just Arm competitors that will be disadvantaged. Nvidia will want every possible power and performance advantage it can get as it dominates the market for AI processors, while AMD will also have to wait for access to the best nodes. Even Intel could find itself at a disadvantage given some of the tiles for its chips are manufactured by TSMC.

Bloomberg Again Reports on Semiconductors With Flimsy Information on Secret Government Contacts.csv,"Usually, when things that are leaked with an intention the entity where the leak comes from is pleased with said leak. Not for Bloomberg though. Bloomberg actually accomplishes citing an anonymous source about on ongoing discussions related to chip distribution and subsequently takes that information to the White House National Security Council to ask them to comment. Here is the WHNSC's response. Bloomberg: US Weighs Capping Exports of AI Chips From Nvidia and AMD to Some Countries A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the talks but pointed to a recent joint statement by the US and UAE on artificial intelligence. In it, the two countries acknowledged the “tremendous potential of AI for good,” as well as the “challenges and risks of this emerging technology and the vital importance of safeguards.” The council responds with a no comment while directing them to a positive statement. To me, this greatly diminishes whomever the Bloomberg contact is. This is the second time that Bloomberg goes out of their way citing a leaky government source that on it's own merits isn't really that sensational at all. The headline is sensational the reality is not. The approach would set a ceiling on export licenses for certain countries in the interest of national security, according to the people, who described the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Officials are focused on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing appetite for AI data centers and the deep pockets to fund them, the people said. This isn't even news. Reuters reported on this a month ago with a much more neutral to positive tone. Which it is. Reuters: US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia to data centers in the Middle East.Since October 2023, U.S. exporters have been required to obtain licenses before shipping advanced chips to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.Under the new rule, data centers will be able to apply for Validated End User status that will allow them to receive chips under a general authorization, rather than requiring their U.S. suppliers to obtain individual licenses to ship to them. If you're tracking, this simply seems to be the 2nd half of that original conversation. There are already chip restrictions. Nvidia is already not delivering the most advanced chips to those countries. The framework proposed would allow Nvidia to deliver chips under certain restrictions and guidelines. Bloomberg acknowledges this towards the tail end of the article. While officials have debated the best approach, they’ve slowed high-volume AI chip license approvals to the Middle East and elsewhere. But there are signs things could get moving soon: Under the new rules for shipments to data centers, US officials will vet and preapprove specific customers based on security commitments from both the companies and their national governments, paving the way for easier licensing down the road. What I don't understand is why does Bloomberg like to make things salacious when they're seemingly not. There is 0 chips to parts of the Middle-East today, but the U.S. government is working on a framework that may relieve that. Reuter story from a month ago. The end.

Could PLTR go on a TSLA-like Run (70%) if Included in SP500.csv,"On June 7th, S&P 500 is set to rebalance and Palantir will be eligible for the third time. With the spotlight on AI and Palantir's continued strong performance, there's a very high likelihood it is included in the S&P, which could lead PLTR going on a Tesla-like run. First, let me break down why Palantir is a great candidate for inclusion. Inclusion in the S&P 500 index involves meeting several stringent criteria related to market capitalization, liquidity, financial viability, and corporate governance. For Palantir Technologies (PLTR) to be considered a good candidate for S&P 500 inclusion, it must satisfy these key requirements: Market Capitalization: A company must have a market cap of at least $14.6 billion (as of 2023). Palantir's market capitalization has been above this threshold for a while. Liquidity: Companies need to have adequate liquidity, with a high trading volume. Palantir's shares are actively traded, reflecting strong investor interest and sufficient liquidity. Financial Viability: The company must report positive earnings in the most recent quarter and over the last four quarters combined. Palantir has demonstrated profitability, reporting positive GAAP EPS in recent quarters (InvestorPlace). U.S. Based: Companies must be U.S.-based, with the majority of their assets and revenues derived from the U.S. Palantir fits this criterion, being headquartered in Denver, Colorado, and deriving significant revenue from U.S. operations. Public Float: At least 50% of a company's shares must be in the public float. Palantir's public float percentage is adequate to meet this requirement, with substantial institutional ownership indicating wide distribution among public shareholders Palantir meets all the eligibility criteria, the only which could be a problem is corporate governance, ie, the insiders own a lot of shares of the company; however there are tons of examples of other companies that have a similar structure. As many of you know, Tesla went on a 70% in the weeks leading up to and the month following its inclusion. However, it's not alone. Many other ""sexy/high-profile"" names go on epic runs when SP500 inclusion is announced. Twitter (TWTR) Inclusion Date: June 7, 2018 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $26 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on May 21, 2018, Twitter's stock increased by approximately 14%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, Twitter's stock increased by about 5%. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2019 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2019, NXP's stock rose by approximately 10%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, NXP's stock increased by around 6%. AMD (Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.) (AMD) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2017 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $20 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2017, AMD's stock increased by approximately 12%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, AMD's stock rose by around 9%. T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS) Inclusion Date: June 22, 2020 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on June 5, 2020, T-Mobile's stock increased by approximately 8%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, T-Mobile's stock saw an increase of about 7%. NVIDIA (NVDA) Inclusion Date: November 18, 2001 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $25 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: NVIDIA's stock saw a significant rise, roughly around 20-25%, in the weeks leading up to the inclusion. Month Following Inclusion: The stock continued to perform well, with an additional increase of around 10-15%. ""S&P 500 effect,"" is a real phenomenon and I think it's even more powerful with high-profile names like Palantir. As mentioned earlier, Tesla went on a god-like run in the weeks leading up to and after the announcement. And I think Palantir shares many characteristics with Tesla that may see it go on a similar run. Both companies have a very high-profile CEO. Alex Karp is loved by Palantir holders just like Elon is by Tesla fanboys, which leads to my most important point: retail ownership. Palantir has a significant amount of its shares outstanding owned by retail; if SP500 inclusion is announced and institutions have to buy shares it may create a similar move like Tesla's as most palantir fanboys won't sell. Like Tesla, they believe Palantir is changing the world (look at their subreddit). I think buying Palantir options is a great upside play with limited downside, depending on when you purchase your options. The inclusion announcement is on Friday after hours, so you could buy Friday before close or anytime this week and sell Monday morning if its not included for a minimum loss. And with options being so cheap, this could be a 50-bagger if it goes to 30 bucks. 6/21 23 C 6/21 25 C.",0.5557,"['POSITIVE', 0.7174]"

How Terrifying is the Start of August.csv,"Just over the past three trading days, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 indices have all recorded their largest three-day cumulative decline since June 2022! Last night, the Nasdaq plummeted by over 6% at one point, and the S&P 500 dropped by more than 4%, with both indices returning to their early May levels by the close of trading. Although the major U.S. indices and individual stocks still closed with significant losses, the intraday declines were somewhat moderated. The primary reason for this was the release of the U.S. July ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, which rebounded from a four-year low in June to 51.4, exceeding market expectations and returning to the expansion zone above 50! Sub-indices, including the New Orders Index and Employment Index, also showed growth. Notably, the Employment Index reached 51.1, marking the largest increase since September of last year and the first time this year that it has entered the expansion zone above 50. This data slightly alleviated fears from last week's significant non-farm payroll decline, making the market believe that the drop in new jobs was primarily due to Hurricane Barry hitting Texas. 👉 As discussed previously, the sharp decline in U.S. stocks at the start of August stemmed from worries about the U.S. economy falling into recession. Therefore, when the ISM Non-Manufacturing number showed growth yesterday, it somewhat restored market confidence in the economy, helping to narrow the intraday losses of U.S. stocks. The U.S. stock market now needs to see positive economic growth news to recover, unlike before when everyone was hoping for bad news, anticipating a Federal Reserve interest rate cut! Hence, it is crucial to continue monitoring other economic data. If strong and robust growth numbers do not consistently appear, investors will remain concerned about an economic recession, and the trend of selling stocks for cash will not end.

I wait all year for this opportunity - now I'm going to share it with you.csv,"If you trade long enough, you begin to see patterns emerge. On October 30th, one of my favorite patterns is starting. If you buy AMD stock on the last Monday of October, the average return for the rest of the year is 24.52%, and the stock is higher 88.89% of the time. This data starts in 2015 because it is the first full year after Dr. Lisa Su became CEO of AMD. Some of you may be wondering why this period is so strong for AMD stock. Let me share my personal theory. AMD depends on TSMC for chip manufacturing. Taiwan is protected by its geography and weather, but the Chinese have two windows of opportunity to cross the Strait with favorable weather. The first is from late March to the end of April. The second is from late September to late October. Last year, China launched major military exercises around Taiwan in April. This year, they did it in October, which just ended a few days ago. (They also launch these exercises when they are provoked, such as when Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan or during the recent Taiwanese elections.) In my view, the end of October triggers a relief rally in stocks related to TSMC, most notably AMD and Nvidia. This combines with earnings and strong seasonality, resulting in massive outperformance in a relatively short period of time. A quick word of warning—this time period includes earnings. If you want to avoid earnings risk, you can wait until the first Monday of November. If you wait until November, the average return is 19.06%, and the stock is higher 77.78% of the time by the end of the year. Here is a quick comparison I do all this shit manually so I apologize if there is an error in one of my calculations. My positions: Long 1000 shares with a cost basis of $157.90.

Your best case scenario still loses you money. Intel bullish scenario is 18A, High-Na EUV paying dividends, early experience granting them a year technological lead over TSMC. It doesn't have to work, but the upside is a 10x from these levels. TSMC pass up High NA EUV is repeating the same decision Intel did in 2012 when Intel controlled the market and did not view EUV as economically feasible.

INTC and AMD.csv,"Thesis: AMD ($AMD) and Intel ($INTC) are Undervalued Stocks In the dynamic and highly competitive semiconductor industry, AMD ($AMD) and Intel ($INTC) have demonstrated remarkable resilience, innovation, and market presence. Despite their solid fundamentals, both companies appear undervalued when considering their current market prices relative to their intrinsic value, future growth potential, and industry positioning. This thesis will explore the reasons behind this undervaluation, focusing on financial performance, strategic initiatives, market trends, and competitive advantages. Financial Performance and Valuation Metrics Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratios: Both AMD and Intel have P/E ratios that are below the industry average, suggesting that the market has not fully recognized their earnings potential. AMD's forward P/E ratio is around 25, while Intel's is approximately 12, compared to the semiconductor industry average of 30-35. Revenue and Earnings Growth: AMD has exhibited robust revenue growth, driven by its strong product portfolio and increasing market share in both consumer and data center segments. The company's revenue grew by over 20% year-over-year in the last few quarters. Intel, despite facing competitive pressures, has maintained stable revenue streams, with significant contributions from its data center and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Cash Flow and Profitability: Both companies generate substantial cash flows, supporting their ability to invest in R&D and return value to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. AMD's free cash flow margin stands at around 10%, while Intel's is approximately 20%. Strategic Initiatives and Technological Advancements Product Innovation: AMD's Ryzen and EPYC processors have gained significant traction, challenging Intel's dominance in the CPU market. The company's advancements in 7nm and 5nm process technologies have positioned it as a formidable competitor in both consumer and enterprise markets. Intel has made strides in expanding its product lineup, with significant investments in AI, machine learning, and autonomous driving technologies. The introduction of its Alder Lake processors and advancements in 10nm and future 7nm nodes signal a robust product roadmap. Strategic Acquisitions: AMD's acquisition of Xilinx is expected to enhance its capabilities in adaptive computing and bolster its presence in key growth markets such as 5G, automotive, and aerospace. Intel's acquisition of Mobileye and investments in autonomous vehicle technology underscore its commitment to diversifying its revenue streams and capitalizing on emerging tech trends. Market Trends and Competitive Landscape Demand for Semiconductors: The global semiconductor market is projected to grow significantly, driven by increasing demand for high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, and IoT applications. Both AMD and Intel are well-positioned to capitalize on these trends. Competitive Positioning: AMD's competitive pricing and performance advantages have enabled it to gain market share from Intel, particularly in the desktop and server CPU markets. Intel's extensive ecosystem and strong brand equity continue to make it a preferred choice for many enterprise customers. Underappreciated Catalysts Supply Chain Resilience: Both companies have demonstrated resilience in navigating the global semiconductor supply chain challenges. AMD's partnerships with TSMC and Intel's plans to build new fabs in the US and Europe are strategic moves to mitigate supply risks and ensure capacity for future growth. Expansion into New Markets: AMD's foray into gaming consoles with partnerships with Sony and Microsoft, as well as Intel's advancements in the data center, networking, and edge computing, present substantial growth opportunities that are not fully reflected in their current valuations. Conclusion In conclusion, AMD and Intel are undervalued stocks, with market prices that do not fully reflect their intrinsic value, robust financial performance, strategic initiatives, and potential for growth in the rapidly evolving semiconductor industry. Investors should consider the compelling investment case for both companies, driven by their innovation, competitive positioning, and resilience in the face of industry challenges. As the global demand for semiconductors continues to rise, AMD and Intel are well-equipped to deliver sustained value, making them attractive opportunities for long-term investment.",0.5699,"['POSITIVE', 0.9975]"

Intel - Pinnacle of failure.csv,"Intel's Slippery Slope: Financial Woes, Investor Distrust, and Leadership Issues Intel Corporation, once a dominant force in the tech industry, is now grappling with a series of significant challenges that have fueled a troubling decline. Despite attempts to project a positive outlook, the company’s current trajectory suggests a troubling downward spiral. Financial Performance and Market Challenges Intel's financial performance has continued to deteriorate. For the first half of 2024, Intel reported revenues of $24 billion, marking a slight decrease compared to previous periods. This decline is occurring amid a broader tech sector recovery and highlights Intel’s struggle to maintain its competitive edge. The company's net income for this period was a mere $800 million, translating to a profit margin of approximately 3.3%, indicating substantial operational inefficiencies and intense competition from rivals such as AMD and NVIDIA. Declining Customer Satisfaction and Product Concerns Customer dissatisfaction remains a critical issue. The release of Intel's 14th Gen Core processors has not addressed the performance inconsistencies that plagued previous models. While the company has introduced new features, reviews suggest that these updates have not significantly improved reliability or performance compared to competitors. This ongoing issue is eroding customer trust and impacting market share. Eroding Investor Confidence Investor confidence in Intel is faltering. The recent involvement of Apollo Global Management has raised concerns, particularly following Apollo’s controversial investment decisions in other sectors. Additionally, a recent lawsuit filed by major institutional investors alleges mismanagement and failure to deliver on key performance promises. This legal battle has further shaken confidence, prompting several large investors to divest from Intel, exacerbating the company's financial strain. Leadership and Legal Troubles Intel's leadership is facing intense scrutiny. Recent high-profile exits, including the departure of several senior executives, have led to a perception of instability at the top. The company's reliance on legal strategies to address its challenges, rather than focusing on operational and strategic improvements, appears to be aggravatinh its difficulties. This reactive approach is not addressing the underlying issues affecting Intel’s performance. Future Prospects and Potential Downturn Intel’s future prospects remain uncertain. Despite a significant $15 billion R&D budget, the company’s progress in key areas like AI and autonomous driving lags behind that of its more agile competitors. Moreover, while short-term production issues in Taiwan have provided some temporary relief, these are unlikely to reverse the long-term downward trend. The competitive landscape continues to evolve rapidly, and Intel’s slower adaptation could hinder its recovery prospects. TL;DR Intel’s current strategy, which includes overhauling its product lineup and executive team, appears to be a desperate attempt to stabilize its position. For investors and stakeholders, the warning signs are clear: Intel’s challenges are substantial, and the company’s efforts to turn things around may not be sufficient in the face of ongoing and evolving issues.

Intel DD.csv,"🚀INTC – Here's the DD You Need🚀 🚀 Summary Intel (INTC) is poised to skyrocket to $70-100 per share once they establish themselves as the go-to foundry. TSMC is slipping up and lagging in high-NA EUV. In 2-3 years, Intel's foundry business will be dominating. 🚀 The Catalyst: Intel's Foundry Push TSMC's Slip-Up: TSMC is behind on high-NA EUV tech, opening a huge window for Intel. Intel's Timeline: Expect Intel to capitalize on this in the next 2-3 years, becoming the top choice for chip manufacturing. 🚀 One API and Gaudi 3: The CUDA Killer One API Rollout: Intel’s One API, supported by big names like GOOG, Arm, Qcomm, and Samsung, is set to dethrone NVDA’s CUDA. Gaudi 3 vs H100: Intel’s Gaudi 3 will outperform NVDA's H100, making Intel the new favorite for AI acceleration and datacenters. CUDA’s Weakness: NVDA's market share is heavily reliant on CUDA. Once One API is fully rolled out, NVDA's grip on the market will loosen. 🚀 Competitive Advantage: Software Over Hardware The Software Edge: While anyone can build a good GPU, the real money is in the software ecosystem. Intel’s One API will give them a massive edge over AMD and NVDA. Market Perception: A lot of people underestimate Intel stock. They don't realize the potential they're holding. 🚀 Conclusion Intel is massively undervalued right now. With the impending dominance of their foundry business and the rollout of One API, INTC is set to soar. Don't miss out on this rocket ship to $70-100 per share. Get in now and thank me later.

Intel is a good buy.csv,"We are all well aware Intel is having it's own Boeing moment right now with design flaws in their CPUs and horrible customer service. They deserve the steaming pile dooky that is currently sitting atop their share value. That being said, they have an ace that may flip the entire market on it's head: They own their fabs. That's right: all the other big boys in town design and give their blueprints for TSMC to manufacture. That's true of AMD, Nvidia, and other ARM and mobile chip designers. Intel is the only large scale chip designers that is more or less vertically integrated. As you may know, they just got $8.8B from papa Biden to build more foundries in Ohio and Arizona, in addition to their other sites across the world. None of this is particularly noteworthy until you consider that China has always been very interested in Chinesing Taiwan, and are even more so now that they have been embargoed from Nvidia chips by the US. The Chinese military build-up over the past decade has focused heavily on amphibious warfare, and long range anti-naval weapons (think carrier buster ballistic/boost-glide stand off weapons.) It doesn't take a Ph.D in geopolitics to understand what the move is here. On the US/allied side, the discourse around Taiwan has slowly shifted: what started out as ""we have overwhelming force and we will stop any attempt at an invasion of Taiwan"" has become something like ""Maybe we can't stop them from invading, but we can make it a Pyrrhic victory"". This may actually be the case, but the trend is not great. You will have noticed Taiwan has been increasingly politically isolated, mirroring the growing Chinese military power in the region. So what happens to TSMC if Taiwan gets Chinesed? As you can imagine, China is interested in acquiring as many TSMC assets and personnel intact as possible. This means you can bet your degenerate bacon that US intelligence services have contingencies to extradite key scientists and engineers, and scuttle the production plants and machines before the Chinese can take control of them. But the result is easy to predict: no more TSMC. This means the personnel extradited will be used to advise and run US production plants owned by, you guessed it: Intel. Intel will have a quasi monopoly on chip manufacturing. The US government see this of course, that's why they are strongly nudging Nvidia to play nice with Intel, because they see a potential future where Intel is the only player in town capable of making Nvidia chips, or any consumer chips at all for that matter, in the West.

Intel is a pretty safe bet and are undervalued.csv,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs. An additional benefit is that Intel can leverage their fabs in order to achieve higher margins for their own products. It's possible Intel's stock could be hit again in a month or so when their report comes out, but they are likely already at bottom.",0.5493,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9999]"

Is INTC undervalued .csv,"Valuation Analysis of Intel Corporation Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has long been a key player in the semiconductor industry, but recent market developments and the rise of competitors like AMD and Nvidia have caused its stock to significantly underperform relative to its peers. As of Q2 2024, Intel’s total assets amount to approximately $182 billion, with liabilities around $91 billion, resulting in a net asset value of $91 billion. Yet, its market capitalization is around $95 billion, reflecting an almost 1:1 ratio between market cap and net assets. In contrast, competitors such as AMD and Nvidia trade at significantly higher premiums, indicating that the market may be underpricing Intel’s growth potential. Company Market Cap (Billion $) Net Assets (Billion $) Price to Net Asset Ratio Intel 95 91 1.04 AMD 266 56.5 4.71 Nvidia 3,000 58.15 51.58 Understanding Intel’s Valuation The Price to Net Asset Ratio (P/NAV) is a critical measure of how the market values a company relative to its net assets. Intel's current P/NAV of 1.04 reveals that its market value is nearly identical to its net assets, a valuation that appears surprisingly low, particularly when compared to its competitors. AMD and Nvidia, for instance, demonstrate P/NAV ratios of 4.71 and 51.58, respectively. This significant gap highlights the possibility that Intel is undervalued, especially given its strong fundamentals and growth potential. Several factors support this assessment. Despite facing fierce competition, Intel remains a leader in the semiconductor industry, known for its quality and innovation. The company is making substantial investments in new technologies and manufacturing capabilities, positioning itself to capitalize on growing trends such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, Intel boasts a robust balance sheet, with total assets of about $182 billion and liabilities around $91 billion. This financial strength provides a solid foundation for future growth and strategic initiatives. Although the recent decision to lay off 15,000 employees might seem concerning, it is part of a broader strategy to enhance operational efficiency and focus on core competencies, enabling Intel to adapt more effectively to evolving market demands. A key factor influencing Intel's future is the increasing global demand for semiconductors. As technology becomes more integrated into daily life, the need for high-performance chips continues to rise. Intel's resources and commitment to innovation position it to capture a larger share of this expanding market. Moreover, government support for the semiconductor industry adds another layer of potential upside for Intel. Given the strategic importance of semiconductor manufacturing in light of global supply chain challenges, particularly concerning the Taiwan-China situation, there is growing interest from government entities to bolster domestic semiconductor production. This focus on strengthening local supply chains can create favorable conditions for Intel, as it could receive both financial incentives and regulatory support to expand its operations and enhance its competitive positioning. Conclusion In summary, Intel Corporation is significantly undervalued based on its current P/NAV ratio. The company possesses strong assets, a history of innovation, and a strategic focus on future technologies. As Intel continues to execute its strategic plans and navigate market challenges, it has substantial potential to regain its competitive edge and achieve remarkable growth. Furthermore, the increasing government interest in supporting semiconductor manufacturing amid geopolitical uncertainties enhances Intel's prospects. The market's current valuation does not adequately reflect Intel's true value and growth potential, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

Long-time AMD Holder (Cost Basis 1904) Starting to Sell - Anyone Else Disappointed in the Stock in 2.csv,"Wrote about my thinking below... Out of the 31 large banks, 25 have a “buy” rating and 6 have a “hold” rating on AMD 0.29%↑. It’s hard to think about why to sell when everyone is telling you to buy, but I am of the opinion that is when it should be most deeply considered. image credit to tipranks.com AMD has been my most profitable investment of the past 5 years, having risen 800% since purchased in August of 2018. For most investors (including myself), it’s difficult to part with winners. Not only that, I am someone who believes AI will proliferate throughout society in the coming years. Because they design data center GPUs, AMD should be one of the primary beneficiaries as the AI boom continues. It might seem counter-intuitive then to sell the stock here, but that is what I’ve begun doing over the past two weeks. I had high hopes for AMD this year, but it’s my view that they've failed to take significant data center GPU market share from Nvidia, and will have increased competition from Intel's new product offerings (on both client and data center), as well as proprietary silicon from large cloud players (Google, Amazon, etc). My original thesis was that AMD would profit from overextended Nvidia margins in 2024, but this underestimated the CUDA ecosystem moat that existed with Nvidia data center products (see Why I Got Nvidia Wrong). While most large cloud players want to diversify at least somewhat from Nvidia, they are still unable to do so without risking a competitive advantage with their own AI offerings. Add Intel into the mix, and the margin and market share pressure will be on AMD. The only player in the silicon value chain I think which can currently raise margins is TSMC (TSM 2.61%↑), but the geopolitical risk is too high for me to continue holding the stock (I sold my TSMC stake two weeks ago). On the PC (personal computer), Nvidia has always had a strong moat. It’s not just because they have the best performing products, but also because game developers are economically incentivized to optimize first (and often only) for the largest potential audience. This is similar to the moat CUDA protects on the data center side. One might think that Nvidia charging incredibly high prices for discrete graphics cards would cause them to lose share to AMD with consumers who directly purchase the products (as opposed to businesses who purchase the data center products). Yet Nvidia market share has only grown over the past few years. Data from Jon Peddie Research Why This Take Could Be Wrong: There is a lot of bullish momentum in the investor community around AMD currently from both professional commentators and retail investors (e.g. Twitter / X). Many people who had never heard of AMD 5 years ago are now saying to put money into the stock as it is Nvidia’s only pure AI competitor. As a result of this, AMD could see a dramatic rise on a positive earnings report later this month. In addition, I expect gaming revenues to surprise to the upside with the minor refresh of Xbox and Playstation consoles coming for holiday season. I still have ~260 shares of AMD remaining, and will likely hold to see if the stock jumps on the report. I think that AMD is extremely stretched in its current valuation (P/E of 205), and that any bad news could send it spiralling. Selling half of the remaining stake now is essentially a hedge against this possibility. Whatever happens with the earnings report, I will likely reduce my AMD holdings to zero in the next few months as I continue to lower exposure to companies reliant on Taiwan.",0.5591,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9976]"

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy—he's searching for that ""just right"" balance.

Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening. Value Meals to the Rescue The fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn’t translated into higher overall sales just yet. Internationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk. Defying the Odds Announcing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away. Despite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a ""buy"" and none recommending a sell. Looking Forward The golden arches are taking a ""forensic approach"" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales. So, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future.

Tomorrow, we'll get the June JOLTS report, which stands for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. This report measures job openings, hirings, and separations (like firings and retirements), offering a detailed snapshot of the U.S. job market. The May report surprised everyone with an unexpected increase in job openings, suggesting a stronger labor market. This might just be the signal the Fed needs to consider rate cuts sooner than expected. Earnings season is heating up, and the first of the Magnificent Seven stocks reports tomorrow after the close. Before Market Open Corning ($GLW) has unexpectedly become an AI favorite this year. Investors believe the glass and screen maker will benefit from the tech upgrade cycle. However, Corning’s traditionally steady growth might not match these high expectations. If management doesn’t deliver impressive forecasts, a selloff could be on the horizon. Analysts are expecting $0.46 EPS and $3.54 billion in revenue. Paypal ($PYPL) faced a setback when Apple introduced a competing payment service in June. Nonetheless, PayPal remains robust, thanks to its strong e-commerce presence, Venmo's popularity, and its new checkout system, Fastlane. Optimistic shareholders are hoping for an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are $0.89 EPS and $7.14 billion in revenue. After Market Close Microsoft ($MSFT) kicks off the Magnificent Seven earnings. Investors are eager to hear updates on its AI investments, Azure cloud computing business, and future plans. Wall Street is optimistic, with all analysts rating it a ""buy."" Expected figures are $2.93 EPS and $64.36 billion in revenue. Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), a key player in the semiconductor space, will reveal its full-year sales forecast, setting the tone for the industry.

Microsoft’s Cloud Rain on Earnings Parade In a classic case of “so close, yet so far,” Microsoft ($MSFT) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, only to see its stock plummet over 5.79% in after-hours trading. Why? Investors fixated on the company’s disappointing Azure cloud revenue. Earnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints Microsoft’s revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure’s performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue—just shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub’s impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn’t enough to quell investor concerns. By the Numbers Revenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected Market Reaction and Future Outlook While the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft’s other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure’s growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn’t enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft’s shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500’s 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market’s laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters. Chips Ahoy! AMD’s Data Center Sales Surge 115% AMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let’s break it down. Earnings Breakdown AMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street’s expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter AI Chips and Data Center Dominance The tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company’s overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast. Other Segments and Market Reaction While the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD’s business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year AMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high. On The Horizon Tomorrow’s labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let’s be honest, they’re all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week’s job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes. Before Market Open Boeing ($BA): Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels. Expected: $3.51 EPS, $6.85 billion in revenue. Marriott International ($MAR) : The hospitality giant thrived post-pandemic with revenge spending, but the travel boom is slowing. Investors are eager to hear how Marriott plans to attract more budget-conscious travelers. Expected: $2.47 EPS, $6.48 billion in revenue. After Market Close Meta Platforms ($META): Next up in the Mag 7 parade, Meta’s spending spree on AI, including the new Llama 3.1 model, is under the microscope. The focus will be on how these investments impact cash flow and margins. Expected: $4.72 EPS, $38.30 billion in revenue. Arm Holdings ($ARM): With a staggering 94% rise in 2024, Arm’s valuation is in question. Shareholders are keen to see continued strong demand for semiconductors without sacrificing margins. Expected: $0.34 EPS, $903.57 million in revenue.",0.5605,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9997]"

My Analysis on ARM Holdings 2 Trillion+ Valuation.csv,"I believe ARM Holdings is slept on! I believe it could be the next NVIDIA. As of this writing its Market Cap is sitting at $142.36 Billion. I believe that its market cap should be ATLEAST 1 trillion due to the fact that it has an enormous market share of damn near if not more of 95% of the worlds smart device chips. What makes ARM unique is its business model. Their primary source of revenue is from the leasing of the design of the instruction set of computer chips. For those who dont know the instruction set is often referred to as an instruction set architecture (ISA), is a group of commands for a CPU in machine language. These commands tell the processor what operations to perform. Each instruction in the set specifies a particular operation to be performed on a specified set of data operands. The instruction set is fundamental to the design and functionality of computer chips, dictating how software communicates with hardware... So what is unique about this? Well I will tell you, these instruction sets are incredibly energy effecient compared to what is used currently for AI such as RISC or X86 etc. Currently NVIDIA is soaring because of the AI craze and its success has put light onto AMD, INTEL, SMCI etc but I believe ARM is a sleeper in my opinion. Their main source on revenue is through the royalties it recieves for leasing its designs. They can easily raise the royalty rate to increase their revenue stream anytime but there are some downsides. There customers could leave them and use other options. I dont think that is going to happen because lets face it their intellectual property is far better than any of the competition in terms of effeciency. AI is growing rapidly and one key expense is going to be energy consumption. Especially in these data centers. To my knowledge most data centers run on chips that use x86 from Intel. Those chips using that instruction set uses alot of energy. I believe data centers are looking to convert to a more energy effecient chip and when they do.... ENTER: ARM. Arm is currently used in almost all smart devices because again they are energy effecient. Why do we have longer battery life in a smart phones? Its because of ARM. What chips do electric cars use? ARM what instruction set does your microwave, fridge, washing machine use? ARM. Currently ARM is all over the portable device market but once they hit the data centers I believe there revenue is going to explode and therefore the market cap. There are major catalysts going down right now such as Microsoft partnering with them to make ARM based laptops and NVIDIA collaborating with them to make computers, not to mention that Tesla ordered a ton of NVIDIA chips that use ARM architecture. But my most bullish thing about ARM is what Jensen Huang said at Computex. He said that AI will eventually become physical in terms of robotics. Do you think those robotics need a energy sucker of a computerchip instruction set? No, the need the most energy effecient tech in todays age and that where ARM steps up right again. Currently we only use AI remotely (Chat GPT, Picture Generators, Etc.) but once we put AI into something physical and tangible such as robots to do everyday tasks those devices and robots need to run on the most advance and effecient software. I am currently looking at an outlook of 5-15 years and I am long on my position is this stock. We all seen what nvidia did and can only imagine what the next stock can yield the same returns and I think its ARM Holdings. Imagine going back to 2017 and investing into NVIDIA when the markect cap was the same as ARM now. Those returns look nice right if you have invested then. The time is now. Please keep in mind that i have not decided to go completely in depth of all of my research on ARM Holdings so please do your own. Also, I purposefully did not go into fundementals such as earnings and revenue on this. This is just my personal long term outlook on the research I have done. There are plenty more catalysts and risks out there so please DYOR. Feel free to comment!",0.5404,"['POSITIVE', 0.9991]"

My outlook on markets going forward - from a dear regard.csv,"January 2024: market starts to price in anticipated 4-5 rate cuts in 2024. Tech moons. Small/Mid caps stagnant. for the first quarter you could make bank - i made 30k through march and withdrew that shit to pay for my kids school. April 2024: I am now a reformed bear continuing bull strategy from the first 6 weeks: S*P drop 5.4% through April 19 - higher than expected inflation date. Push rates higher, lower # of anticipated rate cuts. I got hammered trying the same call strategy. Gave away 15k if not more. May 2024: AI AI AI every time you say AI in your earnings call the price goes up $1. S&P up 5.96% June 2024: News Report: tech doesn't even need a rate cut to continue the bull run. June 12 $AAPL says ""APPLE INTELLIGENCE"", reaches all time highs. (puts for their earnings btw). $NVDA 140% for the year? After last year we were like WTF how is this 300 a share let alone 1400 a share in June. July 2024 $GOOG $AMZN up ~80-100% for the year. Look, its logical to take profits. No shame in that especially for retail who loses out 90% of the time. July 2024: Rate cuts like 99.999% almost certain for sept. Now suddenly Small/Mid caps rally in a massive sector rotation. $SPX/$NDX tanks. Next week: 1T outflows. Then they pump and dump the russel up 12% to 2022 highs and then sell off for a quick 6% while everyones FOMOing into $RUT. Maybe more like RUT RO!!!! I Fomo'd last of dry powder MOnday but after earnings I'm turning bearish. Tomorrow 5k realized loss for me or hold to 0. Too hard to beat the street. Profit taking, buying million dollar real estate with cash like smart investors do. Sit on the sidelines and let it bleed. But here we are still FOMO'ing calls and short dated puts that would only print 1/1000 times. Over the past few days 3 mag 7 earnings all tanked and here we are. AMD? CPUs Good for gamers and graphics cards for poors. Pennies compared to $NVDA. $NVDA has a monopoly on AI software like $ASML has a monopoly on lithography and $TSM has a monopoly on chip production. $TSLA obviously seemingly doomed. Google can't take your cookies anymore, advertising revenue down MoM. Wanna get cucked by the zuck? I'm tempted to donate $1 to people wanting to buy $META calls at this point. TLDR: This looks like the same pattern we have had in 2022 and 2023 when markets take a downturn through mid-late October. Look at the previous years. I posted last week about the last 4 septembers being red. It looks like we are in another downturn. Earnings indicates it. I don't think CPI and PCE will save us this week. I'm scrounging up 25k waiting for the correction / dip / crash and buying SHARES so i never waste so much of my lifetime just to lose money speculating with options. Will post my realized losses if you think I'm BS. Thanks for reading this or just the TLDR. Looking forward to discussion!",0.5416,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9998]"
My views on why NVDA beats earnings and flies to higher supports Likley past 200.csv,"For the PE bitchers and moaners, I leave you this: AMD Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 126 NVDA Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 69 Chanos bitched and moaned all the way to the broke house where he had to close shop. Tesla preaching and evangelizing the PE did him an apostate. He's done. TESLA CRUSHED HIM. Tesla easily slid into it's PE and Chanos is no more. Same thing happened with the bitchers and moaners with Amazon, Google, etc. When a company is a quality company and especially part of the SP500, where every iteration of that index HAS TO PURCHASE this stock, you ride well, and the company easily slides well into it's PE very well and snuggly like. Just like Zuckerberg sucker punched Open AI LLM's by making it's LLM open source and scorching the Earth, So goes NVDA: Open sourcing their DATA CENTER TECH, ( a little secret, its not just about the GPU, it's the entire package, it's not just about BLACKWELL GPU. But Rack/ Data Center Tech Design and Architecture, there will BE ZERO INCENTIVE FOR CUSTOMERS TO GO TO COMPETITORS WHEN RACK ARCHITECTURE THAT FITS BLACKWELL GPU's with ZERO ISSUE, IS COMPLETELY OUT IN THE OPEN: READ SUMMARY( this is why AMD and INTEL are having such a hard time competing and frankly anybody else, unless you're DELL and WORKING with Jensen...

A plateau and lower business revenues based on estimates that TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT INFERENCE IS LESS DEMANDING THAN TRAINING. THAT BEING SAID, MARKET IS NO LONGER LOOKING FOR INSANE NUCLEAR GROWTH. BUT STEADY HEALTHY GROWTH. THAT** WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. Crazy AI nuclear growth, is not what the market is expecting. Market is expecting a healthy stable growth, now that we are near equilibrium with AI and chips, ( this is obviously not true, but it's the arguments bears try to hang on. They think Amazon will overtake a 30 year CUDA industry software environment the entire world/industry has created THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AROUND). Go look up CUDA. It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four...

Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?.. I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about.

NVDA has been all the rage and justifiably so.csv,"Since NVDA reporter its Q1 2023 earnings, revealing huge demand for AI chips, the stock has surged to $3.3T. Revenues 4x, margins up expanded and everything seemed perfect. Bulls claimed the stock was getting cheaper to decelerating growth. Quarterly revenue growth has dropped from 88% to 34% to 18%, heading towards single digits. Next quarter we’ll see just 7%. All of the marginal buyers are in — sucking the last few retail buyers in with the lure of a split. History suggests short term bump after a split as we are seeing, but now institutional investors have a vast pool to distribute their shares in coming months. As the saying goes, “when the ducks are quacking, feed them.” If the quarterly revenue growth continues to moderate, earnings growth will be impacted as well — making the stock become more and more “expensive” (multiple screams higher) versus the theme of last year when the higher it climbed the “cheaper” it got. This does not change the fact that it is a great business with a great leader — which will play a role in the advance of AI technologies and productivity.

And then we have a rich, a very aggressive cadence of Falcon Shores products following that. We also added the Gaudi 3 PC IE card to it, this use case of Xeon plus an accelerator or Gaudi accelerator is getting very good response from customers as well.

"NVDA will hit 5T market cap in 2026, and 10T market cap before 2032.csv","Hi regards, This is not a ""copium"" post about the recent stock price drops. I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest. The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY. First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"". Name Stock price EPS SP/EPS ratio AAPL 230 1,4 164 MSFT 413 2,95 140 AMD 145 0,16 1.035 META 516 5,16 100 AMZN 171 1,26 135 NVDA 116 0,68 170 As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price. But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list. AAPL Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits. How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new. But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more. MSFT They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are. They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy. They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office? AMD I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first. Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware. Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software. And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section. META They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value. ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS. AMZN The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL. NVDA AND OUR STAR CHILD. HOT TOPIC OF 2024. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company. Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?

Nvidia is down 17% from its peak. Its hard to call the bottom, but yesterday we saw a major flash crash followed by a v back up. Much like the opposite of the ""blow-off"" tops that we see when the bull runs peak. Big volume selling, big volume buying. Big down, big up. I expect the fast bears used that to get out.

For this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that a trillion dollars’ worth of general-purpose data centers will inevitably transition to accelerated computing. “We’re in a computer revolution,” Huang said, pointing out that the first wave of data center modernization is driven by generative AI, which he described as more than just a tool—it’s a skill. Huang also emphasized the need for “densification,” with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) aiming to make data centers more efficient by compressing them into smaller spaces. He discussed NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it. Nvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia. Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave. At Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range. Of course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.

Nvidia The only problem you're gonna have is that you didn't sell more.csv,"Introduction Alright, so Nvidia is crazy overvalued right now. Just check out its P/E ratio – it's sitting at a whopping 73.94. And that's not all. Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.55, and the price-to-sales ratio is over 42. These numbers are way above what you typically see for tech stocks and the semiconductor industry. There are two big reasons why Nvidia's stock might take a hit: growing competition and lowered margins. Growing Competition First off, the competition is heating up big time. 🔥 AMD's MI300 series is a beast, merging CPU and GPU on the same chip, which is great for performance and energy efficiency. This is super important for data centers and AI applications, and it could seriously cut into Nvidia's market share. AMD is coming in hot, and Nvidia might end up feeling the burn. Then you've got Intel with their Gaudi3 GPU, which is packing some serious performance and efficiency for AI and machine learning tasks. More people might start switching to Intel's GPUs, giving Nvidia a run for its money. Intel's Gaudi3 could be the ghost in Nvidia's machine👻 Lowered Margins Then there's Amazon, which is throwing its hat into the ring with custom GPUs for their EC2 instances. These GPUs are optimized for machine learning and AI, and they integrate perfectly with Amazon's cloud services. This seamless integration could mean less reliance on Nvidia's products, pushing Nvidia to cut prices to stay competitive. Lower prices mean lower margins, which isn't great for Nvidia's bottom line. Amazon could very well turn Nvidia's margins into margin call memes. 📉 Adding to the heat, TSMC is thinking about jacking up production fees for Nvidia. The chairman's plans to raise prices could eat away at Nvidia's margins even more. If TSMC hikes those fees, Nvidia might have to dig deeper into their pockets, and that could be a real pain in the margins. 💸 Link (06/04) So yeah, Nvidia's stock might be flying high right now, but with all this competition and pressure on margins, it might not stay that way for long. It's looking like Nvidia might be headed from tendies to tears if they can't keep up. 😂 TL;DR Nvidia is trading high, but AMD, Intel, and Amazon are bringing the heat. 🔥 Competition + TSMC price hikes = potential margin squeeze. Stock might go from 🚀 to 💥 if they don't keep up. 😂",0.5456,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9812]"
Nvidia's Blackwell Delay Offers Investors A Chance To 'Add To Positions' says Goldman Sachs.csv,"Nvidia Corp (NVDA) finds itself at the center of tech speculation as reports have surfaced about potential delays in its much-anticipated Blackwell architecture. With tech giants like Nvidia often facing the heat of public and market scrutiny, the slightest hiccup can stir investor unease. But is this delay really a cause for concern, or just a blip on Nvidia’s otherwise smooth journey towards AI supremacy? According to a report by The Information, Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell chips might hit a speed bump, delaying their release by over three months due to alleged design flaws. These chips were set to ship later this year, boasting promises of up to 30x better Inference performance over their predecessors. Despite this setback, Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs advises investors to remain calm and continue with their current strategies. The delay, while not ideal, is unlikely to impact Nvidia's 2025 earnings power or its market dominance, according to Hari. “We expect there to be little to no impact on CY2025 earnings and, most importantly, the company's long-term competitive position.” Hari believes that any short-term volatility in Nvidia's fundamentals will be just that—short-lived. The Market Reaction: Opportunity or Overreaction? For those ready to jump ship, Hari's advice is clear: stay the course. Nvidia's stock might experience some turbulence, but the company’s strong footing in the AI market isn't going anywhere. “We would consider any near-term dislocation in the stock as an opportunity to add to positions.” Despite a recent 15% correction, Nvidia remains a top pick, firmly seated on Goldman's Americas Conviction List with a 12-month price target of $135, suggesting a potential upside of nearly 26%. Even with Blackwell’s reported delays, Nvidia’s projected 39% year-over-year growth in 2025 remains unchanged. Hari’s bullish stance is rooted in Nvidia’s role as a crucial player in the rapidly evolving AI sector, especially as the demand for advanced AI infrastructure shows no signs of slowing down. Implications for Rival – AMD Interestingly, while the Blackwell delays might appear as a dark cloud over Nvidia, there could be a silver lining for competitors like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (AMD). “We believe the market could perceive this development as a marginal positive for AMD — the only alternative to Nvidia today in Data Center GPUs.” Although the analysts say AMD is unlikely to overtake Nvidia due to Nvidia’s strong market position and AMD’s challenges in scaling operations, this situation could still present a competitive boost for AMD. What’s Next for Nvidia? In the tech world, where speed and innovation reign supreme, a three-month delay might seem significant. However, Nvidia’s legacy of innovation and market leadership paints a different picture. As Hari points out, “any impact to CY2025 earnings will be negligible,” and the temporary setback should not deter investors from seeing Nvidia’s long-term value. For now, Nvidia’s strategy remains rock solid. The potential delay, whether factual or exaggerated, is but a temporary hurdle, according to Hari. As Nvidia navigates this challenge, the market watches closely, with many investors seeing a buying opportunity amid the noise. For those invested in Nvidia's future, Hari’s message is clear: hold steady, as the AI revolution waits for no one.",0.5505,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9994]"
NVIDIA’s next catalyst has to be sovereign AI.csv,"NVIDIA’s current valuation is not overtly expensive (FPER: 33, PEG: 1.61 according to FINVIZ) and the GPU orders for next year are all booked. Yet the stock is meeting strong resistance around $130. I think this is partially because a lot of people have been burned by CISCO during dot-com bubble and do not want to price in the future too much. But the real concern is that their revenue is almost entirely dependent on the rest of M7 and they are charging the big tech 80 % margin. The big tech, while being hammered by Wall Street for the increased CAPEX spending, indicated during last earning that they will not reduce their investment on AI. However, they did mention that they are/plan using their NPU (Google TPU, Tesla Dojo, AMD) to reduce the usage of NVIDIA GPU. Furthermore, GPT5 and Apple Intelligence should be available to the public by the end of this year. If these do not impress, the entire AI sector may see significant slowdown. But if GPT5 shows plateauing of performance while people find Apple Intelligence interesting, paradigm could shift toward smaller models and inference efficiency, again reducing the demand for NVIDIA. To justify significant increase in NVIDIA’s stock price, they need to show that they are not entirely dependent on the Big Tech. The only other potential buyers that have as much buying power are governments. Also, if the economy is going through downturns, governments have excuse to increase their spending.

I analyzed every S&P 100 stock for how it's performed in the last 10 years for September through the end of the year through a number of metrics - absolute change, standard deviation, current performance compared to prior years, etc. This post is focused on September, but it may help spur some ideas for you to look into for the rest of the year. Here's what I found: Sector Seasonality SPY expectations are as follows: -2.60% in September +1.73% in October +4.01% in November -0.19% in December Real estate sector typically has the worst September (-5.79%) Financial sector typically has a very strong November (+5.84%) Stock Seasonality From a percentage change perspective, the seasonally top 5 worst stocks for September in order are: AMD (-6.17%) AMT (-6.08%) ADBE (-5.02%) CHTR (-4.05%) META (-3.98%) From a percentage change perspective, the seasonally top 5 best stocks for September in order are: COP (+2.98%) BIIB (+1.67%) INTC (+0.75%) LLY (+0.61%) ABBV (+0.38%) When compared to other months for how much they typically move, the seasonally worst 5 stocks for September are: PYPL MDT AMT CHTR PM When compared to other months for how much they typically move, the seasonally best 5 stocks for September are: COP BIIB INTC LLY MET 2024 September MTD Sector Seasonality compared to Typical Tech and energy sectors are having an uncharacteristically bad September Real estate sector is performing uncharacteristically well 2024 September MTD S&P100 Stock Seasonality compared to Typical Stocks performing well AMT (+5.4%) MDLZ (+4.87%) T (+5.38%) SBUX (+3.62%) PM (+2.04%) Stocks performing poorly INTC (-14.29% - sorry grandma) AVGO (-15.86%) NVDA (-13.86%) COP (-6.83%) TXN (-7.88%) This is not financial advice, especially since no advice was given here. Do with this what you will, but figure some might benefit from this analysis.

Short Call Strategy Am I Regarded or Might This Actually Work.csv,"Okay, so I'm guessing a good amount of us in this subreddit were new to options trading at some point in time, and when we were just itty bitty option noobs first hearing about them, we just thought: "" Wow! this is just the same thing as betting on stocks but with leverage right?"" (might just be me when I first got into options trading but whatever). Moving on. I assume that many people's first instinct was to go and buy a call on a stock they were very bullish on. And I would assume that once we did that, we lost the entire position because we never knew how theta decay, IV, DTE, strike price, and other factors could sink your entire position. The thing about these factors is that when you buy a call, the majority of these factors are stacked against you, and if you don't want them to be completely stacked against you, you gotta pay up for a higher premium which is gonna yield the same or less of a return then the lower priced (but considerably more risky) options. You're paying for less risk. Long Calls are usually only profitable when the underlying has a significant enough uptick to outweigh all the other factors dragging down the value of the option. I'm sorry I don't mean to repeat the basics of valuing options but I think it's important to pretext them a little bit so my strategy makes more sense in the grand scheme of things. Okay, so my strategy is as follows: why buy a call, and have all of these factors stacked against you, when you can sell one, and have them work in your favor; I guess the whole basis is: the shittier the call, the better (meaning how likely it is to expire or be exercised with no value). The even better thing is we can magnify the shittiness to work in our favor on the sell side by selling balls deep out of the money calls, with low IV, and few DTE. And we can magnify this even further by selling calls on options with really shitty stocks underlying; stocks that are down 40% YTD, or just really, really stagnant not moving anywhere (might also get some sexy low IV to work in your favor there too). I don't really have any stocks in mind right now to lock this trade in off the top of my head, but $NOC and $AMD are quite down this last month and a half, and are relatively popular stocks. Like I said I need to find some better stocks for this Strat; these are not the ones I wanna go with, just what I thought of off the top of my head Now you might be saying two things: 1. ""The prices on them are probably gonna be pennies on the dollar. Sure the odds might be in your favor, but the yield is gonna be very low"", and 2. ""What fucking moron is gonna be stupid enough to buy these calls?"". To answer question 1: Why not just sell more calls? And to answer question 2: I don't think I need to illustrate the stupidity of individuals in the market, but if you need me to, here you go: WSB regards (not dissing, I am also a WSB regard who has lost thousands on YOLOs), teenagers with a Robinhood account that just found out about options, and maybe even people who are legit investors, but have bought the call as a part of some bigger options play, like a straddle, or iron condor (not to mention that in the example of the straddle, I don't think they would really give a shit if the call tanked because, well, it's a straddle lol, the put on the other side would cover the losses and make profit{and yeah there are probably more plays where this is the case that I am just forgetting about, but this is the example I'm just gonna go with for now}). Not to mention markets are huge and I've checked the open interest on some of these calls and there are hundreds going up to the thousands in open interest on balls deep OTM, 2DTE, Low IV call options. Anyways, I guess the reason I made this post is to double check with some options veteran (I've been into options for a little less than a year, but I have some knowledge on them from my job) to see if this strategy is complete delusional manic retardation, or if there is actually some substance to it. I wanna make sure there isn't some variable or factor I'm not accounting for that could tank this entire play. If anyone could let me know, that would be much appreciated, thanks.",0.5298,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9997]"

I had also stated that the stock is undervalued, however, even though the stock had skyrocketed 12.5% today, i still strongly believe that the stock is still undervalued at $875 as it hit $960 a month ago and $1229 around march. The company also had stated that they want to supply 1000 liquid cooling racks per month, and increase their 1% market share to 15% within the next 12 months. This means that the stock has a lot of room for growth and i firmly believe that it can reach a market cap of $75 billion after its next ER, which would make the share price at around $1300. I am currently holding 10 shares right now, which is down from my 20 shares from yesterday as i had sold at $880.

Strong AI and Semiconductor weeks ahead.csv,"Hi all, I think that AI and esp. Semiconductor Stocks have a couple of strong weeks ahead. Starting on Tuesday, October 15th 2024, the Open Compute Project (OCP) global summit takes place in San Jose, California. Between 9 AM and 11:30 AM there'll be short keynotes (each 12 mins) presented by Meta, NVidia, AI Clusters, Intel, AMD, Microsoft and Google (full schedule here). Now, I don't think that there'll be any big surprises. But the Summit still presents an opportunity for public remarks about how strong the demand is or what so ever. Also, there's an article that says that Broadcom (AVGO) is going to show case cutting-edge AI infrastructure. Further it is expected that Taiwan Semiconductor Company (TSM) and ASML Holding (ASML) will publish their Q3 earnings next week. TSM will present its earnings on October 17th 2024 at 14:00 Taiwan time / 02:00 Eastern Time. So pre-market movements will most likely be wild on Thursday as a large part of the industry relies on TSM. If TSM reports a great Q3 revenue, this could push Nvidia over the current all time high. Also according to Moore's law is dead, the first RTX 5000 series GPUs are ready to be sold, but are not released because of business reasons (here at 22:22). So they could still change their mind and ship in Q4. Next, it is rumored (by moore's law is dead) that AMD will release a new CPU by the end of October or early November, the 9800X3D which is an 8 Core Gaming CPU with 3D cache and it is expected that it will be the fastest gaming CPU releasing this year. Although Client is not as important for AMD, it will still be beneficial to have this CPU released before the holiday season. Especially since Zen5 Rysen has so far been viewed as rather disappointing. Moore's law is dead also mentions an RX 7650 GRE GPU, which could launch alongside Ryzen 9800X3D. Releasing a slightly refreshed and cheap RDNA3 GPU could be a good move by AMD to get rid of RDNA3 stock ahead of the RDNA4 launch in 2025. Since the Ryzen 9800X3D has not yet been anounced, I don't think that it has been priced in and could give the stock a slight boost to recover from the -4% last Thursday. Also, I although Investors were not excited about AMDs Advancing AI event, I think AMDs position in the market is still solid. According to the slides shown at the event, AMD Epic has increased its market share to 34%. And according to tests AMD Epyc Turin obliterates Xeon 6 Granite Rapids, while being cheaper. Because of this, I think AMD is in a good position to gain more server market share. Further, the news about Nvidia Blackwell being sold out for the next 12 Months is not only good news for Nvidia but also for AMD. Sure, everyone wants blackwell. but if one can't get blackwell and if AMD Instinct MI325X is faster than Nvidia Hopper (H200), then they might be able to win over customers from nvidia, who would like to buy blackwell but can't in due time. Also, AMDs earnings should be reported on October 29 2024. Due to Ryzen Zen5 being disappointing and there being apparently a large RDNA3 stock remaining. If AMDs Instinct systems are selling well, this would also be good news for Micron Industries (MU), which produces high bandwith memory (HBM3e). And then there's Intel. Their newest releases seem to have been disappointing. But they claim to be making progress with their foundries.

They are frequently gamers, so they need to buy NVDA GPUs and AMD CPUs. They often buy these at AMZN. They buy YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, so they can skip the ads of their fellow influencers (GOOGL) They spent most of their waking hours at META's Instagram website. They drive a TSLA or RIVN. They're on the GLP-1 drug (LLY) to impress their SOs. They're churning their credit cards with AXP Platinum and Gold, JPM's Chase Sapphire Preffered (no, NOT Reserve), some younger ones need to rely on COF's Venture and Venture X cards that gave nice ""subs"". They use these cards frequently to eat out and earn those points at CMG, SHAK and SG. They're flying a lot on DAL, and they need their free wifi that is often sponsored by their preferred choice of mobile carrier, TMUS. To get to the airport they need to use UBER or LYFT, since they don't want to drive their sweet electric ride. When they arrive at their destination airport, they pick up their rental car, and of course they prefer AVIS (CAR), but their credit cards give them presential circle status on HTZ, so they are ok with that too. They check into their hotel room at Marriott (MAR) to impress their friends, but really they are using all their Chase points to book Hyatt (H) hotels. The slightly less premium young ones will have to go Hilton (HLT) and fly on UAL. They often booked all this travel on EXPE or BKNG. Sometimes they use ABNB.

"The next tech giant Why HOOD, PLTR and DKNG are the investment opportunities of a lifetime (Part 1).csv","I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong. $AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice. $NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were. And so in true wsb fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB. There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long. From a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about. And so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry : If you are under 40 years old, $HOOD (Finance), $PLTR (Defense) and $DKNG (gambling) will 100x during your investment horizon.

The short report for Intel (INTC) - A rabbit hole of CPU failures rate since 2022.csv,"Forenote: Im a technical person, A developer, this will be a technical DD to show how intel is failing to do their basic business model of manufacturing CPUs. Over the past month or so Intels customers have been becoming increasing irrate about CPUs just flat out dying after various finger pointing from Intel being debunked. I first caught wind of intels failures when a friends system started to become unstable, he would crash in games and sometimes doing mundane tasks. It all came to a clicking point when his systems files started becoming corrupted and he needed to attempt reinstalling windows. The attempts failed, windows couldnt even install without corrupted files, sometimes it would install and look fine, but running a verification shows that various system files were still corrupted but not important enough for the system to boot successfully. He would still get various crashes doing mundane things and gaming. It was basically a working brick at this point. So i got my research hat on, and discovered various reddit users on r/pcmasterrace were also reporting instability with their PCs. Not alot tho, this has been the wierd thing, Intel has such a large CPU failure rate, but not alot of reports which caught everyone by suprise. It started to make sense, the causes of the crashes were different for everything. Users were reporting issues with Nvidia, Issues with RAM, and issues with corrupted data. Obviously to any layman, these issues dont instantly point to an issue with the CPU. With GPU errors, Nvidia initially got heat, but Nvidia quickly debunked the issue reporting the GPUs that were returned were fully functional and had no issues. So I pulled out my handy dandy debug tools since my friend managed to get windows installed and it kinda runs. The first tests I ran were memory block verification. This validates that the memory is able to hold data immutably, after 4 hours the tests finished all green, the memory was stable and wasnt corrupting data. (its worth noting that the memory test software I used was very CPU lite so the CPU has little chance to corrupt the data its self, this is a stark difference to the Drive tests I ran.). Since my friend was getting corrupted files almost everytime he install anything, I ran the disk debug tools, these pull the S.M.A.R.T data from the drive and run various read and write tests. The S.M.A.R.T data came back green, the drive was reporting it had no errors or irregularies and was functioning fine, So i moved to the read and write tests, all red, the drive had a 90% file currption rate, I pulled the S.M.A.R.T data again, All green, the drive was still reporting it was functioning correctly. At this point, anyone would deduce they had a bad drive that was misbehaving, leading to the decreased number of CPU failure reports. After all, How can you say the CPU is bad when you have corrupt files? Many people forget how much the CPU is responsable for. When you read files or write files, its the CPU that tells the Drive what to store and where and what to read and where it is on the disk to read it from. and as i said, the software I used to test the drives is CPU intensive, it uses the the CPU to generate random data to store on the drive and hashes that data to verify it. So a bad CPU = Currupted data on the drive. Luckly my friend has 4 drives, So I told him to take out the ""bad"" drive and put in another one, I ran all my tests again and same result, the drive was reporting it was functional, but all the data was corrupted. The result was the same with all the drives tested. Now, this is a luxary many people dont have. Many people would get corrupted data on their drive and think the drive is dying and get a new one. However with 4 tests samples all failing the same way when days ago they were all fine is a very low chance. Now for the kicker, Intel has a tool to verify that the Intel CPU you have is a genuine Intel CPU, I guess intel has a problem of china making fake intel CPUs??? Ive never seen any but what the hell, its a useful tools since its does some basic CPU level checks. So i ran the verifier tool and its first test for a genuine CPU comes back green, Cool, it is a real Intel CPU. Memory test comes back green (We alreadt tested this soo good), next was the Graphics tests. Failed, the CPU was attempting to send data to the GPU and it corrupted the GPU memory. So now we have 2 symptoms. Disk data corruption GPU memory corruption My friend has Nvidia GPU and Nvidia previously debunked any issues with their GPUs. But we have a common cause, Intel CPUs are corrupting data when sending it to another device in the system (except RAM), Data sent to a disk gets corrupted and data sent to the GPU gets corrupted, which would explain the game crashes. Various other tests passed from boost speed changing, Wifi tests and math operations. After I finished all the tests and determed the issue is with the CPU, my friend RMA'd the CPU. This is where more troubles start. Intel refused the RMA, citing user damage, According to intel all the issues my friend was having was his fault and he caused the damage, After it was refused, I filed the RMA for him, to the same response, but because im a stickler I pushed for more info, Intel was refusing the RMA because of overclocking done by the motherboard. This is a previous blame game intel played, they were blaming Motherboards for putting in stock overclocks on CPUs causing them to fail, but this wasnt the case with my friend, his motherboard wasnt even stock overclocked, but intel refused it anyway. After this point is when the waterfall started coming down, a advanced tech-youtuber posted an exposé about intels CPU failures. See: Intel has a HUGE problem - Level1Tech the curtains were starting to fall, Apparently Game developers and datacenters (Intels BIGGEST customers) were getting large amounts of CPU failures specificly with intel CPUs. Now datacenters are normally quiet about this type of thing, opting to sort their issues directly with intel, but intel is turning away datacenters RMA's of thousands of CPUs, these datacenters has since publicly reported they are dropping intel systems from their products and only supporting AMD systems from now on. Intel has lost their largest customer base, because of their defective products and refusing to take responsability for the product inherit flaw. Intel is hoping this goes unnoticed, since reports are still low of CPUs failing because the errors are random and different each time and users dont know their CPU is defective, there isnt a big in your face ""The Intel CPU in this system has errored"" its always an error with something else, which is caused by the CPU. So intel is betting on customers blaming other manufactures like they did with Nvidia when this all started.

Edit: Ive received internal leaks from Intel employees explaining internal issues and intels failures. Source 1: The leading theory inside Intel right now, and it is just a theory, is that the Ring Bus is getting cooked because it's fed by the same rail as the P-Cores and E-Cores. Raptor Lake required incredibly high voltages that the clocks required to be competitive with Zen 4, and it seems like it was just pushed too hard. This is an inherent flaw that would be in Bartlett too it's overvolted. Meteor Lake isn't affected, and Emerald Rapids is unlikely be effected materially. Source 2: I never worked directly on Raptor Lake [Intel Design Engineer], but I did have exposure to Alder Lake, and I can confirm that they were very concerned about the ring bus getting damaged if the voltage was pushed too high. I can also confirm that Raptor Lake was rushed through the design and validation process...

The Worst Start of August Since January 2016.csv,"JP Morgan economist Bruce Kasman commented that aside from maintaining a 45% chance of a recession in the U.S. next year, he has also raised the likelihood of the U.S. economy entering a recession by the end of this year to 35%! This probability is higher than the 25% at the beginning of July, mainly due to various data indicating that the demand for labor is weakening more severely than expected, with initial signs of layoffs already appearing! JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon also stated that a U.S. recession is the most likely scenario, with the chance of a soft landing being between 35% and 40%! Multiple economists have expressed their views, casting doubt over the economic rebound and causing U.S. stocks to open high but close low last night. 👉 The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 230 points, and the S&P 500 index dropped by about 0.8%!

RMA's are not cheap and the amount of money and time they are spending to fix the issue for existing chips while trying their hardest to deny RMAs for failed CPUs.

VSH - The Forgotten King of Chips.csv,"TLDR: $VSH (Vishay Intertechnology) is printing money while everyone sleeps on it. $VSH just got the stamp of approval from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, confirming it as a hidden winner in Nvidia’s AI and RTX 50 supply chain. With key wins in MOSFETs, capacitors, and resistors, $VSH is now primed for explosive growth, riding Nvidia’s dominance in AI servers and GPUs. If you’re not jacked up on $VSH, you’re not meant to have money. Who is $VSH? Vishay Intertechnology is a veteran in the electronics industry. They make essential components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and semiconductors. You know, the boring stuff that makes your GPU, PS5, and electric toothbrush actually work. They’ve been doing this since 1962. That’s right, this company has survived every market downturn, bubble, and chip shortage in the last 60+ years. Meanwhile, you can’t even survive a red day on SPY. Why $VSH is printing money: Chips are everywhere—cars, phones, smart homes, AI servers. The global semiconductor market is growing at an insane pace (projected $1 trillion market by 2030). Guess what? Vishay is supplying the guts. Look at their P/E ratio: 12.5 (as of last check). Compare that to Nvidia’s 75+ or AMD’s 30-ish. $VSH is practically trading at the bargain bin, and yet their revenues are consistently strong. Vishay’s last earnings report crushed expectations, with double-digit growth in several segments. They’re sitting on $3.4B in annual revenue with plans to scale. Oh, and they’re buying back shares like they’re on clearance at Costco. Everyone’s hyped about Nvidia because of AI. Guess what? Vishay supplies components used in AI hardware, EV charging stations, and industrial automation. While Nvidia makes the sexy GPUs, Vishay sells the boring but essential resistors and capacitors that keep those GPUs from melting your motherboard. They’re eating up the market share. Recent Catalysts: Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo dropped a bombshell: Vishay is a key supplier for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI servers (GB200 series, DGX/HGX B200) and the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. These are Nvidia’s future bread-and-butter products, dominating AI and high-end gaming. Vishay replaced Infineon as Nvidia’s MOSFET supplier. Yes, Infineon, the semiconductor giant, just got sidelined. This Is MASSIVE for $VSH. Vishay is providing MOSFET/DrMOS (VRPower), vPolyTan (Polymer Tantalum Capacitors), and Current Shunt Resistors. These components are critical for Nvidia’s most cutting-edge products: • GB200 series AI servers: Nvidia’s next-gen AI infrastructure. • RTX 50 series GPUs: The next flagship graphics cards. Vishay’s vPolyTan capacitors (especially the T55 series) are already facing a supply crunch for 2025. That’s how in-demand they are. Kuo estimates that Vishay’s MOSFET production alone will contribute 20%-30% of revenue by 2025—with above-average gross profit margins. The vPolyTan capacitors will add a high single-digit percentage of revenue with significantly above-average margins. Translation? Vishay is printing money. Vishay’s production lines are already at capacity through 2025. When your biggest challenge is meeting demand, you’re in a good spot. Beyond Nvidia, Vishay is also poised to benefit from: • Automotive rebound: As EV production scales, Vishay’s components are critical. • IoT growth: Billions of devices mean billions of tiny components. Vishay is at the center of it. The Stock Is Still Cheap Even after today’s 7% jump to $18.35, $VSH is wildly undervalued. As I said earlier, the P/E ratio is still around 12-13, compared to Nvidia’s 75+. This is a company with real earnings, real dividends, and real growth potential.

"Weekly jobless claims fall to 233,000, less than expected, in a positive sign for labor market.csv","Last night, the U.S. announced that the number of initial unemployment claims for last week was 233,000, significantly lower than the previous week's 249,000 and also below the market's expectation of 240,000! A few days ago, Mr. Wang mentioned that for the U.S. stock market to stop declining, the economic and labor data released must continue to be strong in order to ease concerns about a potential economic recession. Yesterday's sharp drop in initial unemployment claims marked the largest decrease in a year, indicating that the number of people recently unemployed has decreased. This alleviated the recession concerns raised by last Friday's non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate data, spurring a rally in U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 index surging over 2.3%, the largest single-day gain in 21 months 📈. On the other hand, the demand for the 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds at the auctions over the past two days was poor, causing the 10-year yield to exceed 4% once again! Tech giants saw a broad rebound, with Meta rising 4.2%, Alphabet up 1.9%, Amazon gaining 1.8%, Apple increasing 1.6%, and Microsoft rebounding 1%. Nvidia surged over 6%, returning to the $100 mark, leading to a rebound in semiconductor stocks. Broadcom, Micron, and Applied Materials all jumped more than 6%, while Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and AMD all saw gains of over 5%! Taiwan's ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) also rebounded, with TSMC and UMC both jumping more than 6%, and ASE gaining over 4%. However, it's still important to note that the number of continuing unemployment claims is rising, reaching its highest level since November 2021, nearly three years ago! Therefore, Wall Street's foreign investors remain concerned about the economy. For example, JPMorgan still believes the U.S. economy will enter a recession, raising the probability from 25% to 35%!

Why I am going long on Intel and letting Bad Daddy Gelsinger take me to Uranus - DD TurboNerd Post.csv,"TLDR: This stock fucking sucks, and I love it. But the developing foundry business is gonna get absolutely bananas under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for the sole purpose of developing it. They are not gonna let the other chip companies continue to take nut shots on them and they are just gonna make everyone chips for them. Anyways I all in on Mar 2025 Calls (which are like $4.50 - $5.00) right now. Here is some DD. Dog of the Dow Intel has lagged behind other chip titans such as [[AMD - AMD]] and [[NVDA -NVIDIA]] as they race to design and build chips to handle [[AI]] workloads. Both AMD and NVIDA have seen tremendous growth over the past 18 months (as of June 2024). A growth pattern that has gone completely unanswered by INTEL up until this point. Looking at the [[Price to Earnings Ratio]] of both AMD and NVIDIA it is easy to see how disconnected from earnings they have become (though they are both incredibly profitable). AMD P/E Ratio: 67.30 NVIDIA P/E Ratio: 238.53 INTEL P/E Ratio 31.79 AMD is wildly inflated relative to its competition in the space. NVDA is has a more ""sane"" price to earnings but it has also been nearly printing its own money with the amount of sales it has been making. The price of NVIDIA still ""feels"" high despite it's recent split. Another interesting metric to take a look at is the [[Price/Tangible Book]] - Where you take the current price of the stock and compare it to the tangle value of all its assets minus good will. AMD P/TB Ratio: 23.61 NVIDIA P/TB Ratio: 64.73 INTEL P/TB Ratio: 1.75 This says a few things; One either Intel has barely any assets worth liquidating relative to its stock price and the market has priced the stock appropriately, OR the price of the stock is selling for a very reasonable price related to the actual value of the company. This could be considered paying only .75 above book value of the company as a ""premium"" for future expected value. Source: Any trading platform that has data you ding dongs - go look it up. I got these from Schwab jfc. Technical Except for this past Wednesday, this company has been hard stuck around $30 after a selloff from its 52 week high of $51.28. 31.50 appears to be the most reliable resistance level we can work off of right now, then $32.50 after that. If it breaks both of those on a run up, there is literally no ceiling until $46. SO, you tell me what that means. The further you zoom out on your shitty little trading app the more you will see that this period we are in is nothing but consolidation.

Chips Act ""U.S. Department of Commerce has proposed up to $8.5 billion in direct funding through the CHIPS and Science Act to advance Intel’s commercial semiconductor projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon. Intel also expects to benefit from a U.S. Treasury Department Investment Tax Credit (ITC) of up to 25% on more than $100 billion in qualified investments and eligibility for federal loans up to $11 billion. Proposed funding supports Intel’s previously announced plans to invest more than $100 billion in the U.S. over five years to expand U.S. chipmaking capacity and capabilities critical to economic and national security and acceleration of emerging technologies, such as AI. Intel’s investments are expected to create more than 10,000 company jobs and nearly 20,000 construction jobs, and to support more than 50,000 indirect jobs with suppliers and supporting industries.

The article states that they are slated to receive up to $8.5 billion, with a B. X86 chips - Speculation With Arm taking dominance over portable computers like laptops, tablets and phones, X86 looks pretty boring. Except you have to remember that both AMD and Intel are still cranking these bad boys out like nobody's business. The raw horsepower in these for desktop workstations and servers is still not matched by ARM and probably wont be for quite a while. Sure they are not quite as power efficient, but who cares in a data center or major compute space anyways. Intel owns almost all of the IP for X86 processors too. AMD has a little bit and they have made improvements and designs of their own that they have been able to patent, but INTEL is the OG maker of these chips. Arm will probably continue to dominate the landscape, but they are the people who license their chips are going to need them made somewhere. They will have like two options. Intel or TSMC. China What happens when CHYNA pulls the trigger and takes over Taiwan. Where is everyone gonna have their chips made? Arizona, that's where. TSMC and Intel are both setting up MASSIVE Fabs there. So, when all the other chip companies get absolutely smoked I expect to see a giant green candle on that morning for INTC. I will probably write more later but this shit got way long way fast.

Why I bought Puts on MNST (Monster).csv,"Since Monster releases its earnings report after market, it’s time for some puts… or calls if you are based and want to inverse me Reason 1: High expectations - Current expectations for this quarterly are quite high.. Expected earnings per share are $0.452 as opposed to the $0.400 of a year ago . In this same light the market expects (has already priced in) a nearly 200 million dollar increase in revenue from the year prior.. Put quite simply these massive increases are already expected and priced in, and it’s much easier to fall short when expectations are this high Reason 2: Competition - PepsiCo is fighting hard for market share of the energy drink market and threw $550 million dollars for an 8.5% share of Celsius in 2022. Monster has already struggled to maintain market share versus Red Bull, which owns the largest portion of the energy drink market.. Now on top of this already stiff competition they have to deal with a whale like PepsiCo flooding the market with products like Rockstar and Celsius over time Reason 3: regulation- As more health focused initiatives take place in Europe and America, products like monster will face increased scrutiny, both from consumers and governments alike (regulations on certain contents). Reason 4: Even those who hit their goals have been getting smashed… AMD and Reddit- Now I get what you are thinking “what the heck do these companies have to do with monster”… and yea they have no direct relationship.. But even after surpassing their goals for this last quarter these companies have seen their value get smashed.. The market is being mad weird and bearish right now when it comes to earnings.

"Why I think Intel is a Misunderstood, Undervalued Play – A Bet on 18A (+EV DD).csv","Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.",0.5307,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9997]"
Why Intel is the most undervalued tech stock right now.csv,"Intel ($INTC) is an insane bargain right now, as it is trading at year 1999 stock price. Every other comparable tech stock is up 5000%-20000% since then. People are too focused on Intel consumer and data center products, which by the way are improving at impressive rate. Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3). Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD & NVIDIA offerings. But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment. Currently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons. Microsoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in. If you are a big tech company and want the best, cutting edge silicon you will have to switch to Intel foundry sooner or later.

I don't do options so maybe this is the wrong place lmao. I moved back home to my parents place when my dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Truthfully this has been the worst year of my life (and his obviously) in a lot of ways, but I've been investing since I was 16 (I'm 25 now). My dad worked in equities, so when he lost his ability to communicate effectively with me (and since I had significantly more income because I'm not paying rent) - I truthfully went ballistic on investing. Pretty much said fuck it, I'm living at home I don't need a 6 month emergency fund till I move out and went all-in. Granted 40% of my portfolio not listed here is in a 401k account entirely in the S&P 500 (set & forget just in case my equities went to hell as with the rest of my life lol). I believe in the margin of safety when investing. I like to invest in high-quality companies that generate lots of cash as the backbone of my portfolio. Since 2021 (before my dad got this cancer shit), I spoke with him and he basically said just look at the fundamentals of a company and invest in growth companies that you think will be around in 5-10 years. I look for value within growth stocks (i know paradoxical). Some of my icons in investing are David Tepper & Michael Burry. Again below is all my own experience and reflects only my own views and are not a recommendation of my company (corporate. disclaimer). My portfolio is heavily weighted (85%) between several stocks: AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL (So fucking cheap r u kidding me sorry), NVDA, AMZN, AMD, CRM, COST, RIVN (RIP), AVGO, VOO (ik not a stock) <-- I know semi(s) are very cyclical but i believe in holding all of these companies for 5-10 years, so I don't have to worry about temp. earnings beats/misses etc. Much easier to pick a stock and hold it for a while then it is to get the timing right. Roughly at 175% return in the past 3 years. (hammered META at $100's, NVDA at $200 both in 2022) Roughly 15% of my bets are moonshots (note the word bet hehe) with promise but objectively could be overvalued/bad investments: CCL/RCL (both are crushing it and between them own 75% of the cruise line market), LCID/RIVN (going to 0 bc they can't scale profitably or will make u a very happy person 3 years down the line bc R2/Atlas at 45k/50k should capture a significant portion of model y demand), TTD, DKNG/FLUT - gambling hasn't even been legalized in Cali/Texas (the biggest markets in the U.S. come on), RBLX (feels like betting against youtube in the early innings w/o realizing how much rev. they're actually recognizing), PYPL (value - cheap af (bought at $60) should turn around in a couple years) I joke I allocate like google's budget where it's 90% bread&butter and the rest are moonshots. Was very depressed (still reasonably depressed) because I'm not sure how much time my dad has. I hope in a way I can pass some of these stocks to my kid in a better place than I found it.

The investment firm noted that AMD is likely to capture a disproportionate share of these larger projects as upgrades progress. AMD's increased Q3 revenue guidance of about $6.7 billion at the midpoint reflects ""strong momentum across compute businesses,"" according to Morgan Stanley. This momentum underscores the company's effective strategy and execution, positioning it well for sustained growth. Artificial intelligence is also expected to be a significant growth driver for AMD. The company's advancements in AI technology and its strategic roadmap place it in a favorable position to capitalize on the burgeoning AI market. While there are potential delays in the deployment of new AI silicon, the overall outlook remains robust. Morgan Stanley maintains an equal-weight rating on Advanced Micro Devices and has raised its price target to $178 from $176, reflecting confidence in the company's future performance.

AI chipmaker Cerebras files for IPO to take on Nvidia - But 87% of its revenues have come from the U.csv,"The Middle East wants chips badly but US restrictions prevent the US most powerful chips entering into certain geographical areas such as China and the Middle East; this entails the UAE. Nevertheless, the UAE wants in on the GPU chips craze and is apparently willing to pay anything to enter into the chip bonanza. The UAE can't get Nvidia's, AMD's, or Intel's best GPU chips so instead they are investing heavily into alternatives such as Cerebras. There is nothing inherently wrong with this but it's also the biggest red flag as an investment opportunity. If the agreements for Nvidia chips open up in the Middle East and specifically with the UAE that could be a crushing blow to this aspiring startup. Specifically, Cerebras Systems reported a net loss of $66.6 million for the first six months of 2024, on $136.4 million in revenue. For the same period in 2023 it has a net loss of $77.8 million on just $8.7 million in sales. 87% of this revenue for the first half of 2024 was directly from the UAE G42. The other red flag from this startup is the way in which they promote their business. It's all seemingly smoke and mirrors and conveniently based on outdated GPU pricing and throughput information; which is very publically available. For some reason, Groq and Cerebras love to keep using memory to unlock speeds on small/tiny models which is impractical and inefficient for a scaled system; or a system that is a large foundational LLM. As well, they have no clue what models will do next so it's a major after the fact architecture that uses llama because they have access to it. https://cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebras-inference-ai-at-instant-speed. A prime example of this is OpenAI's GPT-o1 model that uses reasoning in coordination with its model capabilities. Because they are not being used on the forefront of this technology they don't know how or when a model's size, function, or needs will evolve into the future. All of this plus the pricing from OpenAI and Microsoft is coming down exponentially. For Example: They are referring to a 70b param model that shoves an entire model onto memory. They are going up against h100's which is a very old technology at this point. They make no reference to h200's let alone blackwell Because they are referencing such a small model the pricing model they suggest would be radically different for a 400b param model and forget about trillion param models which are coming next. They're not being truthful about tokens per s. As of today this is Azure GPT 4o and GPT 4 mini tokens per minute gpt-4o & GPT-4 Turbo global standard Model Tier Quota Limit in tokens per minute (TPM) Requests per minute gpt-4o Enterprise agreement 30 M 180 K gpt-4o-mini Enterprise agreement 50 M 300 As you can clearly see 30 million tokens per minute is 500k tokens per second and mini is 833,333 tokens per second. So i don't know why they are referring to 20 tokens per second or their 450 tokens per second seems way off. maybe they mean million. Even if that is the case and 70 b would be more like mini it is way higher than their limit. On pricing which they lay out a 3:1 input versus output is fine the price would be for mini which is a comparable model is roughly .10 cents (input) + .20 cents = .30 cents. Per million. for regular 4o it would be higher and let's face it GPT 4o is a far superior model than llama 3.1 3.33 dollar + 5 = $8.33 Source: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/ From this information what I can tell you is that what we just went over is pricing. it is not some guarantee for what a model produces per second. That shit is very random. What I can tell you is from GPT 4 to GPT 4 turbo to Gpt 4o the speed is dramatically better. GPT 4o mini is damn near real time. Take that for what it's worth. I am not saying they're being dishonest here but I am saying they are being very cheeky with how they advertise things. The company is currently being primarily supported by the UAE, with investments worth roughly $900 million for new AI supercomputers known as the Condor Galaxy series. Any growth here is singular to this source of investment and not driven by organic growth or usage. This is not a competitor to Nvidia but rather a temporary solution in the Middle East until chip embargoes are alleviated. The media here loves to use sexy headlines on non-technical verifications of what it is they are actually comparing. I.e. H100's are now old, or The fact an entity may need to serve millions of clients... No they are instead reporting self-prompting headlines from Cerebras that say things like our chips are 20x faster than Nvidia. Live Update: As I am writing and researching this topic it has just been reported by Reuters that the U.S. is setting a new rule to allow chip shipments to the Middle East including the UAE which is a boon to Nvidia and Microsoft. US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East Here are couple excerpts: WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), to data centers in the Middle East. G42, a UAE-based AI company with historic ties to China, has been a focus of those concerns. In April, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), opens new tab announced that it would invest $1.5 billion in the company, with plans to provide G42 with chips and model weights, sophisticated data that improves an AI model's ability to emulate human reasoning.The deal drew scrutiny from China hardliners in Congress, even though G42 said in February that it had divested from China and was accepting constraints imposed on it by the United States to work with American companies. LOL you can't make this up. Literally this just got reported by Reuters today 9/30/2024. This completely aligns with my argument above regarding the UAE-G42. With chips now entering into the Middle East from Nvidia and potentially others I don't know how this startup IPO makes it off the ground. I don't mean to be bearish but I don't think this is the time for them to raise an IPO without showing more progress. I could be wrong. As of now, I don't plan on buying any shares. Instead, I will be adding more shares into Nvidia because now this is bullish news for Nvidia.",0.5441,NEGATIVE,1.0

AMD CEO Lisa Su Says AI Is In Early Stages Of Multiyear 'Supercycle' 'There's Tremendous Need For Mo.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) shares are experiencing an upward trend after the company reported strong second-quarter financial results. Following the announcement, CEO Lisa Su emphasized that the chipmaker’s performance is being driven by a multiyear AI “supercycle.” What To Know: Recently, chip stocks saw a sell-off as earnings season approached, with investors questioning the timeline for significant returns on the massive investments in AI. This led to speculation that spending on AI might slow down. However, early earnings reports indicate that capital expenditures have remained robust. Su’s comments on CNBC’s “Squawk On The Street” Wednesday provide reassurance against slowdown concerns. She stated, “From the conversations that I have with our customer set and sort of the broader industry, we can see that AI is a multiyear, you know, I would call it a supercycle frankly. There’s tremendous need for more compute.” AMD reported second-quarter revenue of $5.835 billion and adjusted earnings of 69 cents per share, surpassing analyst estimates as its AI business continues to see accelerating demand. The chipmaker also updated its forecast, expecting GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion this year, up from the previous forecast of more than $4 billion. Su highlighted that analysts and investors are “hypersensitive” to minor quarter-over-quarter changes. She believes that the AI story should be viewed in a broader context, suggesting that the demand is extraordinarily high. “I wouldn’t be hypersensitive in those areas ... Are more customers using it? Is every enterprise asking for it? Are we seeing more applications on a daily, weekly, monthly basis? The answer to that is absolutely yes,” she said. “Everywhere I go, everyone wants to talk about how can we incorporate AI into our businesses faster and more efficiently ... this early in the cycle, there’s a lot of learning and experimentation, but definitely, there will be the return on the investment on the other side,” Su added. Although the return on investment isn’t “instantaneous,” it’s occurring very quickly. AI is already boosting productivity and enabling companies to bring better products to market faster. Su emphasized, “We’re investing today for the return in a couple of years, and I think that’s absolutely the right thing to do. That’s the way to think about these investment cycles.” AMD’s strategic focus on AI and its strong financial performance underscore its robust position in the rapidly evolving technology landscape, highlighting the company’s potential for sustained growth in the coming years.",0.5537,NEGATIVE,0.8673

Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year. This report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure. With Nvidia's earnings report on the horizon, AMD's results offer a useful benchmark.

"Apple reportedly seeks to lock out its competitors from TSMC's 2nm process, by booking all of its ma.csv","Apple has long been cozy with TSMC, the manufacturer of the chips that end up in ever-popular iPhone, iPad and Mac products. When you've got as much cash on hand as Apple does, it puts it in a favorable position to negotiate deals with the Taiwan-based chipmaker. Now it is reportedly seeking to lock in 100% of TSMC's bleeding edge 2nm production capacity, giving it a competitive advantage when products eventually make their way to the market. According to 9to5mac (via Extreme tech), Apple's chief operating officer met with TSMC bosses to negotiate terms to secure 2nm capacity. The report cites 'local sources', so there needs to be a pinch of salt here, but given Apple's track record of locking up TSMC's capacity, this would certainly come as no surprise. TSMC's 2nm process is currently scheduled to enter risk production in 2025, with volume production set for the second half of 2025. That means the upcoming iPhone 16 family with A18 chips will stick with 3nm, but it could mean the high end iPhone 17 Pro and Max could be the first in line to be built with 2nm technology. The specifics of deals between TSMC and its customers are obviously not made public, but it is widely accepted that Apple booked all of TSMC's 3nm capacity, at least for a period of time. These chips, including the A17 and M3 families made their way into the latest generation iPhone 15 Pros and MacBooks. That would make Apple's 2nm play unsurprising. It's easy to see why Apple would attempt to secure the maximum amount of 2nm capacity. It will give it an advantage over its competitors, as 2nm chips will allow Apple to pack in more transistors into a given area, leading to better performance or lower power consumption—if not both. Samsung has its own manufacturing capacity, and future Exynos chips will be built in-house, but 2nm Snapdragon and possibly Google Tensor chips may have to wait in line behind Apple. Even mega-companies such as Google and Qualcomm don't have the cash on hand to outbid big daddy Apple. It's not just Arm competitors that will be disadvantaged. Nvidia will want every possible power and performance advantage it can get as it dominates the market for AI processors, while AMD will also have to wait for access to the best nodes. Even Intel could find itself at a disadvantage given some of the tiles for its chips are manufactured by TSMC.

This new open standards alliance (UALink Promoter Group) for the interconnect (a.k.a backbone) of server clusters challenges NVDA's own proprietary interconnect systems, but will likely not be able to compete with the new B200 line being delivered in the coming months, due to its extreme efficiencies across GPUs and clusters.

Bloomberg Again Reports on Semiconductors With Flimsy Information on Secret Government Contacts.csv,"Usually, when things that are leaked with an intention the entity where the leak comes from is pleased with said leak. Not for Bloomberg though. Bloomberg actually accomplishes citing an anonymous source about on ongoing discussions related to chip distribution and subsequently takes that information to the White House National Security Council to ask them to comment. Here is the WHNSC's response. Bloomberg: US Weighs Capping Exports of AI Chips From Nvidia and AMD to Some Countries A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the talks but pointed to a recent joint statement by the US and UAE on artificial intelligence. In it, the two countries acknowledged the “tremendous potential of AI for good,” as well as the “challenges and risks of this emerging technology and the vital importance of safeguards.” The council responds with a no comment while directing them to a positive statement. To me, this greatly diminishes whomever the Bloomberg contact is. This is the second time that Bloomberg goes out of their way citing a leaky government source that on it's own merits isn't really that sensational at all. The headline is sensational the reality is not. The approach would set a ceiling on export licenses for certain countries in the interest of national security, according to the people, who described the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Officials are focused on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing appetite for AI data centers and the deep pockets to fund them, the people said. This isn't even news. Reuters reported on this a month ago with a much more neutral to positive tone. Which it is. Reuters: US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia to data centers in the Middle East.Since October 2023, U.S. exporters have been required to obtain licenses before shipping advanced chips to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.Under the new rule, data centers will be able to apply for Validated End User status that will allow them to receive chips under a general authorization, rather than requiring their U.S. suppliers to obtain individual licenses to ship to them. If you're tracking, this simply seems to be the 2nd half of that original conversation. There are already chip restrictions. Nvidia is already not delivering the most advanced chips to those countries. The framework proposed would allow Nvidia to deliver chips under certain restrictions and guidelines. Bloomberg acknowledges this towards the tail end of the article. While officials have debated the best approach, they’ve slowed high-volume AI chip license approvals to the Middle East and elsewhere. But there are signs things could get moving soon: Under the new rules for shipments to data centers, US officials will vet and preapprove specific customers based on security commitments from both the companies and their national governments, paving the way for easier licensing down the road. What I don't understand is why does Bloomberg like to make things salacious when they're seemingly not. There is 0 chips to parts of the Middle-East today, but the U.S. government is working on a framework that may relieve that. Reuter story from a month ago. The end.

Could PLTR go on a TSLA-like Run (70%) if Included in SP500.csv,"On June 7th, S&P 500 is set to rebalance and Palantir will be eligible for the third time. With the spotlight on AI and Palantir's continued strong performance, there's a very high likelihood it is included in the S&P, which could lead PLTR going on a Tesla-like run. First, let me break down why Palantir is a great candidate for inclusion. Inclusion in the S&P 500 index involves meeting several stringent criteria related to market capitalization, liquidity, financial viability, and corporate governance. For Palantir Technologies (PLTR) to be considered a good candidate for S&P 500 inclusion, it must satisfy these key requirements: Market Capitalization: A company must have a market cap of at least $14.6 billion (as of 2023). Palantir's market capitalization has been above this threshold for a while. Liquidity: Companies need to have adequate liquidity, with a high trading volume. Palantir's shares are actively traded, reflecting strong investor interest and sufficient liquidity. Financial Viability: The company must report positive earnings in the most recent quarter and over the last four quarters combined. Palantir has demonstrated profitability, reporting positive GAAP EPS in recent quarters (InvestorPlace). U.S. Based: Companies must be U.S.-based, with the majority of their assets and revenues derived from the U.S. Palantir fits this criterion, being headquartered in Denver, Colorado, and deriving significant revenue from U.S. operations. Public Float: At least 50% of a company's shares must be in the public float. Palantir's public float percentage is adequate to meet this requirement, with substantial institutional ownership indicating wide distribution among public shareholders Palantir meets all the eligibility criteria, the only which could be a problem is corporate governance, ie, the insiders own a lot of shares of the company; however there are tons of examples of other companies that have a similar structure. As many of you know, Tesla went on a 70% in the weeks leading up to and the month following its inclusion. However, it's not alone. Many other ""sexy/high-profile"" names go on epic runs when SP500 inclusion is announced. Twitter (TWTR) Inclusion Date: June 7, 2018 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $26 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on May 21, 2018, Twitter's stock increased by approximately 14%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, Twitter's stock increased by about 5%. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2019 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2019, NXP's stock rose by approximately 10%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, NXP's stock increased by around 6%. AMD (Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.) (AMD) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2017 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $20 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2017, AMD's stock increased by approximately 12%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, AMD's stock rose by around 9%. T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS) Inclusion Date: June 22, 2020 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on June 5, 2020, T-Mobile's stock increased by approximately 8%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, T-Mobile's stock saw an increase of about 7%. NVIDIA (NVDA) Inclusion Date: November 18, 2001 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $25 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: NVIDIA's stock saw a significant rise, roughly around 20-25%, in the weeks leading up to the inclusion. Month Following Inclusion: The stock continued to perform well, with an additional increase of around 10-15%. ""S&P 500 effect,"" is a real phenomenon and I think it's even more powerful with high-profile names like Palantir. As mentioned earlier, Tesla went on a god-like run in the weeks leading up to and after the announcement. And I think Palantir shares many characteristics with Tesla that may see it go on a similar run. Both companies have a very high-profile CEO. Alex Karp is loved by Palantir holders just like Elon is by Tesla fanboys, which leads to my most important point: retail ownership. Palantir has a significant amount of its shares outstanding owned by retail; if SP500 inclusion is announced and institutions have to buy shares it may create a similar move like Tesla's as most palantir fanboys won't sell. Like Tesla, they believe Palantir is changing the world (look at their subreddit). I think buying Palantir options is a great upside play with limited downside, depending on when you purchase your options. The inclusion announcement is on Friday after hours, so you could buy Friday before close or anytime this week and sell Monday morning if its not included for a minimum loss. And with options being so cheap, this could be a 50-bagger if it goes to 30 bucks. 6/21 23 C 6/21 25 C.",0.5557,POSITIVE,0.7174

How Terrifying is the Start of August.csv,"Just over the past three trading days, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 indices have all recorded their largest three-day cumulative decline since June 2022! Last night, the Nasdaq plummeted by over 6% at one point, and the S&P 500 dropped by more than 4%, with both indices returning to their early May levels by the close of trading. Although the major U.S. indices and individual stocks still closed with significant losses, the intraday declines were somewhat moderated. The primary reason for this was the release of the U.S. July ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, which rebounded from a four-year low in June to 51.4, exceeding market expectations and returning to the expansion zone above 50! Sub-indices, including the New Orders Index and Employment Index, also showed growth. Notably, the Employment Index reached 51.1, marking the largest increase since September of last year and the first time this year that it has entered the expansion zone above 50. This data slightly alleviated fears from last week's significant non-farm payroll decline, making the market believe that the drop in new jobs was primarily due to Hurricane Barry hitting Texas. 👉 As discussed previously, the sharp decline in U.S. stocks at the start of August stemmed from worries about the U.S. economy falling into recession. Therefore, when the ISM Non-Manufacturing number showed growth yesterday, it somewhat restored market confidence in the economy, helping to narrow the intraday losses of U.S. stocks. The U.S. stock market now needs to see positive economic growth news to recover, unlike before when everyone was hoping for bad news, anticipating a Federal Reserve interest rate cut! Hence, it is crucial to continue monitoring other economic data. If strong and robust growth numbers do not consistently appear, investors will remain concerned about an economic recession, and the trend of selling stocks for cash will not end.

The open interest is 257. lol. 257 contracts, and your boy here owns 250 of them. I’m the goddamn other side of his trade! I'm the guy that said yuuuuuuuuuup I'll take those off your hands sir. If everything holds up and SMCI opens strong tomorrow, this guy is about to be bent over a financial barrel, down 500% at open (das what the app is saying rn at least). He thought he was playing it safe, slinging naked calls like he’s DFV or something, and now he’s unknowingly writing me a fat f***ing check for $62,000 (so far). He knows I bought SMCI calls. I mentioned it in passing, like, “Yeah, I’m in on SMCI this week.” But he doesn’t know how many or what strike. I didn’t tell him I went full-blown degenerate with $12.5K on a strike so far out of the money. Now I’m sitting here, “Do I tell him?” Like, “Hey bro, funny story, you’re about to owe me your next three paychecks because I’m holding all the cards—and by cards, I mean your fuckiing calls.” Or do I keep my mouth shut and let the market gods do what they do? I feel bad, but not that bad, you know? Trading is a tough game isn't it? No mercy. So that’s where I'm going to hold a little past open and then I’m cashing in big-time, and he’s gonna be selling plasma to cover his losses. What would you guys do? Do I come clean, or let him find out the hard way? Either way, I’m buying a steak dinner tomorrow. Maybe I’ll even let him smell it. Also a hooker.",0.5248,NEGATIVE,0.9999
I wait all year for this opportunity - now I'm going to share it with you.csv,"If you trade long enough, you begin to see patterns emerge. On October 30th, one of my favorite patterns is starting. If you buy AMD stock on the last Monday of October, the average return for the rest of the year is 24.52%, and the stock is higher 88.89% of the time. This data starts in 2015 because it is the first full year after Dr. Lisa Su became CEO of AMD. Some of you may be wondering why this period is so strong for AMD stock. Let me share my personal theory. AMD depends on TSMC for chip manufacturing. Taiwan is protected by its geography and weather, but the Chinese have two windows of opportunity to cross the Strait with favorable weather. The first is from late March to the end of April. The second is from late September to late October. Last year, China launched major military exercises around Taiwan in April. This year, they did it in October, which just ended a few days ago. (They also launch these exercises when they are provoked, such as when Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan or during the recent Taiwanese elections.) In my view, the end of October triggers a relief rally in stocks related to TSMC, most notably AMD and Nvidia. This combines with earnings and strong seasonality, resulting in massive outperformance in a relatively short period of time. A quick word of warning—this time period includes earnings. If you want to avoid earnings risk, you can wait until the first Monday of November. If you wait until November, the average return is 19.06%, and the stock is higher 77.78% of the time by the end of the year. Here is a quick comparison I do all this shit manually so I apologize if there is an error in one of my calculations. My positions: Long 1000 shares with a cost basis of $157.90. Although I am considering switching to a risk reversal. I would use a risk reversal selling the Jan. 2025 $155 puts collecting 12.70 then using that to buy twice as many Jan. 2025 $180 calls for $6.50 (I would buy x2 as many calls to make the net cost ~.30)",0.5754,NEGATIVE,0.8872

INTC - A dumb person's retrospective.csv,"I'm lazy and you regards don't like to read so I'll leave it to bullet points and you can piece them together. Intel was seen as a bargain in 2023 compared to NVDA and AMD after their 400% run up. US gov have vested interest in Intel. No they are not propping Intel up, but it's effectively giving Intel a big loan to buy a second house. That loan can pay off if the housing market goes up, or they are double fucked because they leveraged to buy a second house. If you bought Intel because china will invade Taiwan, you are really regarded. If China invades Taiwan, everything is going to sell. That's a disruption of global trade on WW2 levels. Your best case scenario still loses you money. Intel bullish scenario is 18A, High-Na EUV paying dividends, early experience granting them a year technological lead over TSMC. It doesn't have to work, but the upside is a 10x from these levels. TSMC pass up High NA EUV is repeating the same decision Intel did in 2012 when Intel controlled the market and did not view EUV as economically feasible. Again, doesn't mean TSMC is incorrect in their assessment, but history does repeat itself. Intel bearish scenario is just repeat of 2016 and delay after delay. In which case they head to legacy company status like Ford. Anyone else remember all the Ford bulls in 2016? They're not on this sub anymore because they all went broke. I'm no crayon guy. But everyone can see that $30 was a magic line, and drastically going below it to $21 is a market signal that the company is now viewed fundamentally differently. Yes it can go lower, especially the general market trends change we see this week. AMD spent from 2008 to 2016 an absolute garbage penny stock.

The investment only somewhat paid off in 2018 when AMD traded to 30, but then half the regards lost everything (myself included) when it crashed to 18 in 2 months following Powell's rate hike. Look how quickly sentiment changed for AMD from 2018. This very well could be history repeating itself, as the semiconductor companies have demonstrated over and over again. Intel 18A is a repeat situation of AMD ZEN. The upside cannot be understated. I'm still bullish. Proper execution can bring the company to a $200+ stock.

Intel - Pinnacle of failure.csv,"Intel's Slippery Slope: Financial Woes, Investor Distrust, and Leadership Issues Intel Corporation, once a dominant force in the tech industry, is now grappling with a series of significant challenges that have fueled a troubling decline. Despite attempts to project a positive outlook, the company’s current trajectory suggests a troubling downward spiral. Financial Performance and Market Challenges Intel's financial performance has continued to deteriorate. For the first half of 2024, Intel reported revenues of $24 billion, marking a slight decrease compared to previous periods. This decline is occurring amid a broader tech sector recovery and highlights Intel’s struggle to maintain its competitive edge. The company's net income for this period was a mere $800 million, translating to a profit margin of approximately 3.3%, indicating substantial operational inefficiencies and intense competition from rivals such as AMD and NVIDIA. Declining Customer Satisfaction and Product Concerns Customer dissatisfaction remains a critical issue. The release of Intel's 14th Gen Core processors has not addressed the performance inconsistencies that plagued previous models. While the company has introduced new features, reviews suggest that these updates have not significantly improved reliability or performance compared to competitors. This ongoing issue is eroding customer trust and impacting market share. Eroding Investor Confidence Investor confidence in Intel is faltering. The recent involvement of Apollo Global Management has raised concerns, particularly following Apollo’s controversial investment decisions in other sectors. Additionally, a recent lawsuit filed by major institutional investors alleges mismanagement and failure to deliver on key performance promises. This legal battle has further shaken confidence, prompting several large investors to divest from Intel, exacerbating the company's financial strain. Leadership and Legal Troubles Intel's leadership is facing intense scrutiny. Recent high-profile exits, including the departure of several senior executives, have led to a perception of instability at the top. The company's reliance on legal strategies to address its challenges, rather than focusing on operational and strategic improvements, appears to be aggravatinh its difficulties. This reactive approach is not addressing the underlying issues affecting Intel’s performance. Future Prospects and Potential Downturn Intel’s future prospects remain uncertain. Despite a significant $15 billion R&D budget, the company’s progress in key areas like AI and autonomous driving lags behind that of its more agile competitors. Moreover, while short-term production issues in Taiwan have provided some temporary relief, these are unlikely to reverse the long-term downward trend. The competitive landscape continues to evolve rapidly, and Intel’s slower adaptation could hinder its recovery prospects. TL;DR Intel’s current strategy, which includes overhauling its product lineup and executive team, appears to be a desperate attempt to stabilize its position. For investors and stakeholders, the warning signs are clear: Intel’s challenges are substantial, and the company’s efforts to turn things around may not be sufficient in the face of ongoing and evolving issues.

Intel is a good buy.csv,"We are all well aware Intel is having it's own Boeing moment right now with design flaws in their CPUs and horrible customer service. They deserve the steaming pile dooky that is currently sitting atop their share value. That being said, they have an ace that may flip the entire market on it's head: They own their fabs. That's right: all the other big boys in town design and give their blueprints for TSMC to manufacture. That's true of AMD, Nvidia, and other ARM and mobile chip designers. Intel is the only large scale chip designers that is more or less vertically integrated. As you may know, they just got $8.8B from papa Biden to build more foundries in Ohio and Arizona, in addition to their other sites across the world. None of this is particularly noteworthy until you consider that China has always been very interested in Chinesing Taiwan, and are even more so now that they have been embargoed from Nvidia chips by the US. The Chinese military build-up over the past decade has focused heavily on amphibious warfare, and long range anti-naval weapons (think carrier buster ballistic/boost-glide stand off weapons.) It doesn't take a Ph.D in geopolitics to understand what the move is here. On the US/allied side, the discourse around Taiwan has slowly shifted: what started out as ""we have overwhelming force and we will stop any attempt at an invasion of Taiwan"" has become something like ""Maybe we can't stop them from invading, but we can make it a Pyrrhic victory"". This may actually be the case, but the trend is not great. You will have noticed Taiwan has been increasingly politically isolated, mirroring the growing Chinese military power in the region. So what happens to TSMC if Taiwan gets Chinesed? As you can imagine, China is interested in acquiring as many TSMC assets and personnel intact as possible. This means you can bet your degenerate bacon that US intelligence services have contingencies to extradite key scientists and engineers, and scuttle the production plants and machines before the Chinese can take control of them. But the result is easy to predict: no more TSMC. This means the personnel extradited will be used to advise and run US production plants owned by, you guessed it: Intel. Intel will have a quasi monopoly on chip manufacturing. The US government see this of course, that's why they are strongly nudging Nvidia to play nice with Intel, because they see a potential future where Intel is the only player in town capable of making Nvidia chips, or any consumer chips at all for that matter, in the West.

Intel is a pretty safe bet and are undervalued.csv,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs. An additional benefit is that Intel can leverage their fabs in order to achieve higher margins for their own products. It's possible Intel's stock could be hit again in a month or so when their report comes out, but they are likely already at bottom.",0.5493,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Is INTC undervalued .csv,"Valuation Analysis of Intel Corporation Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has long been a key player in the semiconductor industry, but recent market developments and the rise of competitors like AMD and Nvidia have caused its stock to significantly underperform relative to its peers. As of Q2 2024, Intel’s total assets amount to approximately $182 billion, with liabilities around $91 billion, resulting in a net asset value of $91 billion. Yet, its market capitalization is around $95 billion, reflecting an almost 1:1 ratio between market cap and net assets. In contrast, competitors such as AMD and Nvidia trade at significantly higher premiums, indicating that the market may be underpricing Intel’s growth potential. Company Market Cap (Billion $) Net Assets (Billion $) Price to Net Asset Ratio Intel 95 91 1.04 AMD 266 56.5 4.71 Nvidia 3,000 58.15 51.58 Understanding Intel’s Valuation The Price to Net Asset Ratio (P/NAV) is a critical measure of how the market values a company relative to its net assets. Intel's current P/NAV of 1.04 reveals that its market value is nearly identical to its net assets, a valuation that appears surprisingly low, particularly when compared to its competitors. AMD and Nvidia, for instance, demonstrate P/NAV ratios of 4.71 and 51.58, respectively. This significant gap highlights the possibility that Intel is undervalued, especially given its strong fundamentals and growth potential. Several factors support this assessment. Despite facing fierce competition, Intel remains a leader in the semiconductor industry, known for its quality and innovation. The company is making substantial investments in new technologies and manufacturing capabilities, positioning itself to capitalize on growing trends such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, Intel boasts a robust balance sheet, with total assets of about $182 billion and liabilities around $91 billion. This financial strength provides a solid foundation for future growth and strategic initiatives. Although the recent decision to lay off 15,000 employees might seem concerning, it is part of a broader strategy to enhance operational efficiency and focus on core competencies, enabling Intel to adapt more effectively to evolving market demands. A key factor influencing Intel's future is the increasing global demand for semiconductors. As technology becomes more integrated into daily life, the need for high-performance chips continues to rise. Intel's resources and commitment to innovation position it to capture a larger share of this expanding market. Moreover, government support for the semiconductor industry adds another layer of potential upside for Intel. Given the strategic importance of semiconductor manufacturing in light of global supply chain challenges, particularly concerning the Taiwan-China situation, there is growing interest from government entities to bolster domestic semiconductor production. This focus on strengthening local supply chains can create favorable conditions for Intel, as it could receive both financial incentives and regulatory support to expand its operations and enhance its competitive positioning. Conclusion In summary, Intel Corporation is significantly undervalued based on its current P/NAV ratio. The company possesses strong assets, a history of innovation, and a strategic focus on future technologies. As Intel continues to execute its strategic plans and navigate market challenges, it has substantial potential to regain its competitive edge and achieve remarkable growth. Furthermore, the increasing government interest in supporting semiconductor manufacturing amid geopolitical uncertainties enhances Intel's prospects. The market's current valuation does not adequately reflect Intel's true value and growth potential, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

Long-time AMD Holder (Cost Basis 1904) Starting to Sell - Anyone Else Disappointed in the Stock in 2.csv,"Wrote about my thinking below... Out of the 31 large banks, 25 have a “buy” rating and 6 have a “hold” rating on AMD 0.29%↑. It’s hard to think about why to sell when everyone is telling you to buy, but I am of the opinion that is when it should be most deeply considered. image credit to tipranks.com AMD has been my most profitable investment of the past 5 years, having risen 800% since purchased in August of 2018. For most investors (including myself), it’s difficult to part with winners. Not only that, I am someone who believes AI will proliferate throughout society in the coming years. Because they design data center GPUs, AMD should be one of the primary beneficiaries as the AI boom continues. It might seem counter-intuitive then to sell the stock here, but that is what I’ve begun doing over the past two weeks. I had high hopes for AMD this year, but it’s my view that they've failed to take significant data center GPU market share from Nvidia, and will have increased competition from Intel's new product offerings (on both client and data center), as well as proprietary silicon from large cloud players (Google, Amazon, etc). My original thesis was that AMD would profit from overextended Nvidia margins in 2024, but this underestimated the CUDA ecosystem moat that existed with Nvidia data center products (see Why I Got Nvidia Wrong). While most large cloud players want to diversify at least somewhat from Nvidia, they are still unable to do so without risking a competitive advantage with their own AI offerings. Add Intel into the mix, and the margin and market share pressure will be on AMD. The only player in the silicon value chain I think which can currently raise margins is TSMC (TSM 2.61%↑), but the geopolitical risk is too high for me to continue holding the stock (I sold my TSMC stake two weeks ago). On the PC (personal computer), Nvidia has always had a strong moat. It’s not just because they have the best performing products, but also because game developers are economically incentivized to optimize first (and often only) for the largest potential audience. This is similar to the moat CUDA protects on the data center side. One might think that Nvidia charging incredibly high prices for discrete graphics cards would cause them to lose share to AMD with consumers who directly purchase the products (as opposed to businesses who purchase the data center products). Yet Nvidia market share has only grown over the past few years. Data from Jon Peddie Research Why This Take Could Be Wrong: There is a lot of bullish momentum in the investor community around AMD currently from both professional commentators and retail investors (e.g. Twitter / X). Many people who had never heard of AMD 5 years ago are now saying to put money into the stock as it is Nvidia’s only pure AI competitor. As a result of this, AMD could see a dramatic rise on a positive earnings report later this month. In addition, I expect gaming revenues to surprise to the upside with the minor refresh of Xbox and Playstation consoles coming for holiday season. I still have ~260 shares of AMD remaining, and will likely hold to see if the stock jumps on the report. I think that AMD is extremely stretched in its current valuation (P/E of 205), and that any bad news could send it spiralling. Selling half of the remaining stake now is essentially a hedge against this possibility. Whatever happens with the earnings report, I will likely reduce my AMD holdings to zero in the next few months as I continue to lower exposure to companies reliant on Taiwan.",0.5591,NEGATIVE,0.9976

Wells Fargo ($WFC) must face a lawsuit over sham job interviews Rate Cut Countdown — Will the Fed Finally Pull the Trigger? Nope, the Fed isn’t cutting rates this week. But don’t snooze just yet—this meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn’t overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy—he's searching for that ""just right"" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same. Inflation: Cooling Off Inflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year’s 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the ""last mile"" of inflation reduction. The message? We’re on the right track, folks. Unemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it’s taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell’s recent take? The labor market isn’t adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a “sweet spot”—balancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals. Risk Management Reboot With inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed’s risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle—slightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed’s past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they’re determined to act promptly to avoid a recession. Some Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it’s time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn’t seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first. The Fed’s balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31. McDonald’s: The Golden Arches Stumble By the Numbers Revenue: $6.49 billion (missed $6.61 billion estimate) Earnings per Share: $2.97 (missed $3.07 estimate) Same-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020) U.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7% International Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1% International Franchised Sales: Down 1.3% McDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening. Value Meals to the Rescue The fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn’t translated into higher overall sales just yet. Internationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk. Defying the Odds Announcing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away. Despite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a ""buy"" and none recommending a sell. Looking Forward The golden arches are taking a ""forensic approach"" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales. So, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future.

Microsoft’s Cloud Rain on Earnings Parade In a classic case of “so close, yet so far,” Microsoft ($MSFT) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, only to see its stock plummet over 5.79% in after-hours trading. Why? Investors fixated on the company’s disappointing Azure cloud revenue. Earnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints Microsoft’s revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure’s performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue—just shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub’s impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn’t enough to quell investor concerns. By the Numbers Revenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected Market Reaction and Future Outlook While the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft’s other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure’s growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn’t enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft’s shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500’s 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market’s laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters. Chips Ahoy! AMD’s Data Center Sales Surge 115% AMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let’s break it down. Earnings Breakdown AMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street’s expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter AI Chips and Data Center Dominance The tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company’s overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast. Other Segments and Market Reaction While the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD’s business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year AMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high. On The Horizon Tomorrow’s labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let’s be honest, they’re all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week’s job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes. Before Market Open Boeing ($BA): Trouble in the skies and on the ground.

My Analysis on ARM Holdings 2 Trillion+ Valuation.csv,"I believe ARM Holdings is slept on! I believe it could be the next NVIDIA. As of this writing its Market Cap is sitting at $142.36 Billion. I believe that its market cap should be ATLEAST 1 trillion due to the fact that it has an enormous market share of damn near if not more of 95% of the worlds smart device chips. What makes ARM unique is its business model. Their primary source of revenue is from the leasing of the design of the instruction set of computer chips. For those who dont know the instruction set is often referred to as an instruction set architecture (ISA), is a group of commands for a CPU in machine language. These commands tell the processor what operations to perform. Each instruction in the set specifies a particular operation to be performed on a specified set of data operands. The instruction set is fundamental to the design and functionality of computer chips, dictating how software communicates with hardware... So what is unique about this? Well I will tell you, these instruction sets are incredibly energy effecient compared to what is used currently for AI such as RISC or X86 etc. Currently NVIDIA is soaring because of the AI craze and its success has put light onto AMD, INTEL, SMCI etc but I believe ARM is a sleeper in my opinion. Their main source on revenue is through the royalties it recieves for leasing its designs. They can easily raise the royalty rate to increase their revenue stream anytime but there are some downsides. There customers could leave them and use other options. I dont think that is going to happen because lets face it their intellectual property is far better than any of the competition in terms of effeciency. AI is growing rapidly and one key expense is going to be energy consumption. Especially in these data centers. To my knowledge most data centers run on chips that use x86 from Intel. Those chips using that instruction set uses alot of energy. I believe data centers are looking to convert to a more energy effecient chip and when they do.... ENTER: ARM. Arm is currently used in almost all smart devices because again they are energy effecient. Why do we have longer battery life in a smart phones? Its because of ARM. What chips do electric cars use? ARM what instruction set does your microwave, fridge, washing machine use? ARM. Currently ARM is all over the portable device market but once they hit the data centers I believe there revenue is going to explode and therefore the market cap. There are major catalysts going down right now such as Microsoft partnering with them to make ARM based laptops and NVIDIA collaborating with them to make computers, not to mention that Tesla ordered a ton of NVIDIA chips that use ARM architecture. But my most bullish thing about ARM is what Jensen Huang said at Computex. He said that AI will eventually become physical in terms of robotics. Do you think those robotics need a energy sucker of a computerchip instruction set? No, the need the most energy effecient tech in todays age and that where ARM steps up right again. Currently we only use AI remotely (Chat GPT, Picture Generators, Etc.) but once we put AI into something physical and tangible such as robots to do everyday tasks those devices and robots need to run on the most advance and effecient software. I am currently looking at an outlook of 5-15 years and I am long on my position is this stock. We all seen what nvidia did and can only imagine what the next stock can yield the same returns and I think its ARM Holdings. Imagine going back to 2017 and investing into NVIDIA when the markect cap was the same as ARM now. Those returns look nice right if you have invested then. The time is now. Please keep in mind that i have not decided to go completely in depth of all of my research on ARM Holdings so please do your own. Also, I purposefully did not go into fundementals such as earnings and revenue on this. This is just my personal long term outlook on the research I have done. There are plenty more catalysts and risks out there so please DYOR. Feel free to comment!",0.5404,POSITIVE,0.9991

My outlook on markets going forward - from a dear regard.csv,"January 2024: market starts to price in anticipated 4-5 rate cuts in 2024. Tech moons. Small/Mid caps stagnant. for the first quarter you could make bank - i made 30k through march and withdrew that shit to pay for my kids school. April 2024: I am now a reformed bear continuing bull strategy from the first 6 weeks: S*P drop 5.4% through April 19 - higher than expected inflation date. Push rates higher, lower # of anticipated rate cuts. I got hammered trying the same call strategy. Gave away 15k if not more. May 2024: AI AI AI every time you say AI in your earnings call the price goes up $1. S&P up 5.96% June 2024: News Report: tech doesn't even need a rate cut to continue the bull run. June 12 $AAPL says ""APPLE INTELLIGENCE"", reaches all time highs. (puts for their earnings btw). $NVDA 140% for the year? After last year we were like WTF how is this 300 a share let alone 1400 a share in June. July 2024 $GOOG $AMZN up ~80-100% for the year. Look, its logical to take profits. No shame in that especially for retail who loses out 90% of the time. July 2024: Rate cuts like 99.999% almost certain for sept. Now suddenly Small/Mid caps rally in a massive sector rotation. $SPX/$NDX tanks. Next week: 1T outflows. Then they pump and dump the russel up 12% to 2022 highs and then sell off for a quick 6% while everyones FOMOing into $RUT. Maybe more like RUT RO!!!! I Fomo'd last of dry powder MOnday but after earnings I'm turning bearish. Tomorrow 5k realized loss for me or hold to 0. Too hard to beat the street. Profit taking, buying million dollar real estate with cash like smart investors do. Sit on the sidelines and let it bleed. But here we are still FOMO'ing calls and short dated puts that would only print 1/1000 times. Over the past few days 3 mag 7 earnings all tanked and here we are. AMD? CPUs Good for gamers and graphics cards for poors. Pennies compared to $NVDA. $NVDA has a monopoly on AI software like $ASML has a monopoly on lithography and $TSM has a monopoly on chip production. $TSLA obviously seemingly doomed. Google can't take your cookies anymore, advertising revenue down MoM. Wanna get cucked by the zuck? I'm tempted to donate $1 to people wanting to buy $META calls at this point. TLDR: This looks like the same pattern we have had in 2022 and 2023 when markets take a downturn through mid-late October. Look at the previous years. I posted last week about the last 4 septembers being red. It looks like we are in another downturn. Earnings indicates it. I don't think CPI and PCE will save us this week. I'm scrounging up 25k waiting for the correction / dip / crash and buying SHARES so i never waste so much of my lifetime just to lose money speculating with options. Will post my realized losses if you think I'm BS. Thanks for reading this or just the TLDR. Looking forward to discussion!",0.5416,NEGATIVE,0.9998

THAT BEING SAID, MARKET IS NO LONGER LOOKING FOR INSANE NUCLEAR GROWTH. BUT STEADY HEALTHY GROWTH. THAT** WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. Crazy AI nuclear growth, is not what the market is expecting. Market is expecting a healthy stable growth, now that we are near equilibrium with AI and chips, ( this is obviously not true, but it's the arguments bears try to hang on. They think Amazon will overtake a 30 year CUDA industry software environment the entire world/industry has created THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AROUND). Go look up CUDA. It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four...

NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming Latest Sept 2025, with my guess, Jensen starts marketing from first half of 2025, and wider release commercially of NVDA CPU for 1st qtr of 2026, March, me thinks Jensen starts getting market ready all of 2025 for release in the wild September 2025 for retail user and full wider release by March 2026 / end of February 2026. Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?.. I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about.

Intel is unique in that it is set up to transform the business into a major foundry model going forward. That takes decades of investment which Intel is ahead on.

NVDA has been all the rage and justifiably so.csv,"Since NVDA reporter its Q1 2023 earnings, revealing huge demand for AI chips, the stock has surged to $3.3T. Revenues 4x, margins up expanded and everything seemed perfect. Bulls claimed the stock was getting cheaper to decelerating growth. Quarterly revenue growth has dropped from 88% to 34% to 18%, heading towards single digits. Next quarter we’ll see just 7%. All of the marginal buyers are in — sucking the last few retail buyers in with the lure of a split. History suggests short term bump after a split as we are seeing, but now institutional investors have a vast pool to distribute their shares in coming months. As the saying goes, “when the ducks are quacking, feed them.” If the quarterly revenue growth continues to moderate, earnings growth will be impacted as well — making the stock become more and more “expensive” (multiple screams higher) versus the theme of last year when the higher it climbed the “cheaper” it got. This does not change the fact that it is a great business with a great leader — which will play a role in the advance of AI technologies and productivity. It’s just going to be a heavy lift that it retains a perception of greater value than Amazon, Microsoft or the entire German Stock Market Capitalizations (where it trades now). NVDA is still a semiconductor company, which has never been a secular business — it’s cyclical. Always has been, always will be. As for 70% gross margins, as Bezos famously said, “your margin is my opportunity.” NVDA has not cured cancer. There will be more and more competition going forward. Intel’s Gaudi 3 is 50% faster than NVDA’s H100 and 40% more energy efficient. AMD is gunning for them. The game is just beginning and NVDA will be forced to share the pie as no buyer wants to be beholden to one company. NVDA is a great company and will continue to innovate. We are in an AI/productivity revolution. I would never bet against it. However… “Price is what you pay, value is what you get…” Caveat emptor at these levels.

We'll be bringing that late next year when Falcon Shores, when we combine the great systolic performance of Gaudi 3 with a fully programmable architecture and all of that comes together with Falcon Shores. And then we have a rich, a very aggressive cadence of Falcon Shores products following that. We also added the Gaudi 3 PC IE card to it, this use case of Xeon plus an accelerator or Gaudi accelerator is getting very good response from customers as well. So we'll be bringing that out later this year. But the real story is delivering the TCO value, delivering the enterprise use cases. On Falcon Shores, we'll just build on the momentum that we're establishing with Gaudi 2 and 3. "" """" Intel's management stated that Gaudi 3 delivers a 50% on average better inference and 40% on average better power efficiency than Nvidia H100."" to conclude this for now I look at Nvdia valuations, and i see high multiples attached to a company with a concentrated customer base whereby the bulk of their revenus comes from four customers using old slow h100 chips amd the ceo is dumping shares at what appears to be a bubble I look at Intel, who just launched the Gaudi 3 and already has.20 customers, and the chip outperforms the h100 .

"NVDA will hit 5T market cap in 2026, and 10T market cap before 2032.csv","Hi regards, This is not a ""copium"" post about the recent stock price drops. I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest. The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY. First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"". Name Stock price EPS SP/EPS ratio AAPL 230 1,4 164 MSFT 413 2,95 140 AMD 145 0,16 1.035 META 516 5,16 100 AMZN 171 1,26 135 NVDA 116 0,68 170 As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price. But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list. AAPL Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits. How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new. But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more. MSFT They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are. They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy. They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office? AMD I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first. Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware. Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software. And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section. META They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value. ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS. AMZN The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL. NVDA AND OUR STAR CHILD. HOT TOPIC OF 2024. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company. Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?

Until we see an IPO for SexRobots Inc, we aren't in the late stage. At the moment we've got a handful of companies beating expectations because of AI revenue (good for Nvidia, long-term), and some beating CapEx expectations because of AI spending (good for Nvidia, short-term) The current situation Look at Nvidia P/E compared to its share price. We're halfway through the year. At the end of this fiscal year, Nvidia will be worth $180 at the midline of this trend. It is currently $113. That is a 57% return, 157% on an annualized basis. Nvidia is down 17% from its peak. Its hard to call the bottom, but yesterday we saw a major flash crash followed by a v back up. Much like the opposite of the ""blow-off"" tops that we see when the bull runs peak. Big volume selling, big volume buying. Big down, big up. I expect the fast bears used that to get out. The slow ones will watch their profits start eroding before also bailing and taking their gains. The slower ones will hit their stop losses, and the slowest will drift back into the red. If you're a bear in the green, take the W and get out Upcoming catalysts Other company earnings next week - MSFT, META, SNAP, AMD, ARM Upcoming earnings What are the market expectations for next earnings? They say they are expecting $0.59 per share. But last quarter Nvidia made that, on the back of 26B in revenue. For this quarter, Nvidia predicted 28B revenue. If they hit that, we're looking at $0.66. But of course they're being conservative. Why wouldn't they? When your growth is 262% you have plenty of room to estimate conservatively. How conservative are they usually? Last time they predicted 24B and hit 26B. If roughly that amount extra happens again, we're looking at 30B in revenue and $0.70 in profit.

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that a trillion dollars’ worth of general-purpose data centers will inevitably transition to accelerated computing. “We’re in a computer revolution,” Huang said, pointing out that the first wave of data center modernization is driven by generative AI, which he described as more than just a tool—it’s a skill. Huang also emphasized the need for “densification,” with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) aiming to make data centers more efficient by compressing them into smaller spaces. He discussed NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it. Nvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia. Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave. At Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range. Of course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.

Nvidia The only problem you're gonna have is that you didn't sell more.csv,"Introduction Alright, so Nvidia is crazy overvalued right now. Just check out its P/E ratio – it's sitting at a whopping 73.94. And that's not all. Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.55, and the price-to-sales ratio is over 42. These numbers are way above what you typically see for tech stocks and the semiconductor industry. There are two big reasons why Nvidia's stock might take a hit: growing competition and lowered margins. Growing Competition First off, the competition is heating up big time. 🔥 AMD's MI300 series is a beast, merging CPU and GPU on the same chip, which is great for performance and energy efficiency. This is super important for data centers and AI applications, and it could seriously cut into Nvidia's market share. AMD is coming in hot, and Nvidia might end up feeling the burn. Then you've got Intel with their Gaudi3 GPU, which is packing some serious performance and efficiency for AI and machine learning tasks. More people might start switching to Intel's GPUs, giving Nvidia a run for its money. Intel's Gaudi3 could be the ghost in Nvidia's machine👻 Lowered Margins Then there's Amazon, which is throwing its hat into the ring with custom GPUs for their EC2 instances. These GPUs are optimized for machine learning and AI, and they integrate perfectly with Amazon's cloud services. This seamless integration could mean less reliance on Nvidia's products, pushing Nvidia to cut prices to stay competitive. Lower prices mean lower margins, which isn't great for Nvidia's bottom line. Amazon could very well turn Nvidia's margins into margin call memes. 📉 Adding to the heat, TSMC is thinking about jacking up production fees for Nvidia. The chairman's plans to raise prices could eat away at Nvidia's margins even more. If TSMC hikes those fees, Nvidia might have to dig deeper into their pockets, and that could be a real pain in the margins. 💸 Link (06/04) So yeah, Nvidia's stock might be flying high right now, but with all this competition and pressure on margins, it might not stay that way for long. It's looking like Nvidia might be headed from tendies to tears if they can't keep up. 😂 TL;DR Nvidia is trading high, but AMD, Intel, and Amazon are bringing the heat. 🔥 Competition + TSMC price hikes = potential margin squeeze. Stock might go from 🚀 to 💥 if they don't keep up. 😂",0.5456,NEGATIVE,0.9812
Nvidia's Blackwell Delay Offers Investors A Chance To 'Add To Positions' says Goldman Sachs.csv,"Nvidia Corp (NVDA) finds itself at the center of tech speculation as reports have surfaced about potential delays in its much-anticipated Blackwell architecture. With tech giants like Nvidia often facing the heat of public and market scrutiny, the slightest hiccup can stir investor unease. But is this delay really a cause for concern, or just a blip on Nvidia’s otherwise smooth journey towards AI supremacy? According to a report by The Information, Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell chips might hit a speed bump, delaying their release by over three months due to alleged design flaws. These chips were set to ship later this year, boasting promises of up to 30x better Inference performance over their predecessors. Despite this setback, Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs advises investors to remain calm and continue with their current strategies. The delay, while not ideal, is unlikely to impact Nvidia's 2025 earnings power or its market dominance, according to Hari. “We expect there to be little to no impact on CY2025 earnings and, most importantly, the company's long-term competitive position.” Hari believes that any short-term volatility in Nvidia's fundamentals will be just that—short-lived. The Market Reaction: Opportunity or Overreaction? For those ready to jump ship, Hari's advice is clear: stay the course. Nvidia's stock might experience some turbulence, but the company’s strong footing in the AI market isn't going anywhere. “We would consider any near-term dislocation in the stock as an opportunity to add to positions.” Despite a recent 15% correction, Nvidia remains a top pick, firmly seated on Goldman's Americas Conviction List with a 12-month price target of $135, suggesting a potential upside of nearly 26%. Even with Blackwell’s reported delays, Nvidia’s projected 39% year-over-year growth in 2025 remains unchanged. Hari’s bullish stance is rooted in Nvidia’s role as a crucial player in the rapidly evolving AI sector, especially as the demand for advanced AI infrastructure shows no signs of slowing down. Implications for Rival – AMD Interestingly, while the Blackwell delays might appear as a dark cloud over Nvidia, there could be a silver lining for competitors like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (AMD). “We believe the market could perceive this development as a marginal positive for AMD — the only alternative to Nvidia today in Data Center GPUs.” Although the analysts say AMD is unlikely to overtake Nvidia due to Nvidia’s strong market position and AMD’s challenges in scaling operations, this situation could still present a competitive boost for AMD. What’s Next for Nvidia? In the tech world, where speed and innovation reign supreme, a three-month delay might seem significant. However, Nvidia’s legacy of innovation and market leadership paints a different picture. As Hari points out, “any impact to CY2025 earnings will be negligible,” and the temporary setback should not deter investors from seeing Nvidia’s long-term value. For now, Nvidia’s strategy remains rock solid. The potential delay, whether factual or exaggerated, is but a temporary hurdle, according to Hari. As Nvidia navigates this challenge, the market watches closely, with many investors seeing a buying opportunity amid the noise. For those invested in Nvidia's future, Hari’s message is clear: hold steady, as the AI revolution waits for no one.",0.5505,NEGATIVE,0.9994
NVIDIA’s next catalyst has to be sovereign AI.csv,"NVIDIA’s current valuation is not overtly expensive (FPER: 33, PEG: 1.61 according to FINVIZ) and the GPU orders for next year are all booked. Yet the stock is meeting strong resistance around $130. I think this is partially because a lot of people have been burned by CISCO during dot-com bubble and do not want to price in the future too much. But the real concern is that their revenue is almost entirely dependent on the rest of M7 and they are charging the big tech 80 % margin. The big tech, while being hammered by Wall Street for the increased CAPEX spending, indicated during last earning that they will not reduce their investment on AI. However, they did mention that they are/plan using their NPU (Google TPU, Tesla Dojo, AMD) to reduce the usage of NVIDIA GPU. Furthermore, GPT5 and Apple Intelligence should be available to the public by the end of this year. If these do not impress, the entire AI sector may see significant slowdown. But if GPT5 shows plateauing of performance while people find Apple Intelligence interesting, paradigm could shift toward smaller models and inference efficiency, again reducing the demand for NVIDIA. To justify significant increase in NVIDIA’s stock price, they need to show that they are not entirely dependent on the Big Tech. The only other potential buyers that have as much buying power are governments. Also, if the economy is going through downturns, governments have excuse to increase their spending. What I am paying attention to during the earning call is demonstration from NVIDIA that they are receiving significant demand from non-Big Tech such as governments.",0.5529,NEGATIVE,0.9994

Short Call Strategy Am I Regarded or Might This Actually Work.csv,"Okay, so I'm guessing a good amount of us in this subreddit were new to options trading at some point in time, and when we were just itty bitty option noobs first hearing about them, we just thought: "" Wow! this is just the same thing as betting on stocks but with leverage right?"" (might just be me when I first got into options trading but whatever). Moving on. I assume that many people's first instinct was to go and buy a call on a stock they were very bullish on. And I would assume that once we did that, we lost the entire position because we never knew how theta decay, IV, DTE, strike price, and other factors could sink your entire position. The thing about these factors is that when you buy a call, the majority of these factors are stacked against you, and if you don't want them to be completely stacked against you, you gotta pay up for a higher premium which is gonna yield the same or less of a return then the lower priced (but considerably more risky) options. You're paying for less risk. Long Calls are usually only profitable when the underlying has a significant enough uptick to outweigh all the other factors dragging down the value of the option. I'm sorry I don't mean to repeat the basics of valuing options but I think it's important to pretext them a little bit so my strategy makes more sense in the grand scheme of things. Okay, so my strategy is as follows: why buy a call, and have all of these factors stacked against you, when you can sell one, and have them work in your favor; I guess the whole basis is: the shittier the call, the better (meaning how likely it is to expire or be exercised with no value). The even better thing is we can magnify the shittiness to work in our favor on the sell side by selling balls deep out of the money calls, with low IV, and few DTE. And we can magnify this even further by selling calls on options with really shitty stocks underlying; stocks that are down 40% YTD, or just really, really stagnant not moving anywhere (might also get some sexy low IV to work in your favor there too). I don't really have any stocks in mind right now to lock this trade in off the top of my head, but $NOC and $AMD are quite down this last month and a half, and are relatively popular stocks. Like I said I need to find some better stocks for this Strat; these are not the ones I wanna go with, just what I thought of off the top of my head Now you might be saying two things: 1. ""The prices on them are probably gonna be pennies on the dollar. Sure the odds might be in your favor, but the yield is gonna be very low"", and 2. ""What fucking moron is gonna be stupid enough to buy these calls?"". To answer question 1: Why not just sell more calls? And to answer question 2: I don't think I need to illustrate the stupidity of individuals in the market, but if you need me to, here you go: WSB regards (not dissing, I am also a WSB regard who has lost thousands on YOLOs), teenagers with a Robinhood account that just found out about options, and maybe even people who are legit investors, but have bought the call as a part of some bigger options play, like a straddle, or iron condor (not to mention that in the example of the straddle, I don't think they would really give a shit if the call tanked because, well, it's a straddle lol, the put on the other side would cover the losses and make profit{and yeah there are probably more plays where this is the case that I am just forgetting about, but this is the example I'm just gonna go with for now}). Not to mention markets are huge and I've checked the open interest on some of these calls and there are hundreds going up to the thousands in open interest on balls deep OTM, 2DTE, Low IV call options. Anyways, I guess the reason I made this post is to double check with some options veteran (I've been into options for a little less than a year, but I have some knowledge on them from my job) to see if this strategy is complete delusional manic retardation, or if there is actually some substance to it. I wanna make sure there isn't some variable or factor I'm not accounting for that could tank this entire play.

Starting on Tuesday, October 15th 2024, the Open Compute Project (OCP) global summit takes place in San Jose, California. Between 9 AM and 11:30 AM there'll be short keynotes (each 12 mins) presented by Meta, NVidia, AI Clusters, Intel, AMD, Microsoft and Google (full schedule here). Now, I don't think that there'll be any big surprises. But the Summit still presents an opportunity for public remarks about how strong the demand is or what so ever. Also, there's an article that says that Broadcom (AVGO) is going to show case cutting-edge AI infrastructure. Further it is expected that Taiwan Semiconductor Company (TSM) and ASML Holding (ASML) will publish their Q3 earnings next week. TSM will present its earnings on October 17th 2024 at 14:00 Taiwan time / 02:00 Eastern Time. So pre-market movements will most likely be wild on Thursday as a large part of the industry relies on TSM. If TSM reports a great Q3 revenue, this could push Nvidia over the current all time high. Also according to Moore's law is dead, the first RTX 5000 series GPUs are ready to be sold, but are not released because of business reasons (here at 22:22). So they could still change their mind and ship in Q4. Next, it is rumored (by moore's law is dead) that AMD will release a new CPU by the end of October or early November, the 9800X3D which is an 8 Core Gaming CPU with 3D cache and it is expected that it will be the fastest gaming CPU releasing this year. Although Client is not as important for AMD, it will still be beneficial to have this CPU released before the holiday season. Especially since Zen5 Rysen has so far been viewed as rather disappointing. Moore's law is dead also mentions an RX 7650 GRE GPU, which could launch alongside Ryzen 9800X3D. Releasing a slightly refreshed and cheap RDNA3 GPU could be a good move by AMD to get rid of RDNA3 stock ahead of the RDNA4 launch in 2025. Since the Ryzen 9800X3D has not yet been anounced, I don't think that it has been priced in and could give the stock a slight boost to recover from the -4% last Thursday. Also, I although Investors were not excited about AMDs Advancing AI event, I think AMDs position in the market is still solid. According to the slides shown at the event, AMD Epic has increased its market share to 34%. And according to tests AMD Epyc Turin obliterates Xeon 6 Granite Rapids, while being cheaper. Because of this, I think AMD is in a good position to gain more server market share. Further, the news about Nvidia Blackwell being sold out for the next 12 Months is not only good news for Nvidia but also for AMD. Sure, everyone wants blackwell. but if one can't get blackwell and if AMD Instinct MI325X is faster than Nvidia Hopper (H200), then they might be able to win over customers from nvidia, who would like to buy blackwell but can't in due time. Also, AMDs earnings should be reported on October 29 2024. Due to Ryzen Zen5 being disappointing and there being apparently a large RDNA3 stock remaining. If AMDs Instinct systems are selling well, this would also be good news for Micron Industries (MU), which produces high bandwith memory (HBM3e). And then there's Intel.

They buy YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, so they can skip the ads of their fellow influencers (GOOGL) They spent most of their waking hours at META's Instagram website. They drive a TSLA or RIVN. They're on the GLP-1 drug (LLY) to impress their SOs. They're churning their credit cards with AXP Platinum and Gold, JPM's Chase Sapphire Preffered (no, NOT Reserve), some younger ones need to rely on COF's Venture and Venture X cards that gave nice ""subs"". They use these cards frequently to eat out and earn those points at CMG, SHAK and SG. They're flying a lot on DAL, and they need their free wifi that is often sponsored by their preferred choice of mobile carrier, TMUS. To get to the airport they need to use UBER or LYFT, since they don't want to drive their sweet electric ride. When they arrive at their destination airport, they pick up their rental car, and of course they prefer AVIS (CAR), but their credit cards give them presential circle status on HTZ, so they are ok with that too. They check into their hotel room at Marriott (MAR) to impress their friends, but really they are using all their Chase points to book Hyatt (H) hotels. The slightly less premium young ones will have to go Hilton (HLT) and fly on UAL. They often booked all this travel on EXPE or BKNG. Sometimes they use ABNB. When they check in they need to get some food, so they use their DASH gift card they bought at COST every two weeks because they get 20% off. When they go to Vegas, they prefer to stay in WYNN, because it's where all the hot ones stay. After they're done with their holidaying which they do basically 4 months out of the year, they're going to ULTA or LULU to buy their beauty products or Khakis. They are drop shipping on SHOP and sometimes they need to use ZM to conduct ""business"" for their ""coaching classes"" that they teach. A lot of times they get paid using Venmo (PYPL). Whatever money they make, they buy call options on HOOD. At the end of the day their sugar daddy's give them a $1m deposit so they can buy those nice suburban homes built by TOL and furnished by WSM. And of course, they spend their entire day on RDDT.",0.5223,POSITIVE,0.9956
"The next tech giant Why HOOD, PLTR and DKNG are the investment opportunities of a lifetime (Part 1).csv","I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong. $AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice. $NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were. And so in true wsb fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB. There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long. From a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about. And so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry : If you are under 40 years old, $HOOD (Finance), $PLTR (Defense) and $DKNG (gambling) will 100x during your investment horizon.

The short report for Intel (INTC) - A rabbit hole of CPU failures rate since 2022.csv,"Forenote: Im a technical person, A developer, this will be a technical DD to show how intel is failing to do their basic business model of manufacturing CPUs. Over the past month or so Intels customers have been becoming increasing irrate about CPUs just flat out dying after various finger pointing from Intel being debunked. I first caught wind of intels failures when a friends system started to become unstable, he would crash in games and sometimes doing mundane tasks. It all came to a clicking point when his systems files started becoming corrupted and he needed to attempt reinstalling windows. The attempts failed, windows couldnt even install without corrupted files, sometimes it would install and look fine, but running a verification shows that various system files were still corrupted but not important enough for the system to boot successfully. He would still get various crashes doing mundane things and gaming. It was basically a working brick at this point. So i got my research hat on, and discovered various reddit users on r/pcmasterrace were also reporting instability with their PCs. Not alot tho, this has been the wierd thing, Intel has such a large CPU failure rate, but not alot of reports which caught everyone by suprise. It started to make sense, the causes of the crashes were different for everything. Users were reporting issues with Nvidia, Issues with RAM, and issues with corrupted data. Obviously to any layman, these issues dont instantly point to an issue with the CPU. With GPU errors, Nvidia initially got heat, but Nvidia quickly debunked the issue reporting the GPUs that were returned were fully functional and had no issues. So I pulled out my handy dandy debug tools since my friend managed to get windows installed and it kinda runs. The first tests I ran were memory block verification. This validates that the memory is able to hold data immutably, after 4 hours the tests finished all green, the memory was stable and wasnt corrupting data. (its worth noting that the memory test software I used was very CPU lite so the CPU has little chance to corrupt the data its self, this is a stark difference to the Drive tests I ran.). Since my friend was getting corrupted files almost everytime he install anything, I ran the disk debug tools, these pull the S.M.A.R.T data from the drive and run various read and write tests. The S.M.A.R.T data came back green, the drive was reporting it had no errors or irregularies and was functioning fine, So i moved to the read and write tests, all red, the drive had a 90% file currption rate, I pulled the S.M.A.R.T data again, All green, the drive was still reporting it was functioning correctly. At this point, anyone would deduce they had a bad drive that was misbehaving, leading to the decreased number of CPU failure reports. After all, How can you say the CPU is bad when you have corrupt files? Many people forget how much the CPU is responsable for. When you read files or write files, its the CPU that tells the Drive what to store and where and what to read and where it is on the disk to read it from. and as i said, the software I used to test the drives is CPU intensive, it uses the the CPU to generate random data to store on the drive and hashes that data to verify it. So a bad CPU = Currupted data on the drive. Luckly my friend has 4 drives, So I told him to take out the ""bad"" drive and put in another one, I ran all my tests again and same result, the drive was reporting it was functional, but all the data was corrupted. The result was the same with all the drives tested. Now, this is a luxary many people dont have. Many people would get corrupted data on their drive and think the drive is dying and get a new one. However with 4 tests samples all failing the same way when days ago they were all fine is a very low chance. Now for the kicker, Intel has a tool to verify that the Intel CPU you have is a genuine Intel CPU, I guess intel has a problem of china making fake intel CPUs??? Ive never seen any but what the hell, its a useful tools since its does some basic CPU level checks. So i ran the verifier tool and its first test for a genuine CPU comes back green, Cool, it is a real Intel CPU. Memory test comes back green (We alreadt tested this soo good), next was the Graphics tests. Failed, the CPU was attempting to send data to the GPU and it corrupted the GPU memory. So now we have 2 symptoms. Disk data corruption GPU memory corruption My friend has Nvidia GPU and Nvidia previously debunked any issues with their GPUs. But we have a common cause, Intel CPUs are corrupting data when sending it to another device in the system (except RAM), Data sent to a disk gets corrupted and data sent to the GPU gets corrupted, which would explain the game crashes. Various other tests passed from boost speed changing, Wifi tests and math operations. After I finished all the tests and determed the issue is with the CPU, my friend RMA'd the CPU. This is where more troubles start. Intel refused the RMA, citing user damage, According to intel all the issues my friend was having was his fault and he caused the damage, After it was refused, I filed the RMA for him, to the same response, but because im a stickler I pushed for more info, Intel was refusing the RMA because of overclocking done by the motherboard. This is a previous blame game intel played, they were blaming Motherboards for putting in stock overclocks on CPUs causing them to fail, but this wasnt the case with my friend, his motherboard wasnt even stock overclocked, but intel refused it anyway. After this point is when the waterfall started coming down, a advanced tech-youtuber posted an exposé about intels CPU failures. See: Intel has a HUGE problem - Level1Tech the curtains were starting to fall, Apparently Game developers and datacenters (Intels BIGGEST customers) were getting large amounts of CPU failures specificly with intel CPUs. Now datacenters are normally quiet about this type of thing, opting to sort their issues directly with intel, but intel is turning away datacenters RMA's of thousands of CPUs, these datacenters has since publicly reported they are dropping intel systems from their products and only supporting AMD systems from now on. Intel has lost their largest customer base, because of their defective products and refusing to take responsability for the product inherit flaw. Intel is hoping this goes unnoticed, since reports are still low of CPUs failing because the errors are random and different each time and users dont know their CPU is defective, there isnt a big in your face ""The Intel CPU in this system has errored"" its always an error with something else, which is caused by the CPU. So intel is betting on customers blaming other manufactures like they did with Nvidia when this all started. Timeline of events: [Dec 2022] The first instances of ""Out of Video Memory"" issues on 13th Gen Core i9 CPUs were reported back in 2022. (Source: Reddit). This is a few months after the release of Intel's 13th Gen CPUs & RTX 40 GPUs. [Throughout 2023] Several users have started reporting game crashes and issues in high-profile AAA titles such as Callisto Protocol and Hogwarts Legacy (among many others). Both tiles are based on Unreal Engine (released in 2023) and feature a shader compilation process at the start. There are currently thousands of such issues reported on Steam Community Forums and Reddit. [February 2024] A post by Sebastian Castellanos brings the issue to the limelight, highlighting the ""worrying trend"" of stability issues affecting 14th and 13th-gen CPUs. [February 2024] Our editor along with various other tech outlets start reporting the issue and bringing the matter on to the mainstream media. Quickly, it is pointed out that underclocking and undervolting the chips can result in better stability. [April 2024] NVIDIA Issued a formal statement that the stability issues are not related to its GPUs but rather Intel CPUs. [April 2024] Intel announces its investigation of the reports of instability issues affecting 13th and 14th Gen CPUs. [April 2024] Oodle Publishes about their discovery about users Intel systems experiencing data corruption. [April 2024] Motherboard makers quickly roll out ""Baseline"" power profiles in new BIOS, which lower power limits on high-end 14th & 13th Gen CPUs but also lead to significant performance drops. [May 2024] Intel releases a statement, recommending motherboard makers to ship ""Intel Default Settings"" in BIOS by default rather than customized settings. [June 2024] Intel discovers a bug within its eTVB microcode while investigating the root cause of 14th and 13th Gen Instability issues. This doesn't fix the instability problems. Board makers quickly roll out BIOS with a new microcode fix. [June 2024] Alderon Games publishes about there players, developers and servers Intel CPUs failing over a period of months and switch to only AMD systems. [July 2024] Intel denies an RMA to HardwareTimes editor who already RMA'd at least two CPUs which produced instability issues. [July 2024] Wendell from Level1Techs & Steve Burke from GamersNexus are the first big tech media outlets on YouTube to further highlight the instability issues, diving into additional details such as OEM frustration with the matter and a possible recall. [July 2024] GamersNexus highlights a potential ""oxidation"" defect being a problem with a certain batch of Intel 14th & 13th Gen CPUs that might lead to instability problems. [July 2024] Intel says the 14th & 13th Gen Mobile CPUs are not affected by the same instability issues as the desktop CPUs. [July 2024] GamersNexus reports they will not be recommending Intel CPUs regardless of the outcome for upcoming AMD 9000 series reviews [July 2024] Intel issues a statement confirming that they have found the root cause of the instability issues which happen to be elevated operating voltages and will be issuing a new microcode fix to its partners by mid of August [July 2024] Users are reporting instability issues with Intel 14th gen Laptop CPUs. [July 2024] ModelFarm (A movie VFX studio) publishes their Intel systems expereinced a 50% failure rate and they are moving all systems to AMD [July 2024] Intel announces the Microcode update they pushed does not fix the issues and will not be accepting RMA's or doing a recall for effected CPUs I have been short Intel since July 15th. Edit: Ive received internal leaks from Intel employees explaining internal issues and intels failures. Source 1: The leading theory inside Intel right now, and it is just a theory, is that the Ring Bus is getting cooked because it's fed by the same rail as the P-Cores and E-Cores. Raptor Lake required incredibly high voltages that the clocks required to be competitive with Zen 4, and it seems like it was just pushed too hard. This is an inherent flaw that would be in Bartlett too it's overvolted. Meteor Lake isn't affected, and Emerald Rapids is unlikely be effected materially. Source 2: I never worked directly on Raptor Lake [Intel Design Engineer], but I did have exposure to Alder Lake, and I can confirm that they were very concerned about the ring bus getting damaged if the voltage was pushed too high. I can also confirm that Raptor Lake was rushed through the design and validation process... Source 3: I [Intel Foundry Services] can tell you that Raptor Lake was rushed through our Fab in Arizona in record time, but it's also produced in other fabs. However, this location (Arizona) is notable because I can confirm that there was an Oxidation issue caused by some failure in our HVAC system between March & June of 2023. It was so bad that Keyvan Esfarjani had to fly in to make decision about which wafers (which cost as much as a Model X each) needed to be thrown away. To be clear, I don't know what decision was made, but I do know that this event DID happen. And by the way, it affected Sapphire Rapids yields as well...although I doubt it's an issue that wasn't",0.5221,NEGATIVE,0.9929

RMA's are not cheap and the amount of money and time they are spending to fix the issue for existing chips while trying their hardest to deny RMAs for failed CPUs. Customers have lost faith in Intel, their chips are constantly beaten by AMD offerings and having a high failure rate really was the last nail in the coffin.

VSH - The Forgotten King of Chips.csv,"TLDR: $VSH (Vishay Intertechnology) is printing money while everyone sleeps on it. $VSH just got the stamp of approval from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, confirming it as a hidden winner in Nvidia’s AI and RTX 50 supply chain. With key wins in MOSFETs, capacitors, and resistors, $VSH is now primed for explosive growth, riding Nvidia’s dominance in AI servers and GPUs. If you’re not jacked up on $VSH, you’re not meant to have money. Who is $VSH? Vishay Intertechnology is a veteran in the electronics industry. They make essential components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and semiconductors. You know, the boring stuff that makes your GPU, PS5, and electric toothbrush actually work. They’ve been doing this since 1962. That’s right, this company has survived every market downturn, bubble, and chip shortage in the last 60+ years. Meanwhile, you can’t even survive a red day on SPY. Why $VSH is printing money: Chips are everywhere—cars, phones, smart homes, AI servers. The global semiconductor market is growing at an insane pace (projected $1 trillion market by 2030). Guess what? Vishay is supplying the guts. Look at their P/E ratio: 12.5 (as of last check). Compare that to Nvidia’s 75+ or AMD’s 30-ish. $VSH is practically trading at the bargain bin, and yet their revenues are consistently strong. Vishay’s last earnings report crushed expectations, with double-digit growth in several segments. They’re sitting on $3.4B in annual revenue with plans to scale. Oh, and they’re buying back shares like they’re on clearance at Costco. Everyone’s hyped about Nvidia because of AI. Guess what? Vishay supplies components used in AI hardware, EV charging stations, and industrial automation. While Nvidia makes the sexy GPUs, Vishay sells the boring but essential resistors and capacitors that keep those GPUs from melting your motherboard. They’re eating up the market share. Recent Catalysts: Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo dropped a bombshell: Vishay is a key supplier for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI servers (GB200 series, DGX/HGX B200) and the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. These are Nvidia’s future bread-and-butter products, dominating AI and high-end gaming. Vishay replaced Infineon as Nvidia’s MOSFET supplier. Yes, Infineon, the semiconductor giant, just got sidelined. This Is MASSIVE for $VSH. Vishay is providing MOSFET/DrMOS (VRPower), vPolyTan (Polymer Tantalum Capacitors), and Current Shunt Resistors. These components are critical for Nvidia’s most cutting-edge products: • GB200 series AI servers: Nvidia’s next-gen AI infrastructure. • RTX 50 series GPUs: The next flagship graphics cards. Vishay’s vPolyTan capacitors (especially the T55 series) are already facing a supply crunch for 2025. That’s how in-demand they are. Kuo estimates that Vishay’s MOSFET production alone will contribute 20%-30% of revenue by 2025—with above-average gross profit margins. The vPolyTan capacitors will add a high single-digit percentage of revenue with significantly above-average margins. Translation? Vishay is printing money. Vishay’s production lines are already at capacity through 2025. When your biggest challenge is meeting demand, you’re in a good spot. Beyond Nvidia, Vishay is also poised to benefit from: • Automotive rebound: As EV production scales, Vishay’s components are critical. • IoT growth: Billions of devices mean billions of tiny components. Vishay is at the center of it. The Stock Is Still Cheap Even after today’s 7% jump to $18.35, $VSH is wildly undervalued. As I said earlier, the P/E ratio is still around 12-13, compared to Nvidia’s 75+. This is a company with real earnings, real dividends, and real growth potential. This is a great opportunity to make back everything you lost from your MSTR calls. Positions: Shares, 01/17/25 20C",0.5352,POSITIVE,0.9824

"Weekly jobless claims fall to 233,000, less than expected, in a positive sign for labor market.csv","Last night, the U.S. announced that the number of initial unemployment claims for last week was 233,000, significantly lower than the previous week's 249,000 and also below the market's expectation of 240,000! A few days ago, Mr. Wang mentioned that for the U.S. stock market to stop declining, the economic and labor data released must continue to be strong in order to ease concerns about a potential economic recession. Yesterday's sharp drop in initial unemployment claims marked the largest decrease in a year, indicating that the number of people recently unemployed has decreased. This alleviated the recession concerns raised by last Friday's non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate data, spurring a rally in U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 index surging over 2.3%, the largest single-day gain in 21 months 📈. On the other hand, the demand for the 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds at the auctions over the past two days was poor, causing the 10-year yield to exceed 4% once again! Tech giants saw a broad rebound, with Meta rising 4.2%, Alphabet up 1.9%, Amazon gaining 1.8%, Apple increasing 1.6%, and Microsoft rebounding 1%. Nvidia surged over 6%, returning to the $100 mark, leading to a rebound in semiconductor stocks. Broadcom, Micron, and Applied Materials all jumped more than 6%, while Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and AMD all saw gains of over 5%! Taiwan's ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) also rebounded, with TSMC and UMC both jumping more than 6%, and ASE gaining over 4%. However, it's still important to note that the number of continuing unemployment claims is rising, reaching its highest level since November 2021, nearly three years ago! Therefore, Wall Street's foreign investors remain concerned about the economy. For example, JPMorgan still believes the U.S. economy will enter a recession, raising the probability from 25% to 35%! This echoes Goldman Sachs' recent increase in the U.S. recession probability, from 15% to 25%⬆️. https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/08/weekly-jobless-claims-fall-to-233000-less-than-expected-in-a-positive-sign-for-labor-market.html",0.5401,NEGATIVE,0.9985

Why I am going long on Intel and letting Bad Daddy Gelsinger take me to Uranus - DD TurboNerd Post.csv,"TLDR: This stock fucking sucks, and I love it. But the developing foundry business is gonna get absolutely bananas under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for the sole purpose of developing it. They are not gonna let the other chip companies continue to take nut shots on them and they are just gonna make everyone chips for them. Anyways I all in on Mar 2025 Calls (which are like $4.50 - $5.00) right now. Here is some DD. Dog of the Dow Intel has lagged behind other chip titans such as [[AMD - AMD]] and [[NVDA -NVIDIA]] as they race to design and build chips to handle [[AI]] workloads. Both AMD and NVIDA have seen tremendous growth over the past 18 months (as of June 2024). A growth pattern that has gone completely unanswered by INTEL up until this point. Looking at the [[Price to Earnings Ratio]] of both AMD and NVIDIA it is easy to see how disconnected from earnings they have become (though they are both incredibly profitable). AMD P/E Ratio: 67.30 NVIDIA P/E Ratio: 238.53 INTEL P/E Ratio 31.79 AMD is wildly inflated relative to its competition in the space. NVDA is has a more ""sane"" price to earnings but it has also been nearly printing its own money with the amount of sales it has been making. The price of NVIDIA still ""feels"" high despite it's recent split. Another interesting metric to take a look at is the [[Price/Tangible Book]] - Where you take the current price of the stock and compare it to the tangle value of all its assets minus good will. AMD P/TB Ratio: 23.61 NVIDIA P/TB Ratio: 64.73 INTEL P/TB Ratio: 1.75 This says a few things; One either Intel has barely any assets worth liquidating relative to its stock price and the market has priced the stock appropriately, OR the price of the stock is selling for a very reasonable price related to the actual value of the company. This could be considered paying only .75 above book value of the company as a ""premium"" for future expected value. Source: Any trading platform that has data you ding dongs - go look it up. I got these from Schwab jfc. Technical Except for this past Wednesday, this company has been hard stuck around $30 after a selloff from its 52 week high of $51.28. 31.50 appears to be the most reliable resistance level we can work off of right now, then $32.50 after that. If it breaks both of those on a run up, there is literally no ceiling until $46. SO, you tell me what that means. The further you zoom out on your shitty little trading app the more you will see that this period we are in is nothing but consolidation. Foundry Intel's new foundry business will be the corner stone of its future growth. Forget the in house made chips. The company is not-so-silently tyring to be the American version of TSMC. Here is an article they posted on their own site outlining their model. https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-outlines-new-financial-reporting-structure.html#gs.a8z07s Note this section: April 9th 2024 ""Intel Foundry is a newly established operating segment that includes foundry technology development, foundry manufacturing and supply chain, and foundry services (formerly IFS). Under this new structure, Intel Foundry will recognize revenues generated from both external foundry customers and Intel Products..."" Fuck me, if they pull this off under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for this specific function, this stock could easily moon. Not to mention this article detailing that NVIDIA will start using Intels Foundry to start making its own chips. https://www.techspot.com/news/101725-nvidia-turning-intel-foundry-services-expand-gpu-ai.html#:~:text=Nvidia%20could%20also%20choose%20to,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202024. Chips Act ""U.S. Department of Commerce has proposed up to $8.5 billion in direct funding through the CHIPS and Science Act to advance Intel’s commercial semiconductor projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon. Intel also expects to benefit from a U.S. Treasury Department Investment Tax Credit (ITC) of up to 25% on more than $100 billion in qualified investments and eligibility for federal loans up to $11 billion. Proposed funding supports Intel’s previously announced plans to invest more than $100 billion in the U.S. over five years to expand U.S. chipmaking capacity and capabilities critical to economic and national security and acceleration of emerging technologies, such as AI. Intel’s investments are expected to create more than 10,000 company jobs and nearly 20,000 construction jobs, and to support more than 50,000 indirect jobs with suppliers and supporting industries. "" https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/us-chips-act-intel-direct-funding.html#gs.a8z5ze So yea Intel is gonna get paid, and quite a bit. The article states that they are slated to receive up to $8.5 billion, with a B. X86 chips - Speculation With Arm taking dominance over portable computers like laptops, tablets and phones, X86 looks pretty boring. Except you have to remember that both AMD and Intel are still cranking these bad boys out like nobody's business. The raw horsepower in these for desktop workstations and servers is still not matched by ARM and probably wont be for quite a while. Sure they are not quite as power efficient, but who cares in a data center or major compute space anyways. Intel owns almost all of the IP for X86 processors too. AMD has a little bit and they have made improvements and designs of their own that they have been able to patent, but INTEL is the OG maker of these chips. Arm will probably continue to dominate the landscape, but they are the people who license their chips are going to need them made somewhere. They will have like two options. Intel or TSMC. China What happens when CHYNA pulls the trigger and takes over Taiwan. Where is everyone gonna have their chips made? Arizona, that's where. TSMC and Intel are both setting up MASSIVE Fabs there. So, when all the other chip companies get absolutely smoked I expect to see a giant green candle on that morning for INTC. I will probably write more later but this shit got way long way fast.

Why I bought Puts on MNST (Monster).csv,"Since Monster releases its earnings report after market, it’s time for some puts… or calls if you are based and want to inverse me Reason 1: High expectations - Current expectations for this quarterly are quite high.. Expected earnings per share are $0.452 as opposed to the $0.400 of a year ago . In this same light the market expects (has already priced in) a nearly 200 million dollar increase in revenue from the year prior.. Put quite simply these massive increases are already expected and priced in, and it’s much easier to fall short when expectations are this high Reason 2: Competition - PepsiCo is fighting hard for market share of the energy drink market and threw $550 million dollars for an 8.5% share of Celsius in 2022. Monster has already struggled to maintain market share versus Red Bull, which owns the largest portion of the energy drink market.. Now on top of this already stiff competition they have to deal with a whale like PepsiCo flooding the market with products like Rockstar and Celsius over time Reason 3: regulation- As more health focused initiatives take place in Europe and America, products like monster will face increased scrutiny, both from consumers and governments alike (regulations on certain contents). Reason 4: Even those who hit their goals have been getting smashed… AMD and Reddit- Now I get what you are thinking “what the heck do these companies have to do with monster”… and yea they have no direct relationship.. But even after surpassing their goals for this last quarter these companies have seen their value get smashed.. The market is being mad weird and bearish right now when it comes to earnings. So in essence this combined with reason 1 (the high goals they already have), means that I feel that the odds favor the Put/bear side Hope you enjoyed my presentation!!

"Why I think Intel is a Misunderstood, Undervalued Play – A Bet on 18A (+EV DD).csv","Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.",0.5307,NEGATIVE,0.9997
Why Intel is the most undervalued tech stock right now.csv,"Intel ($INTC) is an insane bargain right now, as it is trading at year 1999 stock price. Every other comparable tech stock is up 5000%-20000% since then. People are too focused on Intel consumer and data center products, which by the way are improving at impressive rate. Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3). Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD & NVIDIA offerings. But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment. Currently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons. Microsoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in.

I don't do options so maybe this is the wrong place lmao. I moved back home to my parents place when my dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Truthfully this has been the worst year of my life (and his obviously) in a lot of ways, but I've been investing since I was 16 (I'm 25 now). My dad worked in equities, so when he lost his ability to communicate effectively with me (and since I had significantly more income because I'm not paying rent) - I truthfully went ballistic on investing. Pretty much said fuck it, I'm living at home I don't need a 6 month emergency fund till I move out and went all-in. Granted 40% of my portfolio not listed here is in a 401k account entirely in the S&P 500 (set & forget just in case my equities went to hell as with the rest of my life lol). I believe in the margin of safety when investing. I like to invest in high-quality companies that generate lots of cash as the backbone of my portfolio. Since 2021 (before my dad got this cancer shit), I spoke with him and he basically said just look at the fundamentals of a company and invest in growth companies that you think will be around in 5-10 years. I look for value within growth stocks (i know paradoxical). Some of my icons in investing are David Tepper & Michael Burry. Again below is all my own experience and reflects only my own views and are not a recommendation of my company (corporate. disclaimer). My portfolio is heavily weighted (85%) between several stocks: AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL (So fucking cheap r u kidding me sorry), NVDA, AMZN, AMD, CRM, COST, RIVN (RIP), AVGO, VOO (ik not a stock) <-- I know semi(s) are very cyclical but i believe in holding all of these companies for 5-10 years, so I don't have to worry about temp. earnings beats/misses etc. Much easier to pick a stock and hold it for a while then it is to get the timing right. Roughly at 175% return in the past 3 years. (hammered META at $100's, NVDA at $200 both in 2022) Roughly 15% of my bets are moonshots (note the word bet hehe) with promise but objectively could be overvalued/bad investments: CCL/RCL (both are crushing it and between them own 75% of the cruise line market), LCID/RIVN (going to 0 bc they can't scale profitably or will make u a very happy person 3 years down the line bc R2/Atlas at 45k/50k should capture a significant portion of model y demand), TTD, DKNG/FLUT - gambling hasn't even been legalized in Cali/Texas (the biggest markets in the U.S. come on), RBLX (feels like betting against youtube in the early innings w/o realizing how much rev. they're actually recognizing), PYPL (value - cheap af (bought at $60) should turn around in a couple years) I joke I allocate like google's budget where it's 90% bread&butter and the rest are moonshots.

AI chipmaker Cerebras files for IPO to take on Nvidia - But 87% of its revenues have come from the U.csv,"The Middle East wants chips badly but US restrictions prevent the US most powerful chips entering into certain geographical areas such as China and the Middle East; this entails the UAE. Nevertheless, the UAE wants in on the GPU chips craze and is apparently willing to pay anything to enter into the chip bonanza. The UAE can't get Nvidia's, AMD's, or Intel's best GPU chips so instead they are investing heavily into alternatives such as Cerebras. There is nothing inherently wrong with this but it's also the biggest red flag as an investment opportunity. If the agreements for Nvidia chips open up in the Middle East and specifically with the UAE that could be a crushing blow to this aspiring startup. Specifically, Cerebras Systems reported a net loss of $66.6 million for the first six months of 2024, on $136.4 million in revenue. For the same period in 2023 it has a net loss of $77.8 million on just $8.7 million in sales. 87% of this revenue for the first half of 2024 was directly from the UAE G42. The other red flag from this startup is the way in which they promote their business. It's all seemingly smoke and mirrors and conveniently based on outdated GPU pricing and throughput information; which is very publically available. For some reason, Groq and Cerebras love to keep using memory to unlock speeds on small/tiny models which is impractical and inefficient for a scaled system; or a system that is a large foundational LLM. As well, they have no clue what models will do next so it's a major after the fact architecture that uses llama because they have access to it. https://cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebras-inference-ai-at-instant-speed. A prime example of this is OpenAI's GPT-o1 model that uses reasoning in coordination with its model capabilities. Because they are not being used on the forefront of this technology they don't know how or when a model's size, function, or needs will evolve into the future. All of this plus the pricing from OpenAI and Microsoft is coming down exponentially. For Example: They are referring to a 70b param model that shoves an entire model onto memory. They are going up against h100's which is a very old technology at this point. They make no reference to h200's let alone blackwell Because they are referencing such a small model the pricing model they suggest would be radically different for a 400b param model and forget about trillion param models which are coming next. They're not being truthful about tokens per s. As of today this is Azure GPT 4o and GPT 4 mini tokens per minute gpt-4o & GPT-4 Turbo global standard Model Tier Quota Limit in tokens per minute (TPM) Requests per minute gpt-4o Enterprise agreement 30 M 180 K gpt-4o-mini Enterprise agreement 50 M 300 As you can clearly see 30 million tokens per minute is 500k tokens per second and mini is 833,333 tokens per second. So i don't know why they are referring to 20 tokens per second or their 450 tokens per second seems way off. maybe they mean million. Even if that is the case and 70 b would be more like mini it is way higher than their limit. On pricing which they lay out a 3:1 input versus output is fine the price would be for mini which is a comparable model is roughly .10 cents (input) + .20 cents = .30 cents. Per million. for regular 4o it would be higher and let's face it GPT 4o is a far superior model than llama 3.1 3.33 dollar + 5 = $8.33 Source: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/ From this information what I can tell you is that what we just went over is pricing. it is not some guarantee for what a model produces per second. That shit is very random. What I can tell you is from GPT 4 to GPT 4 turbo to Gpt 4o the speed is dramatically better. GPT 4o mini is damn near real time. Take that for what it's worth. I am not saying they're being dishonest here but I am saying they are being very cheeky with how they advertise things. The company is currently being primarily supported by the UAE, with investments worth roughly $900 million for new AI supercomputers known as the Condor Galaxy series. Any growth here is singular to this source of investment and not driven by organic growth or usage. This is not a competitor to Nvidia but rather a temporary solution in the Middle East until chip embargoes are alleviated. The media here loves to use sexy headlines on non-technical verifications of what it is they are actually comparing. I.e. H100's are now old, or The fact an entity may need to serve millions of clients... No they are instead reporting self-prompting headlines from Cerebras that say things like our chips are 20x faster than Nvidia. Live Update: As I am writing and researching this topic it has just been reported by Reuters that the U.S. is setting a new rule to allow chip shipments to the Middle East including the UAE which is a boon to Nvidia and Microsoft. US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East Here are couple excerpts: WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), to data centers in the Middle East. G42, a UAE-based AI company with historic ties to China, has been a focus of those concerns. In April, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), opens new tab announced that it would invest $1.5 billion in the company, with plans to provide G42 with chips and model weights, sophisticated data that improves an AI model's ability to emulate human reasoning.The deal drew scrutiny from China hardliners in Congress, even though G42 said in February that it had divested from China and was accepting constraints imposed on it by the United States to work with American companies. LOL you can't make this up. Literally this just got reported by Reuters today 9/30/2024. This completely aligns with my argument above regarding the UAE-G42. With chips now entering into the Middle East from Nvidia and potentially others I don't know how this startup IPO makes it off the ground. I don't mean to be bearish but I don't think this is the time for them to raise an IPO without showing more progress. I could be wrong. As of now, I don't plan on buying any shares. Instead, I will be adding more shares into Nvidia because now this is bullish news for Nvidia.",0.5441,NEGATIVE,1.0

AMD CEO Lisa Su Says AI Is In Early Stages Of Multiyear 'Supercycle' 'There's Tremendous Need For Mo.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) shares are experiencing an upward trend after the company reported strong second-quarter financial results. Following the announcement, CEO Lisa Su emphasized that the chipmaker’s performance is being driven by a multiyear AI “supercycle.” What To Know: Recently, chip stocks saw a sell-off as earnings season approached, with investors questioning the timeline for significant returns on the massive investments in AI. This led to speculation that spending on AI might slow down. However, early earnings reports indicate that capital expenditures have remained robust. Su’s comments on CNBC’s “Squawk On The Street” Wednesday provide reassurance against slowdown concerns. She stated, “From the conversations that I have with our customer set and sort of the broader industry, we can see that AI is a multiyear, you know, I would call it a supercycle frankly. There’s tremendous need for more compute.” AMD reported second-quarter revenue of $5.835 billion and adjusted earnings of 69 cents per share, surpassing analyst estimates as its AI business continues to see accelerating demand. The chipmaker also updated its forecast, expecting GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion this year, up from the previous forecast of more than $4 billion. Su highlighted that analysts and investors are “hypersensitive” to minor quarter-over-quarter changes. She believes that the AI story should be viewed in a broader context, suggesting that the demand is extraordinarily high. “I wouldn’t be hypersensitive in those areas ... Are more customers using it? Is every enterprise asking for it? Are we seeing more applications on a daily, weekly, monthly basis? The answer to that is absolutely yes,” she said. “Everywhere I go, everyone wants to talk about how can we incorporate AI into our businesses faster and more efficiently ... this early in the cycle, there’s a lot of learning and experimentation, but definitely, there will be the return on the investment on the other side,” Su added. Although the return on investment isn’t “instantaneous,” it’s occurring very quickly. AI is already boosting productivity and enabling companies to bring better products to market faster. Su emphasized, “We’re investing today for the return in a couple of years, and I think that’s absolutely the right thing to do. That’s the way to think about these investment cycles.” AMD’s strategic focus on AI and its strong financial performance underscore its robust position in the rapidly evolving technology landscape, highlighting the company’s potential for sustained growth in the coming years.",0.5537,NEGATIVE,0.8673

"AMD Q3 Preview EPS Jumps 30% YoY, Close Gap with Nvidia.csv","AMD will release its Q3 earnings report on October 29th, after the U.S. markets close. Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year. This report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure. With Nvidia's earnings report on the horizon, AMD's results offer a useful benchmark. Although AMD has significantly underperformed Nvidia year-to-date, this could be an opportunity to turn the tables. Data Center Growth is Key Analysts predict AMD's data center revenue will reach a record $3.52 billion for Q3. In July, CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in strong revenue growth for the year's second half, driven by demand for Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. Earlier this month, AMD launched its latest data center AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, and investors are keen to see its performance. Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari pointed to sustained growth in AI infrastructure capital expenditure, a recovery in server CPUs, and AMD's ongoing market share gains. AMD's x86 server CPU market share rose to 34% by Q2 2024 from less than 20% in early 2022, and Goldman Sachs expects AMD's next-generation server CPUs could further extend its edge over Intel Corp.",0.6043,POSITIVE,0.9866

"Apple reportedly seeks to lock out its competitors from TSMC's 2nm process, by booking all of its ma.csv","Apple has long been cozy with TSMC, the manufacturer of the chips that end up in ever-popular iPhone, iPad and Mac products. When you've got as much cash on hand as Apple does, it puts it in a favorable position to negotiate deals with the Taiwan-based chipmaker. Now it is reportedly seeking to lock in 100% of TSMC's bleeding edge 2nm production capacity, giving it a competitive advantage when products eventually make their way to the market. According to 9to5mac (via Extreme tech), Apple's chief operating officer met with TSMC bosses to negotiate terms to secure 2nm capacity. The report cites 'local sources', so there needs to be a pinch of salt here, but given Apple's track record of locking up TSMC's capacity, this would certainly come as no surprise. TSMC's 2nm process is currently scheduled to enter risk production in 2025, with volume production set for the second half of 2025. That means the upcoming iPhone 16 family with A18 chips will stick with 3nm, but it could mean the high end iPhone 17 Pro and Max could be the first in line to be built with 2nm technology. The specifics of deals between TSMC and its customers are obviously not made public, but it is widely accepted that Apple booked all of TSMC's 3nm capacity, at least for a period of time. These chips, including the A17 and M3 families made their way into the latest generation iPhone 15 Pros and MacBooks. That would make Apple's 2nm play unsurprising. It's easy to see why Apple would attempt to secure the maximum amount of 2nm capacity. It will give it an advantage over its competitors, as 2nm chips will allow Apple to pack in more transistors into a given area, leading to better performance or lower power consumption—if not both. Samsung has its own manufacturing capacity, and future Exynos chips will be built in-house, but 2nm Snapdragon and possibly Google Tensor chips may have to wait in line behind Apple. Even mega-companies such as Google and Qualcomm don't have the cash on hand to outbid big daddy Apple. It's not just Arm competitors that will be disadvantaged. Nvidia will want every possible power and performance advantage it can get as it dominates the market for AI processors, while AMD will also have to wait for access to the best nodes. Even Intel could find itself at a disadvantage given some of the tiles for its chips are manufactured by TSMC.

Bloomberg Again Reports on Semiconductors With Flimsy Information on Secret Government Contacts.csv,"Usually, when things that are leaked with an intention the entity where the leak comes from is pleased with said leak. Not for Bloomberg though. Bloomberg actually accomplishes citing an anonymous source about on ongoing discussions related to chip distribution and subsequently takes that information to the White House National Security Council to ask them to comment. Here is the WHNSC's response. Bloomberg: US Weighs Capping Exports of AI Chips From Nvidia and AMD to Some Countries A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the talks but pointed to a recent joint statement by the US and UAE on artificial intelligence. In it, the two countries acknowledged the “tremendous potential of AI for good,” as well as the “challenges and risks of this emerging technology and the vital importance of safeguards.” The council responds with a no comment while directing them to a positive statement. To me, this greatly diminishes whomever the Bloomberg contact is. This is the second time that Bloomberg goes out of their way citing a leaky government source that on it's own merits isn't really that sensational at all. The headline is sensational the reality is not. The approach would set a ceiling on export licenses for certain countries in the interest of national security, according to the people, who described the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Officials are focused on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing appetite for AI data centers and the deep pockets to fund them, the people said. This isn't even news. Reuters reported on this a month ago with a much more neutral to positive tone. Which it is. Reuters: US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia to data centers in the Middle East.Since October 2023, U.S. exporters have been required to obtain licenses before shipping advanced chips to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.Under the new rule, data centers will be able to apply for Validated End User status that will allow them to receive chips under a general authorization, rather than requiring their U.S. suppliers to obtain individual licenses to ship to them. If you're tracking, this simply seems to be the 2nd half of that original conversation. There are already chip restrictions. Nvidia is already not delivering the most advanced chips to those countries. The framework proposed would allow Nvidia to deliver chips under certain restrictions and guidelines. Bloomberg acknowledges this towards the tail end of the article. While officials have debated the best approach, they’ve slowed high-volume AI chip license approvals to the Middle East and elsewhere. But there are signs things could get moving soon: Under the new rules for shipments to data centers, US officials will vet and preapprove specific customers based on security commitments from both the companies and their national governments, paving the way for easier licensing down the road. What I don't understand is why does Bloomberg like to make things salacious when they're seemingly not. There is 0 chips to parts of the Middle-East today, but the U.S. government is working on a framework that may relieve that. Reuter story from a month ago. The end.

Could PLTR go on a TSLA-like Run (70%) if Included in SP500.csv,"On June 7th, S&P 500 is set to rebalance and Palantir will be eligible for the third time. With the spotlight on AI and Palantir's continued strong performance, there's a very high likelihood it is included in the S&P, which could lead PLTR going on a Tesla-like run. First, let me break down why Palantir is a great candidate for inclusion. Inclusion in the S&P 500 index involves meeting several stringent criteria related to market capitalization, liquidity, financial viability, and corporate governance. For Palantir Technologies (PLTR) to be considered a good candidate for S&P 500 inclusion, it must satisfy these key requirements: Market Capitalization: A company must have a market cap of at least $14.6 billion (as of 2023). Palantir's market capitalization has been above this threshold for a while. Liquidity: Companies need to have adequate liquidity, with a high trading volume. Palantir's shares are actively traded, reflecting strong investor interest and sufficient liquidity. Financial Viability: The company must report positive earnings in the most recent quarter and over the last four quarters combined. Palantir has demonstrated profitability, reporting positive GAAP EPS in recent quarters (InvestorPlace). U.S. Based: Companies must be U.S.-based, with the majority of their assets and revenues derived from the U.S. Palantir fits this criterion, being headquartered in Denver, Colorado, and deriving significant revenue from U.S. operations. Public Float: At least 50% of a company's shares must be in the public float. Palantir's public float percentage is adequate to meet this requirement, with substantial institutional ownership indicating wide distribution among public shareholders Palantir meets all the eligibility criteria, the only which could be a problem is corporate governance, ie, the insiders own a lot of shares of the company; however there are tons of examples of other companies that have a similar structure. As many of you know, Tesla went on a 70% in the weeks leading up to and the month following its inclusion. However, it's not alone. Many other ""sexy/high-profile"" names go on epic runs when SP500 inclusion is announced. Twitter (TWTR) Inclusion Date: June 7, 2018 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $26 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on May 21, 2018, Twitter's stock increased by approximately 14%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, Twitter's stock increased by about 5%. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2019 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2019, NXP's stock rose by approximately 10%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, NXP's stock increased by around 6%. AMD (Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.) (AMD) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2017 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $20 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2017, AMD's stock increased by approximately 12%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, AMD's stock rose by around 9%. T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS) Inclusion Date: June 22, 2020 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on June 5, 2020, T-Mobile's stock increased by approximately 8%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, T-Mobile's stock saw an increase of about 7%. NVIDIA (NVDA) Inclusion Date: November 18, 2001 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $25 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: NVIDIA's stock saw a significant rise, roughly around 20-25%, in the weeks leading up to the inclusion. Month Following Inclusion: The stock continued to perform well, with an additional increase of around 10-15%. ""S&P 500 effect,"" is a real phenomenon and I think it's even more powerful with high-profile names like Palantir. As mentioned earlier, Tesla went on a god-like run in the weeks leading up to and after the announcement. And I think Palantir shares many characteristics with Tesla that may see it go on a similar run. Both companies have a very high-profile CEO. Alex Karp is loved by Palantir holders just like Elon is by Tesla fanboys, which leads to my most important point: retail ownership. Palantir has a significant amount of its shares outstanding owned by retail; if SP500 inclusion is announced and institutions have to buy shares it may create a similar move like Tesla's as most palantir fanboys won't sell. Like Tesla, they believe Palantir is changing the world (look at their subreddit). I think buying Palantir options is a great upside play with limited downside, depending on when you purchase your options. The inclusion announcement is on Friday after hours, so you could buy Friday before close or anytime this week and sell Monday morning if its not included for a minimum loss. And with options being so cheap, this could be a 50-bagger if it goes to 30 bucks. 6/21 23 C 6/21 25 C.",0.5557,POSITIVE,0.7174

How Terrifying is the Start of August.csv,"Just over the past three trading days, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 indices have all recorded their largest three-day cumulative decline since June 2022! Last night, the Nasdaq plummeted by over 6% at one point, and the S&P 500 dropped by more than 4%, with both indices returning to their early May levels by the close of trading. Although the major U.S. indices and individual stocks still closed with significant losses, the intraday declines were somewhat moderated. The primary reason for this was the release of the U.S. July ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, which rebounded from a four-year low in June to 51.4, exceeding market expectations and returning to the expansion zone above 50! Sub-indices, including the New Orders Index and Employment Index, also showed growth. Notably, the Employment Index reached 51.1, marking the largest increase since September of last year and the first time this year that it has entered the expansion zone above 50. This data slightly alleviated fears from last week's significant non-farm payroll decline, making the market believe that the drop in new jobs was primarily due to Hurricane Barry hitting Texas. 👉 As discussed previously, the sharp decline in U.S. stocks at the start of August stemmed from worries about the U.S. economy falling into recession. Therefore, when the ISM Non-Manufacturing number showed growth yesterday, it somewhat restored market confidence in the economy, helping to narrow the intraday losses of U.S. stocks. The U.S. stock market now needs to see positive economic growth news to recover, unlike before when everyone was hoping for bad news, anticipating a Federal Reserve interest rate cut! Hence, it is crucial to continue monitoring other economic data. If strong and robust growth numbers do not consistently appear, investors will remain concerned about an economic recession, and the trend of selling stocks for cash will not end. The VIX Fear Index is a crucial indicator to observe market sentiment calming down. It surged above 55 in early trading, a level not seen since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020!",0.5444,NEGATIVE,0.9913

Also I looked at where it dropped when EY announced they wouldn't proceed as their auditors amd $34.5 is about the level they closed at that day. Finally, $34.5 is within my personal risk tolerance. guh Today, I’m minding my own business, scrolling Reddit, eating a sandwich, watching Ana De Armas AI Porn, minding my own business.

I wait all year for this opportunity - now I'm going to share it with you.csv,"If you trade long enough, you begin to see patterns emerge. On October 30th, one of my favorite patterns is starting. If you buy AMD stock on the last Monday of October, the average return for the rest of the year is 24.52%, and the stock is higher 88.89% of the time. This data starts in 2015 because it is the first full year after Dr. Lisa Su became CEO of AMD. Some of you may be wondering why this period is so strong for AMD stock. Let me share my personal theory. AMD depends on TSMC for chip manufacturing. Taiwan is protected by its geography and weather, but the Chinese have two windows of opportunity to cross the Strait with favorable weather. The first is from late March to the end of April. The second is from late September to late October. Last year, China launched major military exercises around Taiwan in April. This year, they did it in October, which just ended a few days ago. (They also launch these exercises when they are provoked, such as when Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan or during the recent Taiwanese elections.) In my view, the end of October triggers a relief rally in stocks related to TSMC, most notably AMD and Nvidia. This combines with earnings and strong seasonality, resulting in massive outperformance in a relatively short period of time. A quick word of warning—this time period includes earnings. If you want to avoid earnings risk, you can wait until the first Monday of November. If you wait until November, the average return is 19.06%, and the stock is higher 77.78% of the time by the end of the year. Here is a quick comparison I do all this shit manually so I apologize if there is an error in one of my calculations. My positions: Long 1000 shares with a cost basis of $157.90. Although I am considering switching to a risk reversal. I would use a risk reversal selling the Jan. 2025 $155 puts collecting 12.70 then using that to buy twice as many Jan. 2025 $180 calls for $6.50 (I would buy x2 as many calls to make the net cost ~.30)",0.5754,NEGATIVE,0.8872

Intel was seen as a bargain in 2023 compared to NVDA and AMD after their 400% run up. US gov have vested interest in Intel. No they are not propping Intel up, but it's effectively giving Intel a big loan to buy a second house. That loan can pay off if the housing market goes up, or they are double fucked because they leveraged to buy a second house. If you bought Intel because china will invade Taiwan, you are really regarded. If China invades Taiwan, everything is going to sell. That's a disruption of global trade on WW2 levels. Your best case scenario still loses you money. Intel bullish scenario is 18A, High-Na EUV paying dividends, early experience granting them a year technological lead over TSMC. It doesn't have to work, but the upside is a 10x from these levels. TSMC pass up High NA EUV is repeating the same decision Intel did in 2012 when Intel controlled the market and did not view EUV as economically feasible. Again, doesn't mean TSMC is incorrect in their assessment, but history does repeat itself. Intel bearish scenario is just repeat of 2016 and delay after delay.

INTC and AMD.csv,"Thesis: AMD ($AMD) and Intel ($INTC) are Undervalued Stocks In the dynamic and highly competitive semiconductor industry, AMD ($AMD) and Intel ($INTC) have demonstrated remarkable resilience, innovation, and market presence. Despite their solid fundamentals, both companies appear undervalued when considering their current market prices relative to their intrinsic value, future growth potential, and industry positioning. This thesis will explore the reasons behind this undervaluation, focusing on financial performance, strategic initiatives, market trends, and competitive advantages. Financial Performance and Valuation Metrics Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratios: Both AMD and Intel have P/E ratios that are below the industry average, suggesting that the market has not fully recognized their earnings potential. AMD's forward P/E ratio is around 25, while Intel's is approximately 12, compared to the semiconductor industry average of 30-35. Revenue and Earnings Growth: AMD has exhibited robust revenue growth, driven by its strong product portfolio and increasing market share in both consumer and data center segments. The company's revenue grew by over 20% year-over-year in the last few quarters. Intel, despite facing competitive pressures, has maintained stable revenue streams, with significant contributions from its data center and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Cash Flow and Profitability: Both companies generate substantial cash flows, supporting their ability to invest in R&D and return value to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. AMD's free cash flow margin stands at around 10%, while Intel's is approximately 20%. Strategic Initiatives and Technological Advancements Product Innovation: AMD's Ryzen and EPYC processors have gained significant traction, challenging Intel's dominance in the CPU market. The company's advancements in 7nm and 5nm process technologies have positioned it as a formidable competitor in both consumer and enterprise markets. Intel has made strides in expanding its product lineup, with significant investments in AI, machine learning, and autonomous driving technologies. The introduction of its Alder Lake processors and advancements in 10nm and future 7nm nodes signal a robust product roadmap. Strategic Acquisitions: AMD's acquisition of Xilinx is expected to enhance its capabilities in adaptive computing and bolster its presence in key growth markets such as 5G, automotive, and aerospace. Intel's acquisition of Mobileye and investments in autonomous vehicle technology underscore its commitment to diversifying its revenue streams and capitalizing on emerging tech trends. Market Trends and Competitive Landscape Demand for Semiconductors: The global semiconductor market is projected to grow significantly, driven by increasing demand for high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, and IoT applications. Both AMD and Intel are well-positioned to capitalize on these trends. Competitive Positioning: AMD's competitive pricing and performance advantages have enabled it to gain market share from Intel, particularly in the desktop and server CPU markets. Intel's extensive ecosystem and strong brand equity continue to make it a preferred choice for many enterprise customers. Underappreciated Catalysts Supply Chain Resilience: Both companies have demonstrated resilience in navigating the global semiconductor supply chain challenges. AMD's partnerships with TSMC and Intel's plans to build new fabs in the US and Europe are strategic moves to mitigate supply risks and ensure capacity for future growth. Expansion into New Markets: AMD's foray into gaming consoles with partnerships with Sony and Microsoft, as well as Intel's advancements in the data center, networking, and edge computing, present substantial growth opportunities that are not fully reflected in their current valuations. Conclusion In conclusion, AMD and Intel are undervalued stocks, with market prices that do not fully reflect their intrinsic value, robust financial performance, strategic initiatives, and potential for growth in the rapidly evolving semiconductor industry. Investors should consider the compelling investment case for both companies, driven by their innovation, competitive positioning, and resilience in the face of industry challenges. As the global demand for semiconductors continues to rise, AMD and Intel are well-equipped to deliver sustained value, making them attractive opportunities for long-term investment.",0.5699,POSITIVE,0.9975

Intel - Pinnacle of failure.csv,"Intel's Slippery Slope: Financial Woes, Investor Distrust, and Leadership Issues Intel Corporation, once a dominant force in the tech industry, is now grappling with a series of significant challenges that have fueled a troubling decline. Despite attempts to project a positive outlook, the company’s current trajectory suggests a troubling downward spiral. Financial Performance and Market Challenges Intel's financial performance has continued to deteriorate. For the first half of 2024, Intel reported revenues of $24 billion, marking a slight decrease compared to previous periods. This decline is occurring amid a broader tech sector recovery and highlights Intel’s struggle to maintain its competitive edge. The company's net income for this period was a mere $800 million, translating to a profit margin of approximately 3.3%, indicating substantial operational inefficiencies and intense competition from rivals such as AMD and NVIDIA. Declining Customer Satisfaction and Product Concerns Customer dissatisfaction remains a critical issue. The release of Intel's 14th Gen Core processors has not addressed the performance inconsistencies that plagued previous models. While the company has introduced new features, reviews suggest that these updates have not significantly improved reliability or performance compared to competitors. This ongoing issue is eroding customer trust and impacting market share. Eroding Investor Confidence Investor confidence in Intel is faltering. The recent involvement of Apollo Global Management has raised concerns, particularly following Apollo’s controversial investment decisions in other sectors. Additionally, a recent lawsuit filed by major institutional investors alleges mismanagement and failure to deliver on key performance promises. This legal battle has further shaken confidence, prompting several large investors to divest from Intel, exacerbating the company's financial strain. Leadership and Legal Troubles Intel's leadership is facing intense scrutiny. Recent high-profile exits, including the departure of several senior executives, have led to a perception of instability at the top. The company's reliance on legal strategies to address its challenges, rather than focusing on operational and strategic improvements, appears to be aggravatinh its difficulties. This reactive approach is not addressing the underlying issues affecting Intel’s performance. Future Prospects and Potential Downturn Intel’s future prospects remain uncertain. Despite a significant $15 billion R&D budget, the company’s progress in key areas like AI and autonomous driving lags behind that of its more agile competitors. Moreover, while short-term production issues in Taiwan have provided some temporary relief, these are unlikely to reverse the long-term downward trend. The competitive landscape continues to evolve rapidly, and Intel’s slower adaptation could hinder its recovery prospects. TL;DR Intel’s current strategy, which includes overhauling its product lineup and executive team, appears to be a desperate attempt to stabilize its position. For investors and stakeholders, the warning signs are clear: Intel’s challenges are substantial, and the company’s efforts to turn things around may not be sufficient in the face of ongoing and evolving issues. If you are considering investing in Intel, it might be intelligent to reassess your position given the company's precarious situation. Just my two cents.",0.5404,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Intel DD.csv,"🚀INTC – Here's the DD You Need🚀 🚀 Summary Intel (INTC) is poised to skyrocket to $70-100 per share once they establish themselves as the go-to foundry. TSMC is slipping up and lagging in high-NA EUV. In 2-3 years, Intel's foundry business will be dominating. 🚀 The Catalyst: Intel's Foundry Push TSMC's Slip-Up: TSMC is behind on high-NA EUV tech, opening a huge window for Intel. Intel's Timeline: Expect Intel to capitalize on this in the next 2-3 years, becoming the top choice for chip manufacturing. 🚀 One API and Gaudi 3: The CUDA Killer One API Rollout: Intel’s One API, supported by big names like GOOG, Arm, Qcomm, and Samsung, is set to dethrone NVDA’s CUDA. Gaudi 3 vs H100: Intel’s Gaudi 3 will outperform NVDA's H100, making Intel the new favorite for AI acceleration and datacenters. CUDA’s Weakness: NVDA's market share is heavily reliant on CUDA. Once One API is fully rolled out, NVDA's grip on the market will loosen. 🚀 Competitive Advantage: Software Over Hardware The Software Edge: While anyone can build a good GPU, the real money is in the software ecosystem. Intel’s One API will give them a massive edge over AMD and NVDA. Market Perception: A lot of people underestimate Intel stock. They don't realize the potential they're holding. 🚀 Conclusion Intel is massively undervalued right now. With the impending dominance of their foundry business and the rollout of One API, INTC is set to soar. Don't miss out on this rocket ship to $70-100 per share. Get in now and thank me later.

Intel is a good buy.csv,"We are all well aware Intel is having it's own Boeing moment right now with design flaws in their CPUs and horrible customer service. They deserve the steaming pile dooky that is currently sitting atop their share value. That being said, they have an ace that may flip the entire market on it's head: They own their fabs. That's right: all the other big boys in town design and give their blueprints for TSMC to manufacture. That's true of AMD, Nvidia, and other ARM and mobile chip designers. Intel is the only large scale chip designers that is more or less vertically integrated. As you may know, they just got $8.8B from papa Biden to build more foundries in Ohio and Arizona, in addition to their other sites across the world. None of this is particularly noteworthy until you consider that China has always been very interested in Chinesing Taiwan, and are even more so now that they have been embargoed from Nvidia chips by the US. The Chinese military build-up over the past decade has focused heavily on amphibious warfare, and long range anti-naval weapons (think carrier buster ballistic/boost-glide stand off weapons.) It doesn't take a Ph.D in geopolitics to understand what the move is here. On the US/allied side, the discourse around Taiwan has slowly shifted: what started out as ""we have overwhelming force and we will stop any attempt at an invasion of Taiwan"" has become something like ""Maybe we can't stop them from invading, but we can make it a Pyrrhic victory"". This may actually be the case, but the trend is not great. You will have noticed Taiwan has been increasingly politically isolated, mirroring the growing Chinese military power in the region. So what happens to TSMC if Taiwan gets Chinesed? As you can imagine, China is interested in acquiring as many TSMC assets and personnel intact as possible. This means you can bet your degenerate bacon that US intelligence services have contingencies to extradite key scientists and engineers, and scuttle the production plants and machines before the Chinese can take control of them. But the result is easy to predict: no more TSMC. This means the personnel extradited will be used to advise and run US production plants owned by, you guessed it: Intel. Intel will have a quasi monopoly on chip manufacturing. The US government see this of course, that's why they are strongly nudging Nvidia to play nice with Intel, because they see a potential future where Intel is the only player in town capable of making Nvidia chips, or any consumer chips at all for that matter, in the West.

Intel is a pretty safe bet and are undervalued.csv,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs. An additional benefit is that Intel can leverage their fabs in order to achieve higher margins for their own products. It's possible Intel's stock could be hit again in a month or so when their report comes out, but they are likely already at bottom.",0.5493,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Is INTC undervalued .csv,"Valuation Analysis of Intel Corporation Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has long been a key player in the semiconductor industry, but recent market developments and the rise of competitors like AMD and Nvidia have caused its stock to significantly underperform relative to its peers. As of Q2 2024, Intel’s total assets amount to approximately $182 billion, with liabilities around $91 billion, resulting in a net asset value of $91 billion. Yet, its market capitalization is around $95 billion, reflecting an almost 1:1 ratio between market cap and net assets. In contrast, competitors such as AMD and Nvidia trade at significantly higher premiums, indicating that the market may be underpricing Intel’s growth potential. Company Market Cap (Billion $) Net Assets (Billion $) Price to Net Asset Ratio Intel 95 91 1.04 AMD 266 56.5 4.71 Nvidia 3,000 58.15 51.58 Understanding Intel’s Valuation The Price to Net Asset Ratio (P/NAV) is a critical measure of how the market values a company relative to its net assets. Intel's current P/NAV of 1.04 reveals that its market value is nearly identical to its net assets, a valuation that appears surprisingly low, particularly when compared to its competitors. AMD and Nvidia, for instance, demonstrate P/NAV ratios of 4.71 and 51.58, respectively. This significant gap highlights the possibility that Intel is undervalued, especially given its strong fundamentals and growth potential. Several factors support this assessment. Despite facing fierce competition, Intel remains a leader in the semiconductor industry, known for its quality and innovation. The company is making substantial investments in new technologies and manufacturing capabilities, positioning itself to capitalize on growing trends such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, Intel boasts a robust balance sheet, with total assets of about $182 billion and liabilities around $91 billion. This financial strength provides a solid foundation for future growth and strategic initiatives. Although the recent decision to lay off 15,000 employees might seem concerning, it is part of a broader strategy to enhance operational efficiency and focus on core competencies, enabling Intel to adapt more effectively to evolving market demands. A key factor influencing Intel's future is the increasing global demand for semiconductors. As technology becomes more integrated into daily life, the need for high-performance chips continues to rise. Intel's resources and commitment to innovation position it to capture a larger share of this expanding market. Moreover, government support for the semiconductor industry adds another layer of potential upside for Intel. Given the strategic importance of semiconductor manufacturing in light of global supply chain challenges, particularly concerning the Taiwan-China situation, there is growing interest from government entities to bolster domestic semiconductor production. This focus on strengthening local supply chains can create favorable conditions for Intel, as it could receive both financial incentives and regulatory support to expand its operations and enhance its competitive positioning. Conclusion In summary, Intel Corporation is significantly undervalued based on its current P/NAV ratio. The company possesses strong assets, a history of innovation, and a strategic focus on future technologies. As Intel continues to execute its strategic plans and navigate market challenges, it has substantial potential to regain its competitive edge and achieve remarkable growth. Furthermore, the increasing government interest in supporting semiconductor manufacturing amid geopolitical uncertainties enhances Intel's prospects. The market's current valuation does not adequately reflect Intel's true value and growth potential, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

Long-time AMD Holder (Cost Basis 1904) Starting to Sell - Anyone Else Disappointed in the Stock in 2.csv,"Wrote about my thinking below... Out of the 31 large banks, 25 have a “buy” rating and 6 have a “hold” rating on AMD 0.29%↑. It’s hard to think about why to sell when everyone is telling you to buy, but I am of the opinion that is when it should be most deeply considered. image credit to tipranks.com AMD has been my most profitable investment of the past 5 years, having risen 800% since purchased in August of 2018. For most investors (including myself), it’s difficult to part with winners. Not only that, I am someone who believes AI will proliferate throughout society in the coming years. Because they design data center GPUs, AMD should be one of the primary beneficiaries as the AI boom continues. It might seem counter-intuitive then to sell the stock here, but that is what I’ve begun doing over the past two weeks. I had high hopes for AMD this year, but it’s my view that they've failed to take significant data center GPU market share from Nvidia, and will have increased competition from Intel's new product offerings (on both client and data center), as well as proprietary silicon from large cloud players (Google, Amazon, etc). My original thesis was that AMD would profit from overextended Nvidia margins in 2024, but this underestimated the CUDA ecosystem moat that existed with Nvidia data center products (see Why I Got Nvidia Wrong). While most large cloud players want to diversify at least somewhat from Nvidia, they are still unable to do so without risking a competitive advantage with their own AI offerings. Add Intel into the mix, and the margin and market share pressure will be on AMD. The only player in the silicon value chain I think which can currently raise margins is TSMC (TSM 2.61%↑), but the geopolitical risk is too high for me to continue holding the stock (I sold my TSMC stake two weeks ago). On the PC (personal computer), Nvidia has always had a strong moat. It’s not just because they have the best performing products, but also because game developers are economically incentivized to optimize first (and often only) for the largest potential audience. This is similar to the moat CUDA protects on the data center side. One might think that Nvidia charging incredibly high prices for discrete graphics cards would cause them to lose share to AMD with consumers who directly purchase the products (as opposed to businesses who purchase the data center products). Yet Nvidia market share has only grown over the past few years. Data from Jon Peddie Research Why This Take Could Be Wrong: There is a lot of bullish momentum in the investor community around AMD currently from both professional commentators and retail investors (e.g. Twitter / X). Many people who had never heard of AMD 5 years ago are now saying to put money into the stock as it is Nvidia’s only pure AI competitor. As a result of this, AMD could see a dramatic rise on a positive earnings report later this month. In addition, I expect gaming revenues to surprise to the upside with the minor refresh of Xbox and Playstation consoles coming for holiday season. I still have ~260 shares of AMD remaining, and will likely hold to see if the stock jumps on the report. I think that AMD is extremely stretched in its current valuation (P/E of 205), and that any bad news could send it spiralling. Selling half of the remaining stake now is essentially a hedge against this possibility. Whatever happens with the earnings report, I will likely reduce my AMD holdings to zero in the next few months as I continue to lower exposure to companies reliant on Taiwan.",0.5591,NEGATIVE,0.9976

This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn’t translated into higher overall sales just yet. Internationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk. Defying the Odds Announcing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away. Despite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a ""buy"" and none recommending a sell. Looking Forward The golden arches are taking a ""forensic approach"" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales. So, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future. On The Horizon Tomorrow Economic Data and Earnings This week is buzzing with key economic data, especially on the employment front. Tomorrow, we'll get the June JOLTS report, which stands for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. This report measures job openings, hirings, and separations (like firings and retirements), offering a detailed snapshot of the U.S. job market. The May report surprised everyone with an unexpected increase in job openings, suggesting a stronger labor market. This might just be the signal the Fed needs to consider rate cuts sooner than expected. Earnings season is heating up, and the first of the Magnificent Seven stocks reports tomorrow after the close. Before Market Open Corning ($GLW) has unexpectedly become an AI favorite this year. Investors believe the glass and screen maker will benefit from the tech upgrade cycle. However, Corning’s traditionally steady growth might not match these high expectations. If management doesn’t deliver impressive forecasts, a selloff could be on the horizon. Analysts are expecting $0.46 EPS and $3.54 billion in revenue. Paypal ($PYPL) faced a setback when Apple introduced a competing payment service in June. Nonetheless, PayPal remains robust, thanks to its strong e-commerce presence, Venmo's popularity, and its new checkout system, Fastlane. Optimistic shareholders are hoping for an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are $0.89 EPS and $7.14 billion in revenue. After Market Close Microsoft ($MSFT) kicks off the Magnificent Seven earnings. Investors are eager to hear updates on its AI investments, Azure cloud computing business, and future plans. Wall Street is optimistic, with all analysts rating it a ""buy."" Expected figures are $2.93 EPS and $64.36 billion in revenue. Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), a key player in the semiconductor space, will reveal its full-year sales forecast, setting the tone for the industry. Confidence is high, with 30 out of 36 analysts rating it a ""buy"" and a price target 40% above current levels. Expected numbers are $0.68 EPS and $5.72 billion in revenue.",0.5415,NEGATIVE,0.9996

Microsoft’s Cloud Rain on Earnings Parade In a classic case of “so close, yet so far,” Microsoft ($MSFT) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, only to see its stock plummet over 5.79% in after-hours trading. Why? Investors fixated on the company’s disappointing Azure cloud revenue. Earnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints Microsoft’s revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure’s performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue—just shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub’s impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn’t enough to quell investor concerns. By the Numbers Revenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected Market Reaction and Future Outlook While the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft’s other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure’s growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn’t enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft’s shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500’s 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market’s laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters. Chips Ahoy! AMD’s Data Center Sales Surge 115% AMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let’s break it down. Earnings Breakdown AMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street’s expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter AI Chips and Data Center Dominance The tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company’s overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast. Other Segments and Market Reaction While the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD’s business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year AMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high. On The Horizon Tomorrow’s labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let’s be honest, they’re all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week’s job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes. Before Market Open Boeing ($BA): Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels. Expected: $3.51 EPS, $6.85 billion in revenue. Marriott International ($MAR) : The hospitality giant thrived post-pandemic with revenge spending, but the travel boom is slowing. Investors are eager to hear how Marriott plans to attract more budget-conscious travelers. Expected: $2.47 EPS, $6.48 billion in revenue. After Market Close Meta Platforms ($META): Next up in the Mag 7 parade, Meta’s spending spree on AI, including the new Llama 3.1 model, is under the microscope. The focus will be on how these investments impact cash flow and margins. Expected: $4.72 EPS, $38.30 billion in revenue. Arm Holdings ($ARM): With a staggering 94% rise in 2024, Arm’s valuation is in question. Shareholders are keen to see continued strong demand for semiconductors without sacrificing margins. Expected: $0.34 EPS, $903.57 million in revenue.",0.5605,NEGATIVE,0.9997

Now my question : was the stock overpriced (experienced a +70% share price within 6 months) and is now corrected to its accurate value during the off-market.

My Analysis on ARM Holdings 2 Trillion+ Valuation.csv,"I believe ARM Holdings is slept on! I believe it could be the next NVIDIA. As of this writing its Market Cap is sitting at $142.36 Billion. I believe that its market cap should be ATLEAST 1 trillion due to the fact that it has an enormous market share of damn near if not more of 95% of the worlds smart device chips. What makes ARM unique is its business model. Their primary source of revenue is from the leasing of the design of the instruction set of computer chips. For those who dont know the instruction set is often referred to as an instruction set architecture (ISA), is a group of commands for a CPU in machine language. These commands tell the processor what operations to perform. Each instruction in the set specifies a particular operation to be performed on a specified set of data operands. The instruction set is fundamental to the design and functionality of computer chips, dictating how software communicates with hardware... So what is unique about this? Well I will tell you, these instruction sets are incredibly energy effecient compared to what is used currently for AI such as RISC or X86 etc. Currently NVIDIA is soaring because of the AI craze and its success has put light onto AMD, INTEL, SMCI etc but I believe ARM is a sleeper in my opinion. Their main source on revenue is through the royalties it recieves for leasing its designs. They can easily raise the royalty rate to increase their revenue stream anytime but there are some downsides. There customers could leave them and use other options. I dont think that is going to happen because lets face it their intellectual property is far better than any of the competition in terms of effeciency. AI is growing rapidly and one key expense is going to be energy consumption. Especially in these data centers. To my knowledge most data centers run on chips that use x86 from Intel. Those chips using that instruction set uses alot of energy. I believe data centers are looking to convert to a more energy effecient chip and when they do.... ENTER: ARM. Arm is currently used in almost all smart devices because again they are energy effecient. Why do we have longer battery life in a smart phones? Its because of ARM. What chips do electric cars use? ARM what instruction set does your microwave, fridge, washing machine use? ARM. Currently ARM is all over the portable device market but once they hit the data centers I believe there revenue is going to explode and therefore the market cap. There are major catalysts going down right now such as Microsoft partnering with them to make ARM based laptops and NVIDIA collaborating with them to make computers, not to mention that Tesla ordered a ton of NVIDIA chips that use ARM architecture. But my most bullish thing about ARM is what Jensen Huang said at Computex. He said that AI will eventually become physical in terms of robotics. Do you think those robotics need a energy sucker of a computerchip instruction set? No, the need the most energy effecient tech in todays age and that where ARM steps up right again. Currently we only use AI remotely (Chat GPT, Picture Generators, Etc.) but once we put AI into something physical and tangible such as robots to do everyday tasks those devices and robots need to run on the most advance and effecient software. I am currently looking at an outlook of 5-15 years and I am long on my position is this stock. We all seen what nvidia did and can only imagine what the next stock can yield the same returns and I think its ARM Holdings. Imagine going back to 2017 and investing into NVIDIA when the markect cap was the same as ARM now. Those returns look nice right if you have invested then. The time is now. Please keep in mind that i have not decided to go completely in depth of all of my research on ARM Holdings so please do your own. Also, I purposefully did not go into fundementals such as earnings and revenue on this. This is just my personal long term outlook on the research I have done. There are plenty more catalysts and risks out there so please DYOR. Feel free to comment!",0.5404,POSITIVE,0.9991
My best year ever.csv,"I sold a bunch of positions into cash lately to protect my gains. And wanted to take a step back and appreciate the growth this year My biggest trades that moved the needle: Owning GBTC, CLSK, and ETHE since mid 2023.

Bought March monthly SMCI calls on Feb 27, sold March 4 after SMCI popped 20% when it was announced over the weekend that it was being added to S&P500. That put position went from $1.3k to $16k. This also marked the local top you see back in March. Proceeded to degen more on AI and got chopped up, leading to 5 month consolidation valley you see shorted $62k worth of NVDA, AMD, and QQQ Aug 1, then Japan announced some scary nothing burger and I made $45k profit.

My outlook on markets going forward - from a dear regard.csv,"January 2024: market starts to price in anticipated 4-5 rate cuts in 2024. Tech moons. Small/Mid caps stagnant. for the first quarter you could make bank - i made 30k through march and withdrew that shit to pay for my kids school. April 2024: I am now a reformed bear continuing bull strategy from the first 6 weeks: S*P drop 5.4% through April 19 - higher than expected inflation date. Push rates higher, lower # of anticipated rate cuts. I got hammered trying the same call strategy. Gave away 15k if not more. May 2024: AI AI AI every time you say AI in your earnings call the price goes up $1. S&P up 5.96% June 2024: News Report: tech doesn't even need a rate cut to continue the bull run. June 12 $AAPL says ""APPLE INTELLIGENCE"", reaches all time highs. (puts for their earnings btw). $NVDA 140% for the year? After last year we were like WTF how is this 300 a share let alone 1400 a share in June. July 2024 $GOOG $AMZN up ~80-100% for the year. Look, its logical to take profits. No shame in that especially for retail who loses out 90% of the time. July 2024: Rate cuts like 99.999% almost certain for sept. Now suddenly Small/Mid caps rally in a massive sector rotation. $SPX/$NDX tanks. Next week: 1T outflows. Then they pump and dump the russel up 12% to 2022 highs and then sell off for a quick 6% while everyones FOMOing into $RUT. Maybe more like RUT RO!!!! I Fomo'd last of dry powder MOnday but after earnings I'm turning bearish. Tomorrow 5k realized loss for me or hold to 0. Too hard to beat the street. Profit taking, buying million dollar real estate with cash like smart investors do. Sit on the sidelines and let it bleed. But here we are still FOMO'ing calls and short dated puts that would only print 1/1000 times. Over the past few days 3 mag 7 earnings all tanked and here we are. AMD? CPUs Good for gamers and graphics cards for poors. Pennies compared to $NVDA. $NVDA has a monopoly on AI software like $ASML has a monopoly on lithography and $TSM has a monopoly on chip production. $TSLA obviously seemingly doomed. Google can't take your cookies anymore, advertising revenue down MoM. Wanna get cucked by the zuck? I'm tempted to donate $1 to people wanting to buy $META calls at this point. TLDR: This looks like the same pattern we have had in 2022 and 2023 when markets take a downturn through mid-late October. Look at the previous years. I posted last week about the last 4 septembers being red. It looks like we are in another downturn. Earnings indicates it. I don't think CPI and PCE will save us this week. I'm scrounging up 25k waiting for the correction / dip / crash and buying SHARES so i never waste so much of my lifetime just to lose money speculating with options. Will post my realized losses if you think I'm BS. Thanks for reading this or just the TLDR. Looking forward to discussion!",0.5416,NEGATIVE,0.9998
My views on why NVDA beats earnings and flies to higher supports Likley past 200.csv,"For the PE bitchers and moaners, I leave you this: AMD Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 126 NVDA Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 69 Chanos bitched and moaned all the way to the broke house where he had to close shop. Tesla preaching and evangelizing the PE did him an apostate. He's done. TESLA CRUSHED HIM. Tesla easily slid into it's PE and Chanos is no more. Same thing happened with the bitchers and moaners with Amazon, Google, etc. When a company is a quality company and especially part of the SP500, where every iteration of that index HAS TO PURCHASE this stock, you ride well, and the company easily slides well into it's PE very well and snuggly like. Just like Zuckerberg sucker punched Open AI LLM's by making it's LLM open source and scorching the Earth, So goes NVDA: Open sourcing their DATA CENTER TECH, ( a little secret, its not just about the GPU, it's the entire package, it's not just about BLACKWELL GPU. But Rack/ Data Center Tech Design and Architecture, there will BE ZERO INCENTIVE FOR CUSTOMERS TO GO TO COMPETITORS WHEN RACK ARCHITECTURE THAT FITS BLACKWELL GPU's with ZERO ISSUE, IS COMPLETELY OUT IN THE OPEN: READ SUMMARY( this is why AMD and INTEL are having such a hard time competing and frankly anybody else, unless you're DELL and WORKING with Jensen...

A plateau and lower business revenues based on estimates that TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT INFERENCE IS LESS DEMANDING THAN TRAINING. THAT BEING SAID, MARKET IS NO LONGER LOOKING FOR INSANE NUCLEAR GROWTH. BUT STEADY HEALTHY GROWTH. THAT** WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. Crazy AI nuclear growth, is not what the market is expecting. Market is expecting a healthy stable growth, now that we are near equilibrium with AI and chips, ( this is obviously not true, but it's the arguments bears try to hang on. They think Amazon will overtake a 30 year CUDA industry software environment the entire world/industry has created THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AROUND). Go look up CUDA. It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four... NVDA continues to climb on growth, steady healthy growth, not insane nuclear growth. THAT WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. It has no where else to go. Ive's and Wedbush, are ENTIRELY correct. Dan Ives and Josh Brown Discuss NVDA https://youtu.be/u-95RKiEl5o?si=8Cpbr3LFWE9WsVju Lastly NVDA will own the entire vertical from Hyperscaler to Retail Individual end user level, why? NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming Latest Sept 2025, with my guess, Jensen starts marketing from first half of 2025, and wider release commercially of NVDA CPU for 1st qtr of 2026, March, me thinks Jensen starts getting market ready all of 2025 for release in the wild September 2025 for retail user and full wider release by March 2026 / end of February 2026. Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?.. I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about. And as far as I know, Biden or Trump won't block sales of regular computer pc windows chips to China or anywhere else for that matter. :) Imagine being the king of accelerated compute and now you have a cpu + gpu combo ARM chip that runs silent like Apple M chips and sips low power like such, but games and does AI and any heavy compute intense task very wicked like, very retail level computer chip level like that is specifically from the box ready to work with cuda and marry with existing nvidia gpu's at the hyperscaler level to even more efficiently run AI intense software and on prem (on the laptop or pc itself without cloud compute help, like QCOM snapdragon Elite PC boasts it can do(but sucks, incompatible with lots of software and games, not so with nvda).

NVDA has been all the rage and justifiably so.csv,"Since NVDA reporter its Q1 2023 earnings, revealing huge demand for AI chips, the stock has surged to $3.3T. Revenues 4x, margins up expanded and everything seemed perfect. Bulls claimed the stock was getting cheaper to decelerating growth. Quarterly revenue growth has dropped from 88% to 34% to 18%, heading towards single digits. Next quarter we’ll see just 7%. All of the marginal buyers are in — sucking the last few retail buyers in with the lure of a split. History suggests short term bump after a split as we are seeing, but now institutional investors have a vast pool to distribute their shares in coming months. As the saying goes, “when the ducks are quacking, feed them.” If the quarterly revenue growth continues to moderate, earnings growth will be impacted as well — making the stock become more and more “expensive” (multiple screams higher) versus the theme of last year when the higher it climbed the “cheaper” it got. This does not change the fact that it is a great business with a great leader — which will play a role in the advance of AI technologies and productivity. It’s just going to be a heavy lift that it retains a perception of greater value than Amazon, Microsoft or the entire German Stock Market Capitalizations (where it trades now). NVDA is still a semiconductor company, which has never been a secular business — it’s cyclical. Always has been, always will be. As for 70% gross margins, as Bezos famously said, “your margin is my opportunity.” NVDA has not cured cancer. There will be more and more competition going forward. Intel’s Gaudi 3 is 50% faster than NVDA’s H100 and 40% more energy efficient. AMD is gunning for them.

And then we have a rich, a very aggressive cadence of Falcon Shores products following that. We also added the Gaudi 3 PC IE card to it, this use case of Xeon plus an accelerator or Gaudi accelerator is getting very good response from customers as well.

"NVDA will hit 5T market cap in 2026, and 10T market cap before 2032.csv","Hi regards, This is not a ""copium"" post about the recent stock price drops. I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest. The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY. First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"". Name Stock price EPS SP/EPS ratio AAPL 230 1,4 164 MSFT 413 2,95 140 AMD 145 0,16 1.035 META 516 5,16 100 AMZN 171 1,26 135 NVDA 116 0,68 170 As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price. But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list. AAPL Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits. How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new. But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more. MSFT They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are. They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy. They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office? AMD I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first. Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware. Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software. And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section. META They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value. ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS. AMZN The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL. NVDA AND OUR STAR CHILD. HOT TOPIC OF 2024. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company. Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?

Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said: However, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive. For this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that a trillion dollars’ worth of general-purpose data centers will inevitably transition to accelerated computing. “We’re in a computer revolution,” Huang said, pointing out that the first wave of data center modernization is driven by generative AI, which he described as more than just a tool—it’s a skill. Huang also emphasized the need for “densification,” with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) aiming to make data centers more efficient by compressing them into smaller spaces. He discussed NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it. Nvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia. Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave. At Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range. Of course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.

Nvidia The only problem you're gonna have is that you didn't sell more.csv,"Introduction Alright, so Nvidia is crazy overvalued right now. Just check out its P/E ratio – it's sitting at a whopping 73.94. And that's not all. Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.55, and the price-to-sales ratio is over 42. These numbers are way above what you typically see for tech stocks and the semiconductor industry. There are two big reasons why Nvidia's stock might take a hit: growing competition and lowered margins. Growing Competition First off, the competition is heating up big time. 🔥 AMD's MI300 series is a beast, merging CPU and GPU on the same chip, which is great for performance and energy efficiency. This is super important for data centers and AI applications, and it could seriously cut into Nvidia's market share. AMD is coming in hot, and Nvidia might end up feeling the burn. Then you've got Intel with their Gaudi3 GPU, which is packing some serious performance and efficiency for AI and machine learning tasks. More people might start switching to Intel's GPUs, giving Nvidia a run for its money. Intel's Gaudi3 could be the ghost in Nvidia's machine👻 Lowered Margins Then there's Amazon, which is throwing its hat into the ring with custom GPUs for their EC2 instances. These GPUs are optimized for machine learning and AI, and they integrate perfectly with Amazon's cloud services. This seamless integration could mean less reliance on Nvidia's products, pushing Nvidia to cut prices to stay competitive. Lower prices mean lower margins, which isn't great for Nvidia's bottom line. Amazon could very well turn Nvidia's margins into margin call memes. 📉 Adding to the heat, TSMC is thinking about jacking up production fees for Nvidia. The chairman's plans to raise prices could eat away at Nvidia's margins even more. If TSMC hikes those fees, Nvidia might have to dig deeper into their pockets, and that could be a real pain in the margins. 💸 Link (06/04) So yeah, Nvidia's stock might be flying high right now, but with all this competition and pressure on margins, it might not stay that way for long. It's looking like Nvidia might be headed from tendies to tears if they can't keep up. 😂 TL;DR Nvidia is trading high, but AMD, Intel, and Amazon are bringing the heat. 🔥 Competition + TSMC price hikes = potential margin squeeze. Stock might go from 🚀 to 💥 if they don't keep up. 😂",0.5456,NEGATIVE,0.9812
Nvidia's Blackwell Delay Offers Investors A Chance To 'Add To Positions' says Goldman Sachs.csv,"Nvidia Corp (NVDA) finds itself at the center of tech speculation as reports have surfaced about potential delays in its much-anticipated Blackwell architecture. With tech giants like Nvidia often facing the heat of public and market scrutiny, the slightest hiccup can stir investor unease. But is this delay really a cause for concern, or just a blip on Nvidia’s otherwise smooth journey towards AI supremacy? According to a report by The Information, Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell chips might hit a speed bump, delaying their release by over three months due to alleged design flaws. These chips were set to ship later this year, boasting promises of up to 30x better Inference performance over their predecessors. Despite this setback, Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs advises investors to remain calm and continue with their current strategies. The delay, while not ideal, is unlikely to impact Nvidia's 2025 earnings power or its market dominance, according to Hari. “We expect there to be little to no impact on CY2025 earnings and, most importantly, the company's long-term competitive position.” Hari believes that any short-term volatility in Nvidia's fundamentals will be just that—short-lived. The Market Reaction: Opportunity or Overreaction? For those ready to jump ship, Hari's advice is clear: stay the course. Nvidia's stock might experience some turbulence, but the company’s strong footing in the AI market isn't going anywhere. “We would consider any near-term dislocation in the stock as an opportunity to add to positions.” Despite a recent 15% correction, Nvidia remains a top pick, firmly seated on Goldman's Americas Conviction List with a 12-month price target of $135, suggesting a potential upside of nearly 26%. Even with Blackwell’s reported delays, Nvidia’s projected 39% year-over-year growth in 2025 remains unchanged. Hari’s bullish stance is rooted in Nvidia’s role as a crucial player in the rapidly evolving AI sector, especially as the demand for advanced AI infrastructure shows no signs of slowing down. Implications for Rival – AMD Interestingly, while the Blackwell delays might appear as a dark cloud over Nvidia, there could be a silver lining for competitors like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (AMD). “We believe the market could perceive this development as a marginal positive for AMD — the only alternative to Nvidia today in Data Center GPUs.” Although the analysts say AMD is unlikely to overtake Nvidia due to Nvidia’s strong market position and AMD’s challenges in scaling operations, this situation could still present a competitive boost for AMD. What’s Next for Nvidia? In the tech world, where speed and innovation reign supreme, a three-month delay might seem significant. However, Nvidia’s legacy of innovation and market leadership paints a different picture. As Hari points out, “any impact to CY2025 earnings will be negligible,” and the temporary setback should not deter investors from seeing Nvidia’s long-term value. For now, Nvidia’s strategy remains rock solid. The potential delay, whether factual or exaggerated, is but a temporary hurdle, according to Hari. As Nvidia navigates this challenge, the market watches closely, with many investors seeing a buying opportunity amid the noise. For those invested in Nvidia's future, Hari’s message is clear: hold steady, as the AI revolution waits for no one.",0.5505,NEGATIVE,0.9994
NVIDIA's share price surge and the outlook for the AI arithmetic market bubble risk and rational lay.csv,"As NVIDIA's share price has risen sharply in the short term, many have begun to wonder if the industry is facing a turning point or if there is a bubble. From the perspective of the industry giants, GPUs, as representatives of A1 arithmetic chips, are currently far from meeting demand. We can assume that AI applications are still only in their infancy, and there has not yet been a particularly prominent Al burst application in the world. Analyse the results: The AI market is still at an early stage: AI applications, despite explosive growth in recent years, are still at an early stage. The arithmetic power required for current AI applications (e.g., big language modelling, autonomous driving, robotics, etc.), especially GPUs, is still in the pre-burst stage. The growth of Tesla and the robotics industry, for example, predicts that billions of robots will be needed in the future for arithmetic support. This means that there is a huge potential for growth in AI arithmetic demand over the next few years, especially in inferential computing. GPUs as core hardware for AI: GPUs play a key role in AI inference computing, especially in tasks that require high parallel processing power (e.g., deep learning inference, autonomous driving, robot control, etc.). Although there are already many GPU products on the market, overall, the demand for AI computing power is still in a state of oversupply, and the size of the AI computing power market is likely to continue to expand, especially in the ‘reasoning’ segment of the demand for this segment is the area of high computation, especially in the field of automated driving, cloud computing and so on. Personal view: NVIDIA's leadership in the GPU space is well recognised, but many are beginning to worry about an industry bubble due to the short-term surge in its share price. NVIDIA's dominant position: Currently, NVIDIA is the almost unrivalled leader in the field of AI hardware (especially GPUs), and its products are widely used in AI training and reasoning calculations, especially playing a central role in large-scale data centres and cloud services. NVIDIA's rising share price reflects investors' optimistic expectations about the potential of the AI market. Bubble Risk: As NVIDIA's share price has surged, the market has become sceptical about whether it is overvalued. NVIDIA's high valuation could lead to the formation of a bubble, especially if its products and technologies are not sufficiently digested by the market. While the AI industry is promising, the market is volatile in the short term and the rise of competitors (e.g. AMD) could change the market landscape. Therefore, investors and industry observers need to be wary of market overheating and short-term speculation. Core view: US tech giants (e.g. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook) are supportive of NVIDIA's technology, but they will also support NVIDIA's competitors, such as AMD, in order to avoid the arithmetic market being monopolised by one company and to ensure the sustainable development of the industry. Analyse the results: Rational rather than short-term profit-driven: the behaviour of these tech giants suggests that they are not simply pursuing short-term profit when purchasing AI arithmetic, but are planning the security and sustainability of their own development in the long term. By supporting competitors such as AMD, these companies avoid the risk of the market becoming too dependent on NVIDIA alone, ensuring diversity in market competition and technological innovation. This kind of rational decision-making is crucial to the healthy development of the AI hardware market. If NVIDIA dominates the AI arithmetic market without competitive pressure, it could lead to overpricing, affecting the interests of other tech giants. As a result, companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon prefer to ensure diversity and healthy competition in the AI arithmetic market by supporting competitors such as AMD. In summary: future outlook and risks Huge potential for AI arithmetic: The demand for AI arithmetic is far from reaching its ceiling, especially in the area of inferential computing, and the market demand for GPUs will continue to grow as robotics and autonomous driving technologies evolve. The adoption of AI technologies will generate even more demand for arithmetic power in the coming decades, especially in emerging technologies such as robotics and autonomous driving. NVIDIA's dominance and risks: While NVIDIA's dominance in the AI hardware space cannot be ignored, the sharp rise in its share price and high market valuation have raised concerns about the existence of a bubble. Future technological competition, especially the rise of competitors such as AMD, may affect NVIDIA's market share. Long-term layout of industry giants: U.S. tech giants are very rational when investing in AI arithmetic, they will not simply pursue short-term benefits, but pay more attention to the diversity of the arithmetic market and the sustainability of the technology, to ensure that they can be invincible in the competition in the coming years. The AI arithmetic market is full of great potential, but is still in the early stages of development. While NVIDIA occupies a leading position in the AI hardware market, its high valuation and share price volatility also make the risk of a bubble",0.5575,POSITIVE,0.7135
NVIDIA’s next catalyst has to be sovereign AI.csv,"NVIDIA’s current valuation is not overtly expensive (FPER: 33, PEG: 1.61 according to FINVIZ) and the GPU orders for next year are all booked. Yet the stock is meeting strong resistance around $130. I think this is partially because a lot of people have been burned by CISCO during dot-com bubble and do not want to price in the future too much. But the real concern is that their revenue is almost entirely dependent on the rest of M7 and they are charging the big tech 80 % margin. The big tech, while being hammered by Wall Street for the increased CAPEX spending, indicated during last earning that they will not reduce their investment on AI. However, they did mention that they are/plan using their NPU (Google TPU, Tesla Dojo, AMD) to reduce the usage of NVIDIA GPU. Furthermore, GPT5 and Apple Intelligence should be available to the public by the end of this year. If these do not impress, the entire AI sector may see significant slowdown. But if GPT5 shows plateauing of performance while people find Apple Intelligence interesting, paradigm could shift toward smaller models and inference efficiency, again reducing the demand for NVIDIA. To justify significant increase in NVIDIA’s stock price, they need to show that they are not entirely dependent on the Big Tech. The only other potential buyers that have as much buying power are governments. Also, if the economy is going through downturns, governments have excuse to increase their spending. What I am paying attention to during the earning call is demonstration from NVIDIA that they are receiving significant demand from non-Big Tech such as governments.",0.5529,NEGATIVE,0.9994

Short Call Strategy Am I Regarded or Might This Actually Work.csv,"Okay, so I'm guessing a good amount of us in this subreddit were new to options trading at some point in time, and when we were just itty bitty option noobs first hearing about them, we just thought: "" Wow! this is just the same thing as betting on stocks but with leverage right?"" (might just be me when I first got into options trading but whatever). Moving on. I assume that many people's first instinct was to go and buy a call on a stock they were very bullish on. And I would assume that once we did that, we lost the entire position because we never knew how theta decay, IV, DTE, strike price, and other factors could sink your entire position. The thing about these factors is that when you buy a call, the majority of these factors are stacked against you, and if you don't want them to be completely stacked against you, you gotta pay up for a higher premium which is gonna yield the same or less of a return then the lower priced (but considerably more risky) options. You're paying for less risk. Long Calls are usually only profitable when the underlying has a significant enough uptick to outweigh all the other factors dragging down the value of the option. I'm sorry I don't mean to repeat the basics of valuing options but I think it's important to pretext them a little bit so my strategy makes more sense in the grand scheme of things. Okay, so my strategy is as follows: why buy a call, and have all of these factors stacked against you, when you can sell one, and have them work in your favor; I guess the whole basis is: the shittier the call, the better (meaning how likely it is to expire or be exercised with no value). The even better thing is we can magnify the shittiness to work in our favor on the sell side by selling balls deep out of the money calls, with low IV, and few DTE. And we can magnify this even further by selling calls on options with really shitty stocks underlying; stocks that are down 40% YTD, or just really, really stagnant not moving anywhere (might also get some sexy low IV to work in your favor there too). I don't really have any stocks in mind right now to lock this trade in off the top of my head, but $NOC and $AMD are quite down this last month and a half, and are relatively popular stocks. Like I said I need to find some better stocks for this Strat; these are not the ones I wanna go with, just what I thought of off the top of my head Now you might be saying two things: 1. ""The prices on them are probably gonna be pennies on the dollar. Sure the odds might be in your favor, but the yield is gonna be very low"", and 2. ""What fucking moron is gonna be stupid enough to buy these calls?"". To answer question 1: Why not just sell more calls? And to answer question 2: I don't think I need to illustrate the stupidity of individuals in the market, but if you need me to, here you go: WSB regards (not dissing, I am also a WSB regard who has lost thousands on YOLOs), teenagers with a Robinhood account that just found out about options, and maybe even people who are legit investors, but have bought the call as a part of some bigger options play, like a straddle, or iron condor (not to mention that in the example of the straddle, I don't think they would really give a shit if the call tanked because, well, it's a straddle lol, the put on the other side would cover the losses and make profit{and yeah there are probably more plays where this is the case that I am just forgetting about, but this is the example I'm just gonna go with for now}). Not to mention markets are huge and I've checked the open interest on some of these calls and there are hundreds going up to the thousands in open interest on balls deep OTM, 2DTE, Low IV call options. Anyways, I guess the reason I made this post is to double check with some options veteran (I've been into options for a little less than a year, but I have some knowledge on them from my job) to see if this strategy is complete delusional manic retardation, or if there is actually some substance to it. I wanna make sure there isn't some variable or factor I'm not accounting for that could tank this entire play.

The company also had stated that they want to supply 1000 liquid cooling racks per month, and increase their 1% market share to 15% within the next 12 months.

Strong AI and Semiconductor weeks ahead.csv,"Hi all, I think that AI and esp. Semiconductor Stocks have a couple of strong weeks ahead. Starting on Tuesday, October 15th 2024, the Open Compute Project (OCP) global summit takes place in San Jose, California. Between 9 AM and 11:30 AM there'll be short keynotes (each 12 mins) presented by Meta, NVidia, AI Clusters, Intel, AMD, Microsoft and Google (full schedule here). Now, I don't think that there'll be any big surprises. But the Summit still presents an opportunity for public remarks about how strong the demand is or what so ever. Also, there's an article that says that Broadcom (AVGO) is going to show case cutting-edge AI infrastructure. Further it is expected that Taiwan Semiconductor Company (TSM) and ASML Holding (ASML) will publish their Q3 earnings next week. TSM will present its earnings on October 17th 2024 at 14:00 Taiwan time / 02:00 Eastern Time. So pre-market movements will most likely be wild on Thursday as a large part of the industry relies on TSM. If TSM reports a great Q3 revenue, this could push Nvidia over the current all time high. Also according to Moore's law is dead, the first RTX 5000 series GPUs are ready to be sold, but are not released because of business reasons (here at 22:22). So they could still change their mind and ship in Q4. Next, it is rumored (by moore's law is dead) that AMD will release a new CPU by the end of October or early November, the 9800X3D which is an 8 Core Gaming CPU with 3D cache and it is expected that it will be the fastest gaming CPU releasing this year. Although Client is not as important for AMD, it will still be beneficial to have this CPU released before the holiday season. Especially since Zen5 Rysen has so far been viewed as rather disappointing. Moore's law is dead also mentions an RX 7650 GRE GPU, which could launch alongside Ryzen 9800X3D. Releasing a slightly refreshed and cheap RDNA3 GPU could be a good move by AMD to get rid of RDNA3 stock ahead of the RDNA4 launch in 2025. Since the Ryzen 9800X3D has not yet been anounced, I don't think that it has been priced in and could give the stock a slight boost to recover from the -4% last Thursday. Also, I although Investors were not excited about AMDs Advancing AI event, I think AMDs position in the market is still solid. According to the slides shown at the event, AMD Epic has increased its market share to 34%. And according to tests AMD Epyc Turin obliterates Xeon 6 Granite Rapids, while being cheaper. Because of this, I think AMD is in a good position to gain more server market share. Further, the news about Nvidia Blackwell being sold out for the next 12 Months is not only good news for Nvidia but also for AMD. Sure, everyone wants blackwell. but if one can't get blackwell and if AMD Instinct MI325X is faster than Nvidia Hopper (H200), then they might be able to win over customers from nvidia, who would like to buy blackwell but can't in due time. Also, AMDs earnings should be reported on October 29 2024. Due to Ryzen Zen5 being disappointing and there being apparently a large RDNA3 stock remaining. If AMDs Instinct systems are selling well, this would also be good news for Micron Industries (MU), which produces high bandwith memory (HBM3e). And then there's Intel. Their newest releases seem to have been disappointing. But they claim to be making progress with their foundries.

They are frequently gamers, so they need to buy NVDA GPUs and AMD CPUs. They often buy these at AMZN. They buy YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, so they can skip the ads of their fellow influencers (GOOGL) They spent most of their waking hours at META's Instagram website. They drive a TSLA or RIVN. They're on the GLP-1 drug (LLY) to impress their SOs. They're churning their credit cards with AXP Platinum and Gold, JPM's Chase Sapphire Preffered (no, NOT Reserve), some younger ones need to rely on COF's Venture and Venture X cards that gave nice ""subs"". They use these cards frequently to eat out and earn those points at CMG, SHAK and SG. They're flying a lot on DAL, and they need their free wifi that is often sponsored by their preferred choice of mobile carrier, TMUS. To get to the airport they need to use UBER or LYFT, since they don't want to drive their sweet electric ride. When they arrive at their destination airport, they pick up their rental car, and of course they prefer AVIS (CAR), but their credit cards give them presential circle status on HTZ, so they are ok with that too. They check into their hotel room at Marriott (MAR) to impress their friends, but really they are using all their Chase points to book Hyatt (H) hotels. The slightly less premium young ones will have to go Hilton (HLT) and fly on UAL. They often booked all this travel on EXPE or BKNG. Sometimes they use ABNB.

"The next tech giant Why HOOD, PLTR and DKNG are the investment opportunities of a lifetime (Part 1).csv","I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong. $AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice. $NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were. And so in true wsb fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB. There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long. From a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about. And so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry : If you are under 40 years old, $HOOD (Finance), $PLTR (Defense) and $DKNG (gambling) will 100x during your investment horizon.

The short report for Intel (INTC) - A rabbit hole of CPU failures rate since 2022.csv,"Forenote: Im a technical person, A developer, this will be a technical DD to show how intel is failing to do their basic business model of manufacturing CPUs. Over the past month or so Intels customers have been becoming increasing irrate about CPUs just flat out dying after various finger pointing from Intel being debunked. I first caught wind of intels failures when a friends system started to become unstable, he would crash in games and sometimes doing mundane tasks. It all came to a clicking point when his systems files started becoming corrupted and he needed to attempt reinstalling windows. The attempts failed, windows couldnt even install without corrupted files, sometimes it would install and look fine, but running a verification shows that various system files were still corrupted but not important enough for the system to boot successfully. He would still get various crashes doing mundane things and gaming. It was basically a working brick at this point. So i got my research hat on, and discovered various reddit users on r/pcmasterrace were also reporting instability with their PCs. Not alot tho, this has been the wierd thing, Intel has such a large CPU failure rate, but not alot of reports which caught everyone by suprise. It started to make sense, the causes of the crashes were different for everything. Users were reporting issues with Nvidia, Issues with RAM, and issues with corrupted data. Obviously to any layman, these issues dont instantly point to an issue with the CPU. With GPU errors, Nvidia initially got heat, but Nvidia quickly debunked the issue reporting the GPUs that were returned were fully functional and had no issues. So I pulled out my handy dandy debug tools since my friend managed to get windows installed and it kinda runs. The first tests I ran were memory block verification. This validates that the memory is able to hold data immutably, after 4 hours the tests finished all green, the memory was stable and wasnt corrupting data. (its worth noting that the memory test software I used was very CPU lite so the CPU has little chance to corrupt the data its self, this is a stark difference to the Drive tests I ran.). Since my friend was getting corrupted files almost everytime he install anything, I ran the disk debug tools, these pull the S.M.A.R.T data from the drive and run various read and write tests. The S.M.A.R.T data came back green, the drive was reporting it had no errors or irregularies and was functioning fine, So i moved to the read and write tests, all red, the drive had a 90% file currption rate, I pulled the S.M.A.R.T data again, All green, the drive was still reporting it was functioning correctly. At this point, anyone would deduce they had a bad drive that was misbehaving, leading to the decreased number of CPU failure reports. After all, How can you say the CPU is bad when you have corrupt files? Many people forget how much the CPU is responsable for. When you read files or write files, its the CPU that tells the Drive what to store and where and what to read and where it is on the disk to read it from. and as i said, the software I used to test the drives is CPU intensive, it uses the the CPU to generate random data to store on the drive and hashes that data to verify it. So a bad CPU = Currupted data on the drive. Luckly my friend has 4 drives, So I told him to take out the ""bad"" drive and put in another one, I ran all my tests again and same result, the drive was reporting it was functional, but all the data was corrupted. The result was the same with all the drives tested. Now, this is a luxary many people dont have. Many people would get corrupted data on their drive and think the drive is dying and get a new one. However with 4 tests samples all failing the same way when days ago they were all fine is a very low chance. Now for the kicker, Intel has a tool to verify that the Intel CPU you have is a genuine Intel CPU, I guess intel has a problem of china making fake intel CPUs??? Ive never seen any but what the hell, its a useful tools since its does some basic CPU level checks. So i ran the verifier tool and its first test for a genuine CPU comes back green, Cool, it is a real Intel CPU. Memory test comes back green (We alreadt tested this soo good), next was the Graphics tests. Failed, the CPU was attempting to send data to the GPU and it corrupted the GPU memory. So now we have 2 symptoms. Disk data corruption GPU memory corruption My friend has Nvidia GPU and Nvidia previously debunked any issues with their GPUs. But we have a common cause, Intel CPUs are corrupting data when sending it to another device in the system (except RAM), Data sent to a disk gets corrupted and data sent to the GPU gets corrupted, which would explain the game crashes. Various other tests passed from boost speed changing, Wifi tests and math operations. After I finished all the tests and determed the issue is with the CPU, my friend RMA'd the CPU. This is where more troubles start. Intel refused the RMA, citing user damage, According to intel all the issues my friend was having was his fault and he caused the damage, After it was refused, I filed the RMA for him, to the same response, but because im a stickler I pushed for more info, Intel was refusing the RMA because of overclocking done by the motherboard. This is a previous blame game intel played, they were blaming Motherboards for putting in stock overclocks on CPUs causing them to fail, but this wasnt the case with my friend, his motherboard wasnt even stock overclocked, but intel refused it anyway. After this point is when the waterfall started coming down, a advanced tech-youtuber posted an exposé about intels CPU failures. See: Intel has a HUGE problem - Level1Tech the curtains were starting to fall, Apparently Game developers and datacenters (Intels BIGGEST customers) were getting large amounts of CPU failures specificly with intel CPUs. Now datacenters are normally quiet about this type of thing, opting to sort their issues directly with intel, but intel is turning away datacenters RMA's of thousands of CPUs, these datacenters has since publicly reported they are dropping intel systems from their products and only supporting AMD systems from now on. Intel has lost their largest customer base, because of their defective products and refusing to take responsability for the product inherit flaw. Intel is hoping this goes unnoticed, since reports are still low of CPUs failing because the errors are random and different each time and users dont know their CPU is defective, there isnt a big in your face ""The Intel CPU in this system has errored"" its always an error with something else, which is caused by the CPU. So intel is betting on customers blaming other manufactures like they did with Nvidia when this all started. Timeline of events: [Dec 2022] The first instances of ""Out of Video Memory"" issues on 13th Gen Core i9 CPUs were reported back in 2022. (Source: Reddit). This is a few months after the release of Intel's 13th Gen CPUs & RTX 40 GPUs. [Throughout 2023] Several users have started reporting game crashes and issues in high-profile AAA titles such as Callisto Protocol and Hogwarts Legacy (among many others). Both tiles are based on Unreal Engine (released in 2023) and feature a shader compilation process at the start. There are currently thousands of such issues reported on Steam Community Forums and Reddit. [February 2024] A post by Sebastian Castellanos brings the issue to the limelight, highlighting the ""worrying trend"" of stability issues affecting 14th and 13th-gen CPUs. [February 2024] Our editor along with various other tech outlets start reporting the issue and bringing the matter on to the mainstream media. Quickly, it is pointed out that underclocking and undervolting the chips can result in better stability. [April 2024] NVIDIA Issued a formal statement that the stability issues are not related to its GPUs but rather Intel CPUs. [April 2024] Intel announces its investigation of the reports of instability issues affecting 13th and 14th Gen CPUs. [April 2024] Oodle Publishes about their discovery about users Intel systems experiencing data corruption. [April 2024] Motherboard makers quickly roll out ""Baseline"" power profiles in new BIOS, which lower power limits on high-end 14th & 13th Gen CPUs but also lead to significant performance drops. [May 2024] Intel releases a statement, recommending motherboard makers to ship ""Intel Default Settings"" in BIOS by default rather than customized settings. [June 2024] Intel discovers a bug within its eTVB microcode while investigating the root cause of 14th and 13th Gen Instability issues. This doesn't fix the instability problems. Board makers quickly roll out BIOS with a new microcode fix. [June 2024] Alderon Games publishes about there players, developers and servers Intel CPUs failing over a period of months and switch to only AMD systems. [July 2024] Intel denies an RMA to HardwareTimes editor who already RMA'd at least two CPUs which produced instability issues. [July 2024] Wendell from Level1Techs & Steve Burke from GamersNexus are the first big tech media outlets on YouTube to further highlight the instability issues, diving into additional details such as OEM frustration with the matter and a possible recall. [July 2024] GamersNexus highlights a potential ""oxidation"" defect being a problem with a certain batch of Intel 14th & 13th Gen CPUs that might lead to instability problems. [July 2024] Intel says the 14th & 13th Gen Mobile CPUs are not affected by the same instability issues as the desktop CPUs. [July 2024] GamersNexus reports they will not be recommending Intel CPUs regardless of the outcome for upcoming AMD 9000 series reviews [July 2024] Intel issues a statement confirming that they have found the root cause of the instability issues which happen to be elevated operating voltages and will be issuing a new microcode fix to its partners by mid of August [July 2024] Users are reporting instability issues with Intel 14th gen Laptop CPUs. [July 2024] ModelFarm (A movie VFX studio) publishes their Intel systems expereinced a 50% failure rate and they are moving all systems to AMD [July 2024] Intel announces the Microcode update they pushed does not fix the issues and will not be accepting RMA's or doing a recall for effected CPUs I have been short Intel since July 15th. Edit: Ive received internal leaks from Intel employees explaining internal issues and intels failures. Source 1: The leading theory inside Intel right now, and it is just a theory, is that the Ring Bus is getting cooked because it's fed by the same rail as the P-Cores and E-Cores. Raptor Lake required incredibly high voltages that the clocks required to be competitive with Zen 4, and it seems like it was just pushed too hard. This is an inherent flaw that would be in Bartlett too it's overvolted. Meteor Lake isn't affected, and Emerald Rapids is unlikely be effected materially. Source 2: I never worked directly on Raptor Lake [Intel Design Engineer], but I did have exposure to Alder Lake, and I can confirm that they were very concerned about the ring bus getting damaged if the voltage was pushed too high. I can also confirm that Raptor Lake was rushed through the design and validation process... Source 3: I [Intel Foundry Services] can tell you that Raptor Lake was rushed through our Fab in Arizona in record time, but it's also produced in other fabs. However, this location (Arizona) is notable because I can confirm that there was an Oxidation issue caused by some failure in our HVAC system between March & June of 2023. It was so bad that Keyvan Esfarjani had to fly in to make decision about which wafers (which cost as much as a Model X each) needed to be thrown away. To be clear, I don't know what decision was made, but I do know that this event DID happen. And by the way, it affected Sapphire Rapids yields as well...although I doubt it's an issue that wasn't",0.5221,NEGATIVE,0.9929
The Worst Start of August Since January 2016.csv,"JP Morgan economist Bruce Kasman commented that aside from maintaining a 45% chance of a recession in the U.S. next year, he has also raised the likelihood of the U.S. economy entering a recession by the end of this year to 35%! This probability is higher than the 25% at the beginning of July, mainly due to various data indicating that the demand for labor is weakening more severely than expected, with initial signs of layoffs already appearing! JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon also stated that a U.S. recession is the most likely scenario, with the chance of a soft landing being between 35% and 40%! Multiple economists have expressed their views, casting doubt over the economic rebound and causing U.S. stocks to open high but close low last night. 👉 The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 230 points, and the S&P 500 index dropped by about 0.8%!

Yes while the main points of the short report were not mentioned and intel continues to hide this infomation from Investors, they cant ignore the impact it has on their bottom line. RMA's are not cheap and the amount of money and time they are spending to fix the issue for existing chips while trying their hardest to deny RMAs for failed CPUs. Customers have lost faith in Intel, their chips are constantly beaten by AMD offerings and having a high failure rate really was the last nail in the coffin. Enterprise customers are switching, gamers are switching, datacetners are switching. All switching to AMD (or Arm - Yes Arm is starting to see some enterprise deployments, very little tho.)

VSH - The Forgotten King of Chips.csv,"TLDR: $VSH (Vishay Intertechnology) is printing money while everyone sleeps on it. $VSH just got the stamp of approval from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, confirming it as a hidden winner in Nvidia’s AI and RTX 50 supply chain. With key wins in MOSFETs, capacitors, and resistors, $VSH is now primed for explosive growth, riding Nvidia’s dominance in AI servers and GPUs. If you’re not jacked up on $VSH, you’re not meant to have money. Who is $VSH? Vishay Intertechnology is a veteran in the electronics industry. They make essential components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and semiconductors. You know, the boring stuff that makes your GPU, PS5, and electric toothbrush actually work. They’ve been doing this since 1962. That’s right, this company has survived every market downturn, bubble, and chip shortage in the last 60+ years. Meanwhile, you can’t even survive a red day on SPY. Why $VSH is printing money: Chips are everywhere—cars, phones, smart homes, AI servers. The global semiconductor market is growing at an insane pace (projected $1 trillion market by 2030). Guess what? Vishay is supplying the guts. Look at their P/E ratio: 12.5 (as of last check). Compare that to Nvidia’s 75+ or AMD’s 30-ish. $VSH is practically trading at the bargain bin, and yet their revenues are consistently strong. Vishay’s last earnings report crushed expectations, with double-digit growth in several segments. They’re sitting on $3.4B in annual revenue with plans to scale. Oh, and they’re buying back shares like they’re on clearance at Costco. Everyone’s hyped about Nvidia because of AI. Guess what? Vishay supplies components used in AI hardware, EV charging stations, and industrial automation. While Nvidia makes the sexy GPUs, Vishay sells the boring but essential resistors and capacitors that keep those GPUs from melting your motherboard. They’re eating up the market share. Recent Catalysts: Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo dropped a bombshell: Vishay is a key supplier for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI servers (GB200 series, DGX/HGX B200) and the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. These are Nvidia’s future bread-and-butter products, dominating AI and high-end gaming. Vishay replaced Infineon as Nvidia’s MOSFET supplier. Yes, Infineon, the semiconductor giant, just got sidelined. This Is MASSIVE for $VSH. Vishay is providing MOSFET/DrMOS (VRPower), vPolyTan (Polymer Tantalum Capacitors), and Current Shunt Resistors. These components are critical for Nvidia’s most cutting-edge products: • GB200 series AI servers: Nvidia’s next-gen AI infrastructure. • RTX 50 series GPUs: The next flagship graphics cards. Vishay’s vPolyTan capacitors (especially the T55 series) are already facing a supply crunch for 2025. That’s how in-demand they are. Kuo estimates that Vishay’s MOSFET production alone will contribute 20%-30% of revenue by 2025—with above-average gross profit margins. The vPolyTan capacitors will add a high single-digit percentage of revenue with significantly above-average margins. Translation? Vishay is printing money. Vishay’s production lines are already at capacity through 2025. When your biggest challenge is meeting demand, you’re in a good spot. Beyond Nvidia, Vishay is also poised to benefit from: • Automotive rebound: As EV production scales, Vishay’s components are critical. • IoT growth: Billions of devices mean billions of tiny components. Vishay is at the center of it. The Stock Is Still Cheap Even after today’s 7% jump to $18.35, $VSH is wildly undervalued. As I said earlier, the P/E ratio is still around 12-13, compared to Nvidia’s 75+. This is a company with real earnings, real dividends, and real growth potential. This is a great opportunity to make back everything you lost from your MSTR calls. Positions: Shares, 01/17/25 20C",0.5352,POSITIVE,0.9824

I’m not saying this is right but there’s a lot of inconsistencies you should consider. I know everyone is going to say I’m wrong but I’ve correctly pointed AMD rise, INTC demise (this I am reminded every week that INTC is a value play but Intel has fallen every year for 6 years), NVDA becoming the most valuable company, SMCI scam.

"Weekly jobless claims fall to 233,000, less than expected, in a positive sign for labor market.csv","Last night, the U.S. announced that the number of initial unemployment claims for last week was 233,000, significantly lower than the previous week's 249,000 and also below the market's expectation of 240,000! A few days ago, Mr. Wang mentioned that for the U.S. stock market to stop declining, the economic and labor data released must continue to be strong in order to ease concerns about a potential economic recession. Yesterday's sharp drop in initial unemployment claims marked the largest decrease in a year, indicating that the number of people recently unemployed has decreased. This alleviated the recession concerns raised by last Friday's non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate data, spurring a rally in U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 index surging over 2.3%, the largest single-day gain in 21 months 📈. On the other hand, the demand for the 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds at the auctions over the past two days was poor, causing the 10-year yield to exceed 4% once again! Tech giants saw a broad rebound, with Meta rising 4.2%, Alphabet up 1.9%, Amazon gaining 1.8%, Apple increasing 1.6%, and Microsoft rebounding 1%. Nvidia surged over 6%, returning to the $100 mark, leading to a rebound in semiconductor stocks. Broadcom, Micron, and Applied Materials all jumped more than 6%, while Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and AMD all saw gains of over 5%! Taiwan's ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) also rebounded, with TSMC and UMC both jumping more than 6%, and ASE gaining over 4%. However, it's still important to note that the number of continuing unemployment claims is rising, reaching its highest level since November 2021, nearly three years ago!

Why I am going long on Intel and letting Bad Daddy Gelsinger take me to Uranus - DD TurboNerd Post.csv,"TLDR: This stock fucking sucks, and I love it. But the developing foundry business is gonna get absolutely bananas under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for the sole purpose of developing it. They are not gonna let the other chip companies continue to take nut shots on them and they are just gonna make everyone chips for them. Anyways I all in on Mar 2025 Calls (which are like $4.50 - $5.00) right now. Here is some DD. Dog of the Dow Intel has lagged behind other chip titans such as [[AMD - AMD]] and [[NVDA -NVIDIA]] as they race to design and build chips to handle [[AI]] workloads. Both AMD and NVIDA have seen tremendous growth over the past 18 months (as of June 2024). A growth pattern that has gone completely unanswered by INTEL up until this point. Looking at the [[Price to Earnings Ratio]] of both AMD and NVIDIA it is easy to see how disconnected from earnings they have become (though they are both incredibly profitable). AMD P/E Ratio: 67.30 NVIDIA P/E Ratio: 238.53 INTEL P/E Ratio 31.79 AMD is wildly inflated relative to its competition in the space. NVDA is has a more ""sane"" price to earnings but it has also been nearly printing its own money with the amount of sales it has been making. The price of NVIDIA still ""feels"" high despite it's recent split. Another interesting metric to take a look at is the [[Price/Tangible Book]] - Where you take the current price of the stock and compare it to the tangle value of all its assets minus good will. AMD P/TB Ratio: 23.61 NVIDIA P/TB Ratio: 64.73 INTEL P/TB Ratio: 1.75 This says a few things; One either Intel has barely any assets worth liquidating relative to its stock price and the market has priced the stock appropriately, OR the price of the stock is selling for a very reasonable price related to the actual value of the company. This could be considered paying only .75 above book value of the company as a ""premium"" for future expected value. Source: Any trading platform that has data you ding dongs - go look it up. I got these from Schwab jfc. Technical Except for this past Wednesday, this company has been hard stuck around $30 after a selloff from its 52 week high of $51.28. 31.50 appears to be the most reliable resistance level we can work off of right now, then $32.50 after that. If it breaks both of those on a run up, there is literally no ceiling until $46. SO, you tell me what that means. The further you zoom out on your shitty little trading app the more you will see that this period we are in is nothing but consolidation. Foundry Intel's new foundry business will be the corner stone of its future growth. Forget the in house made chips. The company is not-so-silently tyring to be the American version of TSMC.

Under this new structure, Intel Foundry will recognize revenues generated from both external foundry customers and Intel Products..."" Fuck me, if they pull this off under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for this specific function, this stock could easily moon. Not to mention this article detailing that NVIDIA will start using Intels Foundry to start making its own chips. https://www.techspot.com/news/101725-nvidia-turning-intel-foundry-services-expand-gpu-ai.html#:~:text=Nvidia%20could%20also%20choose%20to,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202024. Chips Act ""U.S. Department of Commerce has proposed up to $8.5 billion in direct funding through the CHIPS and Science Act to advance Intel’s commercial semiconductor projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon. Intel also expects to benefit from a U.S. Treasury Department Investment Tax Credit (ITC) of up to 25% on more than $100 billion in qualified investments and eligibility for federal loans up to $11 billion. Proposed funding supports Intel’s previously announced plans to invest more than $100 billion in the U.S. over five years to expand U.S. chipmaking capacity and capabilities critical to economic and national security and acceleration of emerging technologies, such as AI. Intel’s investments are expected to create more than 10,000 company jobs and nearly 20,000 construction jobs, and to support more than 50,000 indirect jobs with suppliers and supporting industries. "" https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/us-chips-act-intel-direct-funding.html#gs.a8z5ze So yea Intel is gonna get paid, and quite a bit. The article states that they are slated to receive up to $8.5 billion, with a B. X86 chips - Speculation With Arm taking dominance over portable computers like laptops, tablets and phones, X86 looks pretty boring. Except you have to remember that both AMD and Intel are still cranking these bad boys out like nobody's business. The raw horsepower in these for desktop workstations and servers is still not matched by ARM and probably wont be for quite a while. Sure they are not quite as power efficient, but who cares in a data center or major compute space anyways. Intel owns almost all of the IP for X86 processors too. AMD has a little bit and they have made improvements and designs of their own that they have been able to patent, but INTEL is the OG maker of these chips. Arm will probably continue to dominate the landscape, but they are the people who license their chips are going to need them made somewhere. They will have like two options. Intel or TSMC. China What happens when CHYNA pulls the trigger and takes over Taiwan. Where is everyone gonna have their chips made? Arizona, that's where. TSMC and Intel are both setting up MASSIVE Fabs there. So, when all the other chip companies get absolutely smoked I expect to see a giant green candle on that morning for INTC. I will probably write more later but this shit got way long way fast.

Why I bought Puts on MNST (Monster).csv,"Since Monster releases its earnings report after market, it’s time for some puts… or calls if you are based and want to inverse me Reason 1: High expectations - Current expectations for this quarterly are quite high.. Expected earnings per share are $0.452 as opposed to the $0.400 of a year ago . In this same light the market expects (has already priced in) a nearly 200 million dollar increase in revenue from the year prior.. Put quite simply these massive increases are already expected and priced in, and it’s much easier to fall short when expectations are this high Reason 2: Competition - PepsiCo is fighting hard for market share of the energy drink market and threw $550 million dollars for an 8.5% share of Celsius in 2022. Monster has already struggled to maintain market share versus Red Bull, which owns the largest portion of the energy drink market.. Now on top of this already stiff competition they have to deal with a whale like PepsiCo flooding the market with products like Rockstar and Celsius over time Reason 3: regulation- As more health focused initiatives take place in Europe and America, products like monster will face increased scrutiny, both from consumers and governments alike (regulations on certain contents). Reason 4: Even those who hit their goals have been getting smashed… AMD and Reddit- Now I get what you are thinking “what the heck do these companies have to do with monster”… and yea they have no direct relationship.. But even after surpassing their goals for this last quarter these companies have seen their value get smashed.. The market is being mad weird and bearish right now when it comes to earnings. So in essence this combined with reason 1 (the high goals they already have), means that I feel that the odds favor the Put/bear side Hope you enjoyed my presentation!! Wish you guys luck!!",0.5569,NEGATIVE,0.9999
"Why I think Intel is a Misunderstood, Undervalued Play – A Bet on 18A (+EV DD).csv","Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.",0.5307,NEGATIVE,0.9997
Why Intel is the most undervalued tech stock right now.csv,"Intel ($INTC) is an insane bargain right now, as it is trading at year 1999 stock price. Every other comparable tech stock is up 5000%-20000% since then. People are too focused on Intel consumer and data center products, which by the way are improving at impressive rate. Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3). Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD & NVIDIA offerings. But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment. Currently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons. Microsoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in. If you are a big tech company and want the best, cutting edge silicon you will have to switch to Intel foundry sooner or later.

"YoY 56%, YTD 356% - Living at home changed my life.csv","TL;DR - Dad got cancer - so I went ham on investing I've been a long time lurker of this sub (and I never really post on reddit in general), but I didn't know where else to post this. I don't do options so maybe this is the wrong place lmao. I moved back home to my parents place when my dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Truthfully this has been the worst year of my life (and his obviously) in a lot of ways, but I've been investing since I was 16 (I'm 25 now). My dad worked in equities, so when he lost his ability to communicate effectively with me (and since I had significantly more income because I'm not paying rent) - I truthfully went ballistic on investing. Pretty much said fuck it, I'm living at home I don't need a 6 month emergency fund till I move out and went all-in. Granted 40% of my portfolio not listed here is in a 401k account entirely in the S&P 500 (set & forget just in case my equities went to hell as with the rest of my life lol). I believe in the margin of safety when investing. I like to invest in high-quality companies that generate lots of cash as the backbone of my portfolio. Since 2021 (before my dad got this cancer shit), I spoke with him and he basically said just look at the fundamentals of a company and invest in growth companies that you think will be around in 5-10 years. I look for value within growth stocks (i know paradoxical). Some of my icons in investing are David Tepper & Michael Burry. Again below is all my own experience and reflects only my own views and are not a recommendation of my company (corporate. disclaimer). My portfolio is heavily weighted (85%) between several stocks: AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL (So fucking cheap r u kidding me sorry), NVDA, AMZN, AMD, CRM, COST, RIVN (RIP), AVGO, VOO (ik not a stock) <-- I know semi(s) are very cyclical but i believe in holding all of these companies for 5-10 years, so I don't have to worry about temp. earnings beats/misses etc. Much easier to pick a stock and hold it for a while then it is to get the timing right. Roughly at 175% return in the past 3 years. (hammered META at $100's, NVDA at $200 both in 2022) Roughly 15% of my bets are moonshots (note the word bet hehe) with promise but objectively could be overvalued/bad investments: CCL/RCL (both are crushing it and between them own 75% of the cruise line market), LCID/RIVN (going to 0 bc they can't scale profitably or will make u a very happy person 3 years down the line bc R2/Atlas at 45k/50k should capture a significant portion of model y demand), TTD, DKNG/FLUT - gambling hasn't even been legalized in Cali/Texas (the biggest markets in the U.S. come on), RBLX (feels like betting against youtube in the early innings w/o realizing how much rev. they're actually recognizing), PYPL (value - cheap af (bought at $60) should turn around in a couple years) I joke I allocate like google's budget where it's 90% bread&butter and the rest are moonshots. Was very depressed (still reasonably depressed) because I'm not sure how much time my dad has. I hope in a way I can pass some of these stocks to my kid in a better place than I found it.

AI chipmaker Cerebras files for IPO to take on Nvidia - But 87% of its revenues have come from the U.csv,"The Middle East wants chips badly but US restrictions prevent the US most powerful chips entering into certain geographical areas such as China and the Middle East; this entails the UAE. Nevertheless, the UAE wants in on the GPU chips craze and is apparently willing to pay anything to enter into the chip bonanza. The UAE can't get Nvidia's, AMD's, or Intel's best GPU chips so instead they are investing heavily into alternatives such as Cerebras. There is nothing inherently wrong with this but it's also the biggest red flag as an investment opportunity. If the agreements for Nvidia chips open up in the Middle East and specifically with the UAE that could be a crushing blow to this aspiring startup. Specifically, Cerebras Systems reported a net loss of $66.6 million for the first six months of 2024, on $136.4 million in revenue. For the same period in 2023 it has a net loss of $77.8 million on just $8.7 million in sales. 87% of this revenue for the first half of 2024 was directly from the UAE G42. The other red flag from this startup is the way in which they promote their business. It's all seemingly smoke and mirrors and conveniently based on outdated GPU pricing and throughput information; which is very publically available. For some reason, Groq and Cerebras love to keep using memory to unlock speeds on small/tiny models which is impractical and inefficient for a scaled system; or a system that is a large foundational LLM. As well, they have no clue what models will do next so it's a major after the fact architecture that uses llama because they have access to it. https://cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebras-inference-ai-at-instant-speed. A prime example of this is OpenAI's GPT-o1 model that uses reasoning in coordination with its model capabilities. Because they are not being used on the forefront of this technology they don't know how or when a model's size, function, or needs will evolve into the future. All of this plus the pricing from OpenAI and Microsoft is coming down exponentially. For Example: They are referring to a 70b param model that shoves an entire model onto memory. They are going up against h100's which is a very old technology at this point. They make no reference to h200's let alone blackwell Because they are referencing such a small model the pricing model they suggest would be radically different for a 400b param model and forget about trillion param models which are coming next. They're not being truthful about tokens per s. As of today this is Azure GPT 4o and GPT 4 mini tokens per minute gpt-4o & GPT-4 Turbo global standard Model Tier Quota Limit in tokens per minute (TPM) Requests per minute gpt-4o Enterprise agreement 30 M 180 K gpt-4o-mini Enterprise agreement 50 M 300 As you can clearly see 30 million tokens per minute is 500k tokens per second and mini is 833,333 tokens per second. So i don't know why they are referring to 20 tokens per second or their 450 tokens per second seems way off. maybe they mean million. Even if that is the case and 70 b would be more like mini it is way higher than their limit. On pricing which they lay out a 3:1 input versus output is fine the price would be for mini which is a comparable model is roughly .10 cents (input) + .20 cents = .30 cents. Per million. for regular 4o it would be higher and let's face it GPT 4o is a far superior model than llama 3.1 3.33 dollar + 5 = $8.33 Source: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/ From this information what I can tell you is that what we just went over is pricing. it is not some guarantee for what a model produces per second. That shit is very random. What I can tell you is from GPT 4 to GPT 4 turbo to Gpt 4o the speed is dramatically better. GPT 4o mini is damn near real time. Take that for what it's worth. I am not saying they're being dishonest here but I am saying they are being very cheeky with how they advertise things. The company is currently being primarily supported by the UAE, with investments worth roughly $900 million for new AI supercomputers known as the Condor Galaxy series. Any growth here is singular to this source of investment and not driven by organic growth or usage. This is not a competitor to Nvidia but rather a temporary solution in the Middle East until chip embargoes are alleviated. The media here loves to use sexy headlines on non-technical verifications of what it is they are actually comparing. I.e. H100's are now old, or The fact an entity may need to serve millions of clients... No they are instead reporting self-prompting headlines from Cerebras that say things like our chips are 20x faster than Nvidia. Live Update: As I am writing and researching this topic it has just been reported by Reuters that the U.S. is setting a new rule to allow chip shipments to the Middle East including the UAE which is a boon to Nvidia and Microsoft. US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East Here are couple excerpts: WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), to data centers in the Middle East. G42, a UAE-based AI company with historic ties to China, has been a focus of those concerns. In April, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), opens new tab announced that it would invest $1.5 billion in the company, with plans to provide G42 with chips and model weights, sophisticated data that improves an AI model's ability to emulate human reasoning.The deal drew scrutiny from China hardliners in Congress, even though G42 said in February that it had divested from China and was accepting constraints imposed on it by the United States to work with American companies. LOL you can't make this up. Literally this just got reported by Reuters today 9/30/2024. This completely aligns with my argument above regarding the UAE-G42. With chips now entering into the Middle East from Nvidia and potentially others I don't know how this startup IPO makes it off the ground. I don't mean to be bearish but I don't think this is the time for them to raise an IPO without showing more progress. I could be wrong. As of now, I don't plan on buying any shares. Instead, I will be adding more shares into Nvidia because now this is bullish news for Nvidia.",0.5441,NEGATIVE,1.0

AMD CEO Lisa Su Says AI Is In Early Stages Of Multiyear 'Supercycle' 'There's Tremendous Need For Mo.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) shares are experiencing an upward trend after the company reported strong second-quarter financial results. Following the announcement, CEO Lisa Su emphasized that the chipmaker’s performance is being driven by a multiyear AI “supercycle.” What To Know: Recently, chip stocks saw a sell-off as earnings season approached, with investors questioning the timeline for significant returns on the massive investments in AI. This led to speculation that spending on AI might slow down. However, early earnings reports indicate that capital expenditures have remained robust. Su’s comments on CNBC’s “Squawk On The Street” Wednesday provide reassurance against slowdown concerns. She stated, “From the conversations that I have with our customer set and sort of the broader industry, we can see that AI is a multiyear, you know, I would call it a supercycle frankly. There’s tremendous need for more compute.” AMD reported second-quarter revenue of $5.835 billion and adjusted earnings of 69 cents per share, surpassing analyst estimates as its AI business continues to see accelerating demand. The chipmaker also updated its forecast, expecting GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion this year, up from the previous forecast of more than $4 billion. Su highlighted that analysts and investors are “hypersensitive” to minor quarter-over-quarter changes. She believes that the AI story should be viewed in a broader context, suggesting that the demand is extraordinarily high. “I wouldn’t be hypersensitive in those areas ... Are more customers using it? Is every enterprise asking for it? Are we seeing more applications on a daily, weekly, monthly basis? The answer to that is absolutely yes,” she said. “Everywhere I go, everyone wants to talk about how can we incorporate AI into our businesses faster and more efficiently ... this early in the cycle, there’s a lot of learning and experimentation, but definitely, there will be the return on the investment on the other side,” Su added. Although the return on investment isn’t “instantaneous,” it’s occurring very quickly. AI is already boosting productivity and enabling companies to bring better products to market faster. Su emphasized, “We’re investing today for the return in a couple of years, and I think that’s absolutely the right thing to do. That’s the way to think about these investment cycles.” AMD’s strategic focus on AI and its strong financial performance underscore its robust position in the rapidly evolving technology landscape, highlighting the company’s potential for sustained growth in the coming years.",0.5537,NEGATIVE,0.8673

"AMD Q3 Preview EPS Jumps 30% YoY, Close Gap with Nvidia.csv","AMD will release its Q3 earnings report on October 29th, after the U.S. markets close. Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year. This report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure. With Nvidia's earnings report on the horizon, AMD's results offer a useful benchmark. Although AMD has significantly underperformed Nvidia year-to-date, this could be an opportunity to turn the tables. Data Center Growth is Key Analysts predict AMD's data center revenue will reach a record $3.52 billion for Q3. In July, CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in strong revenue growth for the year's second half, driven by demand for Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. Earlier this month, AMD launched its latest data center AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, and investors are keen to see its performance. Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari pointed to sustained growth in AI infrastructure capital expenditure, a recovery in server CPUs, and AMD's ongoing market share gains. AMD's x86 server CPU market share rose to 34% by Q2 2024 from less than 20% in early 2022, and Goldman Sachs expects AMD's next-generation server CPUs could further extend its edge over Intel Corp.",0.6043,POSITIVE,0.9866

"Apple reportedly seeks to lock out its competitors from TSMC's 2nm process, by booking all of its ma.csv","Apple has long been cozy with TSMC, the manufacturer of the chips that end up in ever-popular iPhone, iPad and Mac products. When you've got as much cash on hand as Apple does, it puts it in a favorable position to negotiate deals with the Taiwan-based chipmaker. Now it is reportedly seeking to lock in 100% of TSMC's bleeding edge 2nm production capacity, giving it a competitive advantage when products eventually make their way to the market. According to 9to5mac (via Extreme tech), Apple's chief operating officer met with TSMC bosses to negotiate terms to secure 2nm capacity. The report cites 'local sources', so there needs to be a pinch of salt here, but given Apple's track record of locking up TSMC's capacity, this would certainly come as no surprise. TSMC's 2nm process is currently scheduled to enter risk production in 2025, with volume production set for the second half of 2025. That means the upcoming iPhone 16 family with A18 chips will stick with 3nm, but it could mean the high end iPhone 17 Pro and Max could be the first in line to be built with 2nm technology. The specifics of deals between TSMC and its customers are obviously not made public, but it is widely accepted that Apple booked all of TSMC's 3nm capacity, at least for a period of time. These chips, including the A17 and M3 families made their way into the latest generation iPhone 15 Pros and MacBooks. That would make Apple's 2nm play unsurprising. It's easy to see why Apple would attempt to secure the maximum amount of 2nm capacity. It will give it an advantage over its competitors, as 2nm chips will allow Apple to pack in more transistors into a given area, leading to better performance or lower power consumption—if not both. Samsung has its own manufacturing capacity, and future Exynos chips will be built in-house, but 2nm Snapdragon and possibly Google Tensor chips may have to wait in line behind Apple. Even mega-companies such as Google and Qualcomm don't have the cash on hand to outbid big daddy Apple. It's not just Arm competitors that will be disadvantaged. Nvidia will want every possible power and performance advantage it can get as it dominates the market for AI processors, while AMD will also have to wait for access to the best nodes. Even Intel could find itself at a disadvantage given some of the tiles for its chips are manufactured by TSMC.

Bloomberg Again Reports on Semiconductors With Flimsy Information on Secret Government Contacts.csv,"Usually, when things that are leaked with an intention the entity where the leak comes from is pleased with said leak. Not for Bloomberg though. Bloomberg actually accomplishes citing an anonymous source about on ongoing discussions related to chip distribution and subsequently takes that information to the White House National Security Council to ask them to comment. Here is the WHNSC's response. Bloomberg: US Weighs Capping Exports of AI Chips From Nvidia and AMD to Some Countries A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the talks but pointed to a recent joint statement by the US and UAE on artificial intelligence. In it, the two countries acknowledged the “tremendous potential of AI for good,” as well as the “challenges and risks of this emerging technology and the vital importance of safeguards.” The council responds with a no comment while directing them to a positive statement. To me, this greatly diminishes whomever the Bloomberg contact is. This is the second time that Bloomberg goes out of their way citing a leaky government source that on it's own merits isn't really that sensational at all. The headline is sensational the reality is not. The approach would set a ceiling on export licenses for certain countries in the interest of national security, according to the people, who described the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Officials are focused on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing appetite for AI data centers and the deep pockets to fund them, the people said. This isn't even news. Reuters reported on this a month ago with a much more neutral to positive tone. Which it is. Reuters: US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia to data centers in the Middle East.Since October 2023, U.S. exporters have been required to obtain licenses before shipping advanced chips to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.Under the new rule, data centers will be able to apply for Validated End User status that will allow them to receive chips under a general authorization, rather than requiring their U.S. suppliers to obtain individual licenses to ship to them. If you're tracking, this simply seems to be the 2nd half of that original conversation. There are already chip restrictions. Nvidia is already not delivering the most advanced chips to those countries. The framework proposed would allow Nvidia to deliver chips under certain restrictions and guidelines. Bloomberg acknowledges this towards the tail end of the article. While officials have debated the best approach, they’ve slowed high-volume AI chip license approvals to the Middle East and elsewhere. But there are signs things could get moving soon: Under the new rules for shipments to data centers, US officials will vet and preapprove specific customers based on security commitments from both the companies and their national governments, paving the way for easier licensing down the road. What I don't understand is why does Bloomberg like to make things salacious when they're seemingly not. There is 0 chips to parts of the Middle-East today, but the U.S. government is working on a framework that may relieve that. Reuter story from a month ago. The end.

Could PLTR go on a TSLA-like Run (70%) if Included in SP500.csv,"On June 7th, S&P 500 is set to rebalance and Palantir will be eligible for the third time. With the spotlight on AI and Palantir's continued strong performance, there's a very high likelihood it is included in the S&P, which could lead PLTR going on a Tesla-like run. First, let me break down why Palantir is a great candidate for inclusion. Inclusion in the S&P 500 index involves meeting several stringent criteria related to market capitalization, liquidity, financial viability, and corporate governance. For Palantir Technologies (PLTR) to be considered a good candidate for S&P 500 inclusion, it must satisfy these key requirements: Market Capitalization: A company must have a market cap of at least $14.6 billion (as of 2023). Palantir's market capitalization has been above this threshold for a while. Liquidity: Companies need to have adequate liquidity, with a high trading volume. Palantir's shares are actively traded, reflecting strong investor interest and sufficient liquidity. Financial Viability: The company must report positive earnings in the most recent quarter and over the last four quarters combined. Palantir has demonstrated profitability, reporting positive GAAP EPS in recent quarters (InvestorPlace). U.S. Based: Companies must be U.S.-based, with the majority of their assets and revenues derived from the U.S. Palantir fits this criterion, being headquartered in Denver, Colorado, and deriving significant revenue from U.S. operations. Public Float: At least 50% of a company's shares must be in the public float. Palantir's public float percentage is adequate to meet this requirement, with substantial institutional ownership indicating wide distribution among public shareholders Palantir meets all the eligibility criteria, the only which could be a problem is corporate governance, ie, the insiders own a lot of shares of the company; however there are tons of examples of other companies that have a similar structure. As many of you know, Tesla went on a 70% in the weeks leading up to and the month following its inclusion. However, it's not alone. Many other ""sexy/high-profile"" names go on epic runs when SP500 inclusion is announced. Twitter (TWTR) Inclusion Date: June 7, 2018 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $26 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on May 21, 2018, Twitter's stock increased by approximately 14%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, Twitter's stock increased by about 5%. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2019 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2019, NXP's stock rose by approximately 10%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, NXP's stock increased by around 6%. AMD (Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.) (AMD) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2017 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $20 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2017, AMD's stock increased by approximately 12%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, AMD's stock rose by around 9%. T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS) Inclusion Date: June 22, 2020 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on June 5, 2020, T-Mobile's stock increased by approximately 8%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, T-Mobile's stock saw an increase of about 7%. NVIDIA (NVDA) Inclusion Date: November 18, 2001 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $25 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: NVIDIA's stock saw a significant rise, roughly around 20-25%, in the weeks leading up to the inclusion. Month Following Inclusion: The stock continued to perform well, with an additional increase of around 10-15%. ""S&P 500 effect,"" is a real phenomenon and I think it's even more powerful with high-profile names like Palantir. As mentioned earlier, Tesla went on a god-like run in the weeks leading up to and after the announcement. And I think Palantir shares many characteristics with Tesla that may see it go on a similar run. Both companies have a very high-profile CEO. Alex Karp is loved by Palantir holders just like Elon is by Tesla fanboys, which leads to my most important point: retail ownership. Palantir has a significant amount of its shares outstanding owned by retail; if SP500 inclusion is announced and institutions have to buy shares it may create a similar move like Tesla's as most palantir fanboys won't sell. Like Tesla, they believe Palantir is changing the world (look at their subreddit). I think buying Palantir options is a great upside play with limited downside, depending on when you purchase your options. The inclusion announcement is on Friday after hours, so you could buy Friday before close or anytime this week and sell Monday morning if its not included for a minimum loss. And with options being so cheap, this could be a 50-bagger if it goes to 30 bucks. 6/21 23 C 6/21 25 C.",0.5557,POSITIVE,0.7174

See this article: https://www.wired.com/story/book-excerpt-science-of-ultra-pure-silicon/ The company, Unimin (parent company - Sibelco) has it's main production facility in Spruce Pine, North Carolina. Rumors indicate that the town has been wiped off the face of the Earth. https://x.com/FossilLocator/status/1840218595541778791 Production has been hauled for the foreseeable future. There are some alternative methods to produce this material, but people are saying that this accounts for over 90% of the world's supply and this material is critical. The backup company in the US is The Quartz Company, which is also located in Spruce Pine, and is probably also gone too. I am trying to figure out who would be screwed the most from this. I'm sure it's a gamble, but some of the big semiconductor companies are going to be railed with no more supply of their fine powder. Thoughts on who to short? I'm thinking NVDA, TSM, AVGO, AMD, TXN, QCOM. Any other ideas? Edit: I'm looking at google maps and crossing with this image from twitter https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GYmBnGVWAAAjGsy?format=jpg&name=small That location is about 767m above sea level. Coordinates: 35°54'58""N 82°04'13""W. Flood looks like a meter or two. So lets say that everything below 768m flooded at some point in the last few days. Sibelco has their mine at 35°53'52""N 82°03'40""W, which is like 800m above sea level, so that's probably fine minus road damage from falling trees. Quartz Co has an operation on the river 35°55'37""N 82°05'36""W with a ton of equipment (presumably railroad shipping) that sits below 765m. Safe to say that area has been underwater. But their scale is smaller than Sibelco, so I don't think it would matter much",0.54,POSITIVE,0.9939

How Terrifying is the Start of August.csv,"Just over the past three trading days, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 indices have all recorded their largest three-day cumulative decline since June 2022! Last night, the Nasdaq plummeted by over 6% at one point, and the S&P 500 dropped by more than 4%, with both indices returning to their early May levels by the close of trading. Although the major U.S. indices and individual stocks still closed with significant losses, the intraday declines were somewhat moderated. The primary reason for this was the release of the U.S. July ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, which rebounded from a four-year low in June to 51.4, exceeding market expectations and returning to the expansion zone above 50! Sub-indices, including the New Orders Index and Employment Index, also showed growth. Notably, the Employment Index reached 51.1, marking the largest increase since September of last year and the first time this year that it has entered the expansion zone above 50. This data slightly alleviated fears from last week's significant non-farm payroll decline, making the market believe that the drop in new jobs was primarily due to Hurricane Barry hitting Texas. 👉 As discussed previously, the sharp decline in U.S. stocks at the start of August stemmed from worries about the U.S. economy falling into recession. Therefore, when the ISM Non-Manufacturing number showed growth yesterday, it somewhat restored market confidence in the economy, helping to narrow the intraday losses of U.S. stocks. The U.S. stock market now needs to see positive economic growth news to recover, unlike before when everyone was hoping for bad news, anticipating a Federal Reserve interest rate cut! Hence, it is crucial to continue monitoring other economic data. If strong and robust growth numbers do not consistently appear, investors will remain concerned about an economic recession, and the trend of selling stocks for cash will not end. The VIX Fear Index is a crucial indicator to observe market sentiment calming down. It surged above 55 in early trading, a level not seen since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020!",0.5444,NEGATIVE,0.9913

I’m sitting there like a fing genius looking at my hood gambling account, staring at the SMCI chart and reading all this bullshit regards are spewing on twitter about the stock getting delisted. Luckly, I just came out of a similar trade on B.Riley and kinda figured if those frauds can get away with not filing financials on time for over 180 days and they are still trading, there is no way SMCI will get delisted. I buy 250 $34.5 strike weekly calls on SMCI at $0.50 a pop. That’s a ~$12,500, baby position babbyyy. Why $34.5 calls? idk whats funnier than $34? $34.5. Also I looked at where it dropped when EY announced they wouldn't proceed as their auditors amd $34.5 is about the level they closed at that day. Finally, $34.5 is within my personal risk tolerance. guh Today, I’m minding my own business, scrolling Reddit, eating a sandwich, watching Ana De Armas AI Porn, minding my own business. My phone buzzes, and it’s my buddy. This guy texts me out of nowhere, “Man, I think I’m fucked. I sold $34.5 naked calls on SMCI this week.

I wait all year for this opportunity - now I'm going to share it with you.csv,"If you trade long enough, you begin to see patterns emerge. On October 30th, one of my favorite patterns is starting. If you buy AMD stock on the last Monday of October, the average return for the rest of the year is 24.52%, and the stock is higher 88.89% of the time. This data starts in 2015 because it is the first full year after Dr. Lisa Su became CEO of AMD. Some of you may be wondering why this period is so strong for AMD stock. Let me share my personal theory. AMD depends on TSMC for chip manufacturing. Taiwan is protected by its geography and weather, but the Chinese have two windows of opportunity to cross the Strait with favorable weather. The first is from late March to the end of April. The second is from late September to late October. Last year, China launched major military exercises around Taiwan in April. This year, they did it in October, which just ended a few days ago. (They also launch these exercises when they are provoked, such as when Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan or during the recent Taiwanese elections.) In my view, the end of October triggers a relief rally in stocks related to TSMC, most notably AMD and Nvidia. This combines with earnings and strong seasonality, resulting in massive outperformance in a relatively short period of time. A quick word of warning—this time period includes earnings. If you want to avoid earnings risk, you can wait until the first Monday of November. If you wait until November, the average return is 19.06%, and the stock is higher 77.78% of the time by the end of the year. Here is a quick comparison I do all this shit manually so I apologize if there is an error in one of my calculations. My positions: Long 1000 shares with a cost basis of $157.90. Although I am considering switching to a risk reversal. I would use a risk reversal selling the Jan. 2025 $155 puts collecting 12.70 then using that to buy twice as many Jan. 2025 $180 calls for $6.50 (I would buy x2 as many calls to make the net cost ~.30)",0.5754,NEGATIVE,0.8872

In INTC I trust.csv,"I've shifted my entire S&P 500 holdings into Intel, and here's why: The AI Revolution: NVIDIA currently dominates the AI technology landscape, and that’s indisputable. Their unmatched tech and visionary leadership have set the bar high. However, with the U.S. aiming to maintain its global leadership, relying on a single company for AI tech could become a security risk and a bottleneck in innovation. Why Intel Could Be the Game-Changer? Intel (INTC) is uniquely positioned to disrupt NVIDIA's monopoly. Alongside AMD, Intel possesses the expertise and resources needed to engineer AI chips. Enter Gaudi 3. If Gaudi 3 lives up to the hype, Intel’s stock could potentially skyrocket, doubling in value in a matter of months hands down. Government Backing: The U.S. government and major institutions are already showing their support for Intel, recognizing its strategic importance in the tech race. Positive Vibes: Reviews for Intel's Arrow Lake architecture are rolling in with strong positives, indicating that Intel's on the right track to regain dominance.

INTC - A dumb person's retrospective.csv,"I'm lazy and you regards don't like to read so I'll leave it to bullet points and you can piece them together. Intel was seen as a bargain in 2023 compared to NVDA and AMD after their 400% run up. US gov have vested interest in Intel. No they are not propping Intel up, but it's effectively giving Intel a big loan to buy a second house. That loan can pay off if the housing market goes up, or they are double fucked because they leveraged to buy a second house. If you bought Intel because china will invade Taiwan, you are really regarded. If China invades Taiwan, everything is going to sell. That's a disruption of global trade on WW2 levels. Your best case scenario still loses you money. Intel bullish scenario is 18A, High-Na EUV paying dividends, early experience granting them a year technological lead over TSMC. It doesn't have to work, but the upside is a 10x from these levels. TSMC pass up High NA EUV is repeating the same decision Intel did in 2012 when Intel controlled the market and did not view EUV as economically feasible. Again, doesn't mean TSMC is incorrect in their assessment, but history does repeat itself. Intel bearish scenario is just repeat of 2016 and delay after delay. In which case they head to legacy company status like Ford. Anyone else remember all the Ford bulls in 2016? They're not on this sub anymore because they all went broke. I'm no crayon guy. But everyone can see that $30 was a magic line, and drastically going below it to $21 is a market signal that the company is now viewed fundamentally differently. Yes it can go lower, especially the general market trends change we see this week. AMD spent from 2008 to 2016 an absolute garbage penny stock. You WSBers nowadays don't even know how ridiculed you were for even considering AMD. 2015 to 2017 were peak AMD years on this sub when regards jumped the gun, bought calls because MUH mindfactory data and muh 1% min benchmarks losing them everything over and over again. You kids don't even know struggle. Struggle is putting your 1k paycheck on AMD calls every week thinking this week you will hit.

The investment only somewhat paid off in 2018 when AMD traded to 30, but then half the regards lost everything (myself included) when it crashed to 18 in 2 months following Powell's rate hike. Look how quickly sentiment changed for AMD from 2018. This very well could be history repeating itself, as the semiconductor companies have demonstrated over and over again. Intel 18A is a repeat situation of AMD ZEN. The upside cannot be understated. I'm still bullish. Proper execution can bring the company to a $200+ stock. I bought and sold Intel throughout the year. 8000 shares from 35 to 50, sold at 43, bought at 35, sold at 30 before earnings. I was up 130k, lost 100k of it. Bought 2500 shares at 21.30.

INTC and AMD.csv,"Thesis: AMD ($AMD) and Intel ($INTC) are Undervalued Stocks In the dynamic and highly competitive semiconductor industry, AMD ($AMD) and Intel ($INTC) have demonstrated remarkable resilience, innovation, and market presence. Despite their solid fundamentals, both companies appear undervalued when considering their current market prices relative to their intrinsic value, future growth potential, and industry positioning. This thesis will explore the reasons behind this undervaluation, focusing on financial performance, strategic initiatives, market trends, and competitive advantages. Financial Performance and Valuation Metrics Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratios: Both AMD and Intel have P/E ratios that are below the industry average, suggesting that the market has not fully recognized their earnings potential. AMD's forward P/E ratio is around 25, while Intel's is approximately 12, compared to the semiconductor industry average of 30-35. Revenue and Earnings Growth: AMD has exhibited robust revenue growth, driven by its strong product portfolio and increasing market share in both consumer and data center segments. The company's revenue grew by over 20% year-over-year in the last few quarters. Intel, despite facing competitive pressures, has maintained stable revenue streams, with significant contributions from its data center and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Cash Flow and Profitability: Both companies generate substantial cash flows, supporting their ability to invest in R&D and return value to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. AMD's free cash flow margin stands at around 10%, while Intel's is approximately 20%. Strategic Initiatives and Technological Advancements Product Innovation: AMD's Ryzen and EPYC processors have gained significant traction, challenging Intel's dominance in the CPU market. The company's advancements in 7nm and 5nm process technologies have positioned it as a formidable competitor in both consumer and enterprise markets. Intel has made strides in expanding its product lineup, with significant investments in AI, machine learning, and autonomous driving technologies. The introduction of its Alder Lake processors and advancements in 10nm and future 7nm nodes signal a robust product roadmap. Strategic Acquisitions: AMD's acquisition of Xilinx is expected to enhance its capabilities in adaptive computing and bolster its presence in key growth markets such as 5G, automotive, and aerospace. Intel's acquisition of Mobileye and investments in autonomous vehicle technology underscore its commitment to diversifying its revenue streams and capitalizing on emerging tech trends. Market Trends and Competitive Landscape Demand for Semiconductors: The global semiconductor market is projected to grow significantly, driven by increasing demand for high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, and IoT applications. Both AMD and Intel are well-positioned to capitalize on these trends. Competitive Positioning: AMD's competitive pricing and performance advantages have enabled it to gain market share from Intel, particularly in the desktop and server CPU markets. Intel's extensive ecosystem and strong brand equity continue to make it a preferred choice for many enterprise customers. Underappreciated Catalysts Supply Chain Resilience: Both companies have demonstrated resilience in navigating the global semiconductor supply chain challenges. AMD's partnerships with TSMC and Intel's plans to build new fabs in the US and Europe are strategic moves to mitigate supply risks and ensure capacity for future growth. Expansion into New Markets: AMD's foray into gaming consoles with partnerships with Sony and Microsoft, as well as Intel's advancements in the data center, networking, and edge computing, present substantial growth opportunities that are not fully reflected in their current valuations. Conclusion In conclusion, AMD and Intel are undervalued stocks, with market prices that do not fully reflect their intrinsic value, robust financial performance, strategic initiatives, and potential for growth in the rapidly evolving semiconductor industry. Investors should consider the compelling investment case for both companies, driven by their innovation, competitive positioning, and resilience in the face of industry challenges. As the global demand for semiconductors continues to rise, AMD and Intel are well-equipped to deliver sustained value, making them attractive opportunities for long-term investment.",0.5699,POSITIVE,0.9975

Intel - Pinnacle of failure.csv,"Intel's Slippery Slope: Financial Woes, Investor Distrust, and Leadership Issues Intel Corporation, once a dominant force in the tech industry, is now grappling with a series of significant challenges that have fueled a troubling decline. Despite attempts to project a positive outlook, the company’s current trajectory suggests a troubling downward spiral. Financial Performance and Market Challenges Intel's financial performance has continued to deteriorate. For the first half of 2024, Intel reported revenues of $24 billion, marking a slight decrease compared to previous periods. This decline is occurring amid a broader tech sector recovery and highlights Intel’s struggle to maintain its competitive edge. The company's net income for this period was a mere $800 million, translating to a profit margin of approximately 3.3%, indicating substantial operational inefficiencies and intense competition from rivals such as AMD and NVIDIA. Declining Customer Satisfaction and Product Concerns Customer dissatisfaction remains a critical issue. The release of Intel's 14th Gen Core processors has not addressed the performance inconsistencies that plagued previous models. While the company has introduced new features, reviews suggest that these updates have not significantly improved reliability or performance compared to competitors. This ongoing issue is eroding customer trust and impacting market share. Eroding Investor Confidence Investor confidence in Intel is faltering. The recent involvement of Apollo Global Management has raised concerns, particularly following Apollo’s controversial investment decisions in other sectors. Additionally, a recent lawsuit filed by major institutional investors alleges mismanagement and failure to deliver on key performance promises. This legal battle has further shaken confidence, prompting several large investors to divest from Intel, exacerbating the company's financial strain. Leadership and Legal Troubles Intel's leadership is facing intense scrutiny. Recent high-profile exits, including the departure of several senior executives, have led to a perception of instability at the top. The company's reliance on legal strategies to address its challenges, rather than focusing on operational and strategic improvements, appears to be aggravatinh its difficulties. This reactive approach is not addressing the underlying issues affecting Intel’s performance. Future Prospects and Potential Downturn Intel’s future prospects remain uncertain. Despite a significant $15 billion R&D budget, the company’s progress in key areas like AI and autonomous driving lags behind that of its more agile competitors. Moreover, while short-term production issues in Taiwan have provided some temporary relief, these are unlikely to reverse the long-term downward trend. The competitive landscape continues to evolve rapidly, and Intel’s slower adaptation could hinder its recovery prospects. TL;DR Intel’s current strategy, which includes overhauling its product lineup and executive team, appears to be a desperate attempt to stabilize its position. For investors and stakeholders, the warning signs are clear: Intel’s challenges are substantial, and the company’s efforts to turn things around may not be sufficient in the face of ongoing and evolving issues.

Intel is a good buy.csv,"We are all well aware Intel is having it's own Boeing moment right now with design flaws in their CPUs and horrible customer service. They deserve the steaming pile dooky that is currently sitting atop their share value. That being said, they have an ace that may flip the entire market on it's head: They own their fabs. That's right: all the other big boys in town design and give their blueprints for TSMC to manufacture. That's true of AMD, Nvidia, and other ARM and mobile chip designers. Intel is the only large scale chip designers that is more or less vertically integrated. As you may know, they just got $8.8B from papa Biden to build more foundries in Ohio and Arizona, in addition to their other sites across the world. None of this is particularly noteworthy until you consider that China has always been very interested in Chinesing Taiwan, and are even more so now that they have been embargoed from Nvidia chips by the US. The Chinese military build-up over the past decade has focused heavily on amphibious warfare, and long range anti-naval weapons (think carrier buster ballistic/boost-glide stand off weapons.) It doesn't take a Ph.D in geopolitics to understand what the move is here. On the US/allied side, the discourse around Taiwan has slowly shifted: what started out as ""we have overwhelming force and we will stop any attempt at an invasion of Taiwan"" has become something like ""Maybe we can't stop them from invading, but we can make it a Pyrrhic victory"". This may actually be the case, but the trend is not great. You will have noticed Taiwan has been increasingly politically isolated, mirroring the growing Chinese military power in the region. So what happens to TSMC if Taiwan gets Chinesed? As you can imagine, China is interested in acquiring as many TSMC assets and personnel intact as possible. This means you can bet your degenerate bacon that US intelligence services have contingencies to extradite key scientists and engineers, and scuttle the production plants and machines before the Chinese can take control of them. But the result is easy to predict: no more TSMC. This means the personnel extradited will be used to advise and run US production plants owned by, you guessed it: Intel. Intel will have a quasi monopoly on chip manufacturing. The US government see this of course, that's why they are strongly nudging Nvidia to play nice with Intel, because they see a potential future where Intel is the only player in town capable of making Nvidia chips, or any consumer chips at all for that matter, in the West.

Intel is a pretty safe bet and are undervalued.csv,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs. An additional benefit is that Intel can leverage their fabs in order to achieve higher margins for their own products. It's possible Intel's stock could be hit again in a month or so when their report comes out, but they are likely already at bottom.",0.5493,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Is INTC undervalued .csv,"Valuation Analysis of Intel Corporation Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has long been a key player in the semiconductor industry, but recent market developments and the rise of competitors like AMD and Nvidia have caused its stock to significantly underperform relative to its peers. As of Q2 2024, Intel’s total assets amount to approximately $182 billion, with liabilities around $91 billion, resulting in a net asset value of $91 billion. Yet, its market capitalization is around $95 billion, reflecting an almost 1:1 ratio between market cap and net assets. In contrast, competitors such as AMD and Nvidia trade at significantly higher premiums, indicating that the market may be underpricing Intel’s growth potential. Company Market Cap (Billion $) Net Assets (Billion $) Price to Net Asset Ratio Intel 95 91 1.04 AMD 266 56.5 4.71 Nvidia 3,000 58.15 51.58 Understanding Intel’s Valuation The Price to Net Asset Ratio (P/NAV) is a critical measure of how the market values a company relative to its net assets. Intel's current P/NAV of 1.04 reveals that its market value is nearly identical to its net assets, a valuation that appears surprisingly low, particularly when compared to its competitors. AMD and Nvidia, for instance, demonstrate P/NAV ratios of 4.71 and 51.58, respectively. This significant gap highlights the possibility that Intel is undervalued, especially given its strong fundamentals and growth potential. Several factors support this assessment. Despite facing fierce competition, Intel remains a leader in the semiconductor industry, known for its quality and innovation. The company is making substantial investments in new technologies and manufacturing capabilities, positioning itself to capitalize on growing trends such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, Intel boasts a robust balance sheet, with total assets of about $182 billion and liabilities around $91 billion. This financial strength provides a solid foundation for future growth and strategic initiatives. Although the recent decision to lay off 15,000 employees might seem concerning, it is part of a broader strategy to enhance operational efficiency and focus on core competencies, enabling Intel to adapt more effectively to evolving market demands. A key factor influencing Intel's future is the increasing global demand for semiconductors. As technology becomes more integrated into daily life, the need for high-performance chips continues to rise. Intel's resources and commitment to innovation position it to capture a larger share of this expanding market. Moreover, government support for the semiconductor industry adds another layer of potential upside for Intel. Given the strategic importance of semiconductor manufacturing in light of global supply chain challenges, particularly concerning the Taiwan-China situation, there is growing interest from government entities to bolster domestic semiconductor production. This focus on strengthening local supply chains can create favorable conditions for Intel, as it could receive both financial incentives and regulatory support to expand its operations and enhance its competitive positioning. Conclusion In summary, Intel Corporation is significantly undervalued based on its current P/NAV ratio. The company possesses strong assets, a history of innovation, and a strategic focus on future technologies. As Intel continues to execute its strategic plans and navigate market challenges, it has substantial potential to regain its competitive edge and achieve remarkable growth. Furthermore, the increasing government interest in supporting semiconductor manufacturing amid geopolitical uncertainties enhances Intel's prospects. The market's current valuation does not adequately reflect Intel's true value and growth potential, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

Long-time AMD Holder (Cost Basis 1904) Starting to Sell - Anyone Else Disappointed in the Stock in 2.csv,"Wrote about my thinking below... Out of the 31 large banks, 25 have a “buy” rating and 6 have a “hold” rating on AMD 0.29%↑. It’s hard to think about why to sell when everyone is telling you to buy, but I am of the opinion that is when it should be most deeply considered. image credit to tipranks.com AMD has been my most profitable investment of the past 5 years, having risen 800% since purchased in August of 2018. For most investors (including myself), it’s difficult to part with winners. Not only that, I am someone who believes AI will proliferate throughout society in the coming years. Because they design data center GPUs, AMD should be one of the primary beneficiaries as the AI boom continues. It might seem counter-intuitive then to sell the stock here, but that is what I’ve begun doing over the past two weeks. I had high hopes for AMD this year, but it’s my view that they've failed to take significant data center GPU market share from Nvidia, and will have increased competition from Intel's new product offerings (on both client and data center), as well as proprietary silicon from large cloud players (Google, Amazon, etc). My original thesis was that AMD would profit from overextended Nvidia margins in 2024, but this underestimated the CUDA ecosystem moat that existed with Nvidia data center products (see Why I Got Nvidia Wrong). While most large cloud players want to diversify at least somewhat from Nvidia, they are still unable to do so without risking a competitive advantage with their own AI offerings. Add Intel into the mix, and the margin and market share pressure will be on AMD. The only player in the silicon value chain I think which can currently raise margins is TSMC (TSM 2.61%↑), but the geopolitical risk is too high for me to continue holding the stock (I sold my TSMC stake two weeks ago). On the PC (personal computer), Nvidia has always had a strong moat. It’s not just because they have the best performing products, but also because game developers are economically incentivized to optimize first (and often only) for the largest potential audience. This is similar to the moat CUDA protects on the data center side. One might think that Nvidia charging incredibly high prices for discrete graphics cards would cause them to lose share to AMD with consumers who directly purchase the products (as opposed to businesses who purchase the data center products). Yet Nvidia market share has only grown over the past few years. Data from Jon Peddie Research Why This Take Could Be Wrong: There is a lot of bullish momentum in the investor community around AMD currently from both professional commentators and retail investors (e.g. Twitter / X). Many people who had never heard of AMD 5 years ago are now saying to put money into the stock as it is Nvidia’s only pure AI competitor. As a result of this, AMD could see a dramatic rise on a positive earnings report later this month. In addition, I expect gaming revenues to surprise to the upside with the minor refresh of Xbox and Playstation consoles coming for holiday season. I still have ~260 shares of AMD remaining, and will likely hold to see if the stock jumps on the report. I think that AMD is extremely stretched in its current valuation (P/E of 205), and that any bad news could send it spiralling. Selling half of the remaining stake now is essentially a hedge against this possibility. Whatever happens with the earnings report, I will likely reduce my AMD holdings to zero in the next few months as I continue to lower exposure to companies reliant on Taiwan.",0.5591,NEGATIVE,0.9976

Wells Fargo ($WFC) must face a lawsuit over sham job interviews Rate Cut Countdown — Will the Fed Finally Pull the Trigger? Nope, the Fed isn’t cutting rates this week. But don’t snooze just yet—this meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn’t overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy—he's searching for that ""just right"" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same. Inflation: Cooling Off Inflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year’s 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the ""last mile"" of inflation reduction. The message? We’re on the right track, folks. Unemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it’s taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell’s recent take? The labor market isn’t adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a “sweet spot”—balancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals. Risk Management Reboot With inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed’s risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle—slightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed’s past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they’re determined to act promptly to avoid a recession. Some Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it’s time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn’t seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first. The Fed’s balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31. McDonald’s: The Golden Arches Stumble By the Numbers Revenue: $6.49 billion (missed $6.61 billion estimate) Earnings per Share: $2.97 (missed $3.07 estimate) Same-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020) U.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7% International Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1% International Franchised Sales: Down 1.3% McDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening. Value Meals to the Rescue The fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn’t translated into higher overall sales just yet. Internationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk. Defying the Odds Announcing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away. Despite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a ""buy"" and none recommending a sell. Looking Forward The golden arches are taking a ""forensic approach"" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales. So, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future.

Microsoft’s Cloud Rain on Earnings Parade In a classic case of “so close, yet so far,” Microsoft ($MSFT) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, only to see its stock plummet over 5.79% in after-hours trading. Why? Investors fixated on the company’s disappointing Azure cloud revenue. Earnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints Microsoft’s revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure’s performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue—just shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub’s impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn’t enough to quell investor concerns. By the Numbers Revenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected Market Reaction and Future Outlook While the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft’s other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure’s growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn’t enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft’s shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500’s 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market’s laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters.

Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter AI Chips and Data Center Dominance The tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company’s overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast. Other Segments and Market Reaction While the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD’s business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year AMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high. On The Horizon Tomorrow’s labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let’s be honest, they’re all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week’s job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes. Before Market Open Boeing ($BA): Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels. Expected: $3.51 EPS, $6.85 billion in revenue. Marriott International ($MAR) : The hospitality giant thrived post-pandemic with revenge spending, but the travel boom is slowing. Investors are eager to hear how Marriott plans to attract more budget-conscious travelers. Expected: $2.47 EPS, $6.48 billion in revenue. After Market Close Meta Platforms ($META): Next up in the Mag 7 parade, Meta’s spending spree on AI, including the new Llama 3.1 model, is under the microscope. The focus will be on how these investments impact cash flow and margins. Expected: $4.72 EPS, $38.30 billion in revenue. Arm Holdings ($ARM): With a staggering 94% rise in 2024, Arm’s valuation is in question. Shareholders are keen to see continued strong demand for semiconductors without sacrificing margins. Expected: $0.34 EPS, $903.57 million in revenue.",0.5605,NEGATIVE,0.9997
MU earnings beat estimates but still plunges 7% off-market hours.csv,"MU beats estimates (earnings per share exceed by 24%, revenues by 110M, +17% sequentially), but the stock plunged by 7%. It will most certainly drag a few other semiconductors stock in its downfall, especially AMD. Now my question : was the stock overpriced (experienced a +70% share price within 6 months) and is now corrected to its accurate value during the off-market. Or could it be a good entry point, expecting the retail investors to make the stock rebounds against the traders' new valuation, as it happened to a few tech stock already?",0.5974,NEGATIVE,1.0
My Analysis on ARM Holdings 2 Trillion+ Valuation.csv,"I believe ARM Holdings is slept on! I believe it could be the next NVIDIA. As of this writing its Market Cap is sitting at $142.36 Billion. I believe that its market cap should be ATLEAST 1 trillion due to the fact that it has an enormous market share of damn near if not more of 95% of the worlds smart device chips. What makes ARM unique is its business model. Their primary source of revenue is from the leasing of the design of the instruction set of computer chips. For those who dont know the instruction set is often referred to as an instruction set architecture (ISA), is a group of commands for a CPU in machine language. These commands tell the processor what operations to perform. Each instruction in the set specifies a particular operation to be performed on a specified set of data operands. The instruction set is fundamental to the design and functionality of computer chips, dictating how software communicates with hardware... So what is unique about this? Well I will tell you, these instruction sets are incredibly energy effecient compared to what is used currently for AI such as RISC or X86 etc. Currently NVIDIA is soaring because of the AI craze and its success has put light onto AMD, INTEL, SMCI etc but I believe ARM is a sleeper in my opinion. Their main source on revenue is through the royalties it recieves for leasing its designs. They can easily raise the royalty rate to increase their revenue stream anytime but there are some downsides. There customers could leave them and use other options. I dont think that is going to happen because lets face it their intellectual property is far better than any of the competition in terms of effeciency. AI is growing rapidly and one key expense is going to be energy consumption. Especially in these data centers. To my knowledge most data centers run on chips that use x86 from Intel. Those chips using that instruction set uses alot of energy. I believe data centers are looking to convert to a more energy effecient chip and when they do.... ENTER: ARM. Arm is currently used in almost all smart devices because again they are energy effecient. Why do we have longer battery life in a smart phones? Its because of ARM. What chips do electric cars use? ARM what instruction set does your microwave, fridge, washing machine use? ARM. Currently ARM is all over the portable device market but once they hit the data centers I believe there revenue is going to explode and therefore the market cap. There are major catalysts going down right now such as Microsoft partnering with them to make ARM based laptops and NVIDIA collaborating with them to make computers, not to mention that Tesla ordered a ton of NVIDIA chips that use ARM architecture. But my most bullish thing about ARM is what Jensen Huang said at Computex. He said that AI will eventually become physical in terms of robotics. Do you think those robotics need a energy sucker of a computerchip instruction set? No, the need the most energy effecient tech in todays age and that where ARM steps up right again. Currently we only use AI remotely (Chat GPT, Picture Generators, Etc.) but once we put AI into something physical and tangible such as robots to do everyday tasks those devices and robots need to run on the most advance and effecient software. I am currently looking at an outlook of 5-15 years and I am long on my position is this stock. We all seen what nvidia did and can only imagine what the next stock can yield the same returns and I think its ARM Holdings. Imagine going back to 2017 and investing into NVIDIA when the markect cap was the same as ARM now. Those returns look nice right if you have invested then. The time is now. Please keep in mind that i have not decided to go completely in depth of all of my research on ARM Holdings so please do your own. Also, I purposefully did not go into fundementals such as earnings and revenue on this. This is just my personal long term outlook on the research I have done. There are plenty more catalysts and risks out there so please DYOR. Feel free to comment!",0.5404,POSITIVE,0.9991

My outlook on markets going forward - from a dear regard.csv,"January 2024: market starts to price in anticipated 4-5 rate cuts in 2024. Tech moons. Small/Mid caps stagnant. for the first quarter you could make bank - i made 30k through march and withdrew that shit to pay for my kids school. April 2024: I am now a reformed bear continuing bull strategy from the first 6 weeks: S*P drop 5.4% through April 19 - higher than expected inflation date. Push rates higher, lower # of anticipated rate cuts. I got hammered trying the same call strategy. Gave away 15k if not more. May 2024: AI AI AI every time you say AI in your earnings call the price goes up $1. S&P up 5.96% June 2024: News Report: tech doesn't even need a rate cut to continue the bull run. June 12 $AAPL says ""APPLE INTELLIGENCE"", reaches all time highs. (puts for their earnings btw). $NVDA 140% for the year? After last year we were like WTF how is this 300 a share let alone 1400 a share in June. July 2024 $GOOG $AMZN up ~80-100% for the year. Look, its logical to take profits. No shame in that especially for retail who loses out 90% of the time. July 2024: Rate cuts like 99.999% almost certain for sept. Now suddenly Small/Mid caps rally in a massive sector rotation. $SPX/$NDX tanks. Next week: 1T outflows. Then they pump and dump the russel up 12% to 2022 highs and then sell off for a quick 6% while everyones FOMOing into $RUT. Maybe more like RUT RO!!!! I Fomo'd last of dry powder MOnday but after earnings I'm turning bearish. Tomorrow 5k realized loss for me or hold to 0. Too hard to beat the street. Profit taking, buying million dollar real estate with cash like smart investors do. Sit on the sidelines and let it bleed. But here we are still FOMO'ing calls and short dated puts that would only print 1/1000 times. Over the past few days 3 mag 7 earnings all tanked and here we are. AMD? CPUs Good for gamers and graphics cards for poors. Pennies compared to $NVDA. $NVDA has a monopoly on AI software like $ASML has a monopoly on lithography and $TSM has a monopoly on chip production. $TSLA obviously seemingly doomed. Google can't take your cookies anymore, advertising revenue down MoM. Wanna get cucked by the zuck? I'm tempted to donate $1 to people wanting to buy $META calls at this point. TLDR: This looks like the same pattern we have had in 2022 and 2023 when markets take a downturn through mid-late October. Look at the previous years. I posted last week about the last 4 septembers being red. It looks like we are in another downturn. Earnings indicates it. I don't think CPI and PCE will save us this week. I'm scrounging up 25k waiting for the correction / dip / crash and buying SHARES so i never waste so much of my lifetime just to lose money speculating with options. Will post my realized losses if you think I'm BS. Thanks for reading this or just the TLDR. Looking forward to discussion!",0.5416,NEGATIVE,0.9998

Tesla preaching and evangelizing the PE did him an apostate. He's done. TESLA CRUSHED HIM. Tesla easily slid into it's PE and Chanos is no more.

Just like Zuckerberg sucker punched Open AI LLM's by making it's LLM open source and scorching the Earth, So goes NVDA: Open sourcing their DATA CENTER TECH, ( a little secret, its not just about the GPU, it's the entire package, it's not just about BLACKWELL GPU. But Rack/ Data Center Tech Design and Architecture, there will BE ZERO INCENTIVE FOR CUSTOMERS TO GO TO COMPETITORS WHEN RACK ARCHITECTURE THAT FITS BLACKWELL GPU's with ZERO ISSUE, IS COMPLETELY OUT IN THE OPEN: READ SUMMARY( this is why AMD and INTEL are having such a hard time competing and frankly anybody else, unless you're DELL and WORKING with Jensen...

( Jensen is busy busy busy ) ""At this year’s OCP Global Summit, NVIDIA will be sharing key portions of the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system’s electro-mechanical design with the OCP community — including the rack architecture, compute and switch tray mechanicals, liquid-cooling and thermal environment specifications, and NVIDIA NVLink™ cable cartridge volumetrics—to support higher compute density and networking bandwidth."" ..""said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “By advancing open standards, we’re helping organizations worldwide take advantage of the full potential of accelerated computing and create the AI factories of the future.” https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-contributes-blackwell-platform-design-to-open-hardware-ecosystem-accelerating-ai-infrastructure-innovation Everybody KNOWS there is a plateau. A plateau and lower business revenues based on estimates that TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT INFERENCE IS LESS DEMANDING THAN TRAINING. THAT BEING SAID, MARKET IS NO LONGER LOOKING FOR INSANE NUCLEAR GROWTH. BUT STEADY HEALTHY GROWTH. THAT** WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. Crazy AI nuclear growth, is not what the market is expecting. Market is expecting a healthy stable growth, now that we are near equilibrium with AI and chips, ( this is obviously not true, but it's the arguments bears try to hang on. They think Amazon will overtake a 30 year CUDA industry software environment the entire world/industry has created THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AROUND). Go look up CUDA. It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four... NVDA continues to climb on growth, steady healthy growth, not insane nuclear growth. THAT WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. It has no where else to go. Ive's and Wedbush, are ENTIRELY correct. Dan Ives and Josh Brown Discuss NVDA https://youtu.be/u-95RKiEl5o?si=8Cpbr3LFWE9WsVju Lastly NVDA will own the entire vertical from Hyperscaler to Retail Individual end user level, why? NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming Latest Sept 2025, with my guess, Jensen starts marketing from first half of 2025, and wider release commercially of NVDA CPU for 1st qtr of 2026, March, me thinks Jensen starts getting market ready all of 2025 for release in the wild September 2025 for retail user and full wider release by March 2026 / end of February 2026. Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?.. I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about. And as far as I know, Biden or Trump won't block sales of regular computer pc windows chips to China or anywhere else for that matter. :) Imagine being the king of accelerated compute and now you have a cpu + gpu combo ARM chip that runs silent like Apple M chips and sips low power like such, but games and does AI and any heavy compute intense task very wicked like, very retail level computer chip level like that is specifically from the box ready to work with cuda and marry with existing nvidia gpu's at the hyperscaler level to even more efficiently run AI intense software and on prem (on the laptop or pc itself without cloud compute help, like QCOM snapdragon Elite PC boasts it can do(but sucks, incompatible with lots of software and games, not so with nvda).

NVDA has been all the rage and justifiably so.csv,"Since NVDA reporter its Q1 2023 earnings, revealing huge demand for AI chips, the stock has surged to $3.3T. Revenues 4x, margins up expanded and everything seemed perfect. Bulls claimed the stock was getting cheaper to decelerating growth. Quarterly revenue growth has dropped from 88% to 34% to 18%, heading towards single digits. Next quarter we’ll see just 7%. All of the marginal buyers are in — sucking the last few retail buyers in with the lure of a split. History suggests short term bump after a split as we are seeing, but now institutional investors have a vast pool to distribute their shares in coming months. As the saying goes, “when the ducks are quacking, feed them.” If the quarterly revenue growth continues to moderate, earnings growth will be impacted as well — making the stock become more and more “expensive” (multiple screams higher) versus the theme of last year when the higher it climbed the “cheaper” it got. This does not change the fact that it is a great business with a great leader — which will play a role in the advance of AI technologies and productivity. It’s just going to be a heavy lift that it retains a perception of greater value than Amazon, Microsoft or the entire German Stock Market Capitalizations (where it trades now). NVDA is still a semiconductor company, which has never been a secular business — it’s cyclical. Always has been, always will be.

We also added the Gaudi 3 PC IE card to it, this use case of Xeon plus an accelerator or Gaudi accelerator is getting very good response from customers as well. So we'll be bringing that out later this year. But the real story is delivering the TCO value, delivering the enterprise use cases.

"NVDA will hit 5T market cap in 2026, and 10T market cap before 2032.csv","Hi regards, This is not a ""copium"" post about the recent stock price drops. I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest. The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY. First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"". Name Stock price EPS SP/EPS ratio AAPL 230 1,4 164 MSFT 413 2,95 140 AMD 145 0,16 1.035 META 516 5,16 100 AMZN 171 1,26 135 NVDA 116 0,68 170 As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price. But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list. AAPL Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits. How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new. But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more. MSFT They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are. They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy. They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office? AMD I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first. Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware. Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software. And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section. META They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value. ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS. AMZN The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL. NVDA AND OUR STAR CHILD. HOT TOPIC OF 2024. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company. Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?

Nvidia is down 17% from its peak. Its hard to call the bottom, but yesterday we saw a major flash crash followed by a v back up. Much like the opposite of the ""blow-off"" tops that we see when the bull runs peak. Big volume selling, big volume buying. Big down, big up. I expect the fast bears used that to get out.

NVIDIA (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang Points to 1 Trillion Opportunity for the Company.csv,"Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the next few weeks until the US election would be “confusing” for many since no one could say anything with conviction about who is going to be in the White House. Lee said that the market is going to trade “well” into the upcoming Fed meeting where he expects “some” rate cuts amid the labor market needing support and positive inflation data. Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said: However, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive. For this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that a trillion dollars’ worth of general-purpose data centers will inevitably transition to accelerated computing. “We’re in a computer revolution,” Huang said, pointing out that the first wave of data center modernization is driven by generative AI, which he described as more than just a tool—it’s a skill. Huang also emphasized the need for “densification,” with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) aiming to make data centers more efficient by compressing them into smaller spaces. He discussed NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it. Nvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia. Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave. At Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range. Of course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.

Nvidia The only problem you're gonna have is that you didn't sell more.csv,"Introduction Alright, so Nvidia is crazy overvalued right now. Just check out its P/E ratio – it's sitting at a whopping 73.94. And that's not all. Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.55, and the price-to-sales ratio is over 42. These numbers are way above what you typically see for tech stocks and the semiconductor industry. There are two big reasons why Nvidia's stock might take a hit: growing competition and lowered margins. Growing Competition First off, the competition is heating up big time. 🔥 AMD's MI300 series is a beast, merging CPU and GPU on the same chip, which is great for performance and energy efficiency. This is super important for data centers and AI applications, and it could seriously cut into Nvidia's market share. AMD is coming in hot, and Nvidia might end up feeling the burn. Then you've got Intel with their Gaudi3 GPU, which is packing some serious performance and efficiency for AI and machine learning tasks. More people might start switching to Intel's GPUs, giving Nvidia a run for its money. Intel's Gaudi3 could be the ghost in Nvidia's machine👻 Lowered Margins Then there's Amazon, which is throwing its hat into the ring with custom GPUs for their EC2 instances. These GPUs are optimized for machine learning and AI, and they integrate perfectly with Amazon's cloud services. This seamless integration could mean less reliance on Nvidia's products, pushing Nvidia to cut prices to stay competitive. Lower prices mean lower margins, which isn't great for Nvidia's bottom line. Amazon could very well turn Nvidia's margins into margin call memes. 📉 Adding to the heat, TSMC is thinking about jacking up production fees for Nvidia. The chairman's plans to raise prices could eat away at Nvidia's margins even more. If TSMC hikes those fees, Nvidia might have to dig deeper into their pockets, and that could be a real pain in the margins. 💸 Link (06/04) So yeah, Nvidia's stock might be flying high right now, but with all this competition and pressure on margins, it might not stay that way for long. It's looking like Nvidia might be headed from tendies to tears if they can't keep up. 😂 TL;DR Nvidia is trading high, but AMD, Intel, and Amazon are bringing the heat. 🔥 Competition + TSMC price hikes = potential margin squeeze. Stock might go from 🚀 to 💥 if they don't keep up. 😂",0.5456,NEGATIVE,0.9812
Nvidia's Blackwell Delay Offers Investors A Chance To 'Add To Positions' says Goldman Sachs.csv,"Nvidia Corp (NVDA) finds itself at the center of tech speculation as reports have surfaced about potential delays in its much-anticipated Blackwell architecture. With tech giants like Nvidia often facing the heat of public and market scrutiny, the slightest hiccup can stir investor unease. But is this delay really a cause for concern, or just a blip on Nvidia’s otherwise smooth journey towards AI supremacy? According to a report by The Information, Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell chips might hit a speed bump, delaying their release by over three months due to alleged design flaws. These chips were set to ship later this year, boasting promises of up to 30x better Inference performance over their predecessors. Despite this setback, Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs advises investors to remain calm and continue with their current strategies. The delay, while not ideal, is unlikely to impact Nvidia's 2025 earnings power or its market dominance, according to Hari. “We expect there to be little to no impact on CY2025 earnings and, most importantly, the company's long-term competitive position.” Hari believes that any short-term volatility in Nvidia's fundamentals will be just that—short-lived. The Market Reaction: Opportunity or Overreaction? For those ready to jump ship, Hari's advice is clear: stay the course. Nvidia's stock might experience some turbulence, but the company’s strong footing in the AI market isn't going anywhere. “We would consider any near-term dislocation in the stock as an opportunity to add to positions.” Despite a recent 15% correction, Nvidia remains a top pick, firmly seated on Goldman's Americas Conviction List with a 12-month price target of $135, suggesting a potential upside of nearly 26%. Even with Blackwell’s reported delays, Nvidia’s projected 39% year-over-year growth in 2025 remains unchanged. Hari’s bullish stance is rooted in Nvidia’s role as a crucial player in the rapidly evolving AI sector, especially as the demand for advanced AI infrastructure shows no signs of slowing down. Implications for Rival – AMD Interestingly, while the Blackwell delays might appear as a dark cloud over Nvidia, there could be a silver lining for competitors like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (AMD). “We believe the market could perceive this development as a marginal positive for AMD — the only alternative to Nvidia today in Data Center GPUs.” Although the analysts say AMD is unlikely to overtake Nvidia due to Nvidia’s strong market position and AMD’s challenges in scaling operations, this situation could still present a competitive boost for AMD. What’s Next for Nvidia? In the tech world, where speed and innovation reign supreme, a three-month delay might seem significant. However, Nvidia’s legacy of innovation and market leadership paints a different picture. As Hari points out, “any impact to CY2025 earnings will be negligible,” and the temporary setback should not deter investors from seeing Nvidia’s long-term value. For now, Nvidia’s strategy remains rock solid. The potential delay, whether factual or exaggerated, is but a temporary hurdle, according to Hari. As Nvidia navigates this challenge, the market watches closely, with many investors seeing a buying opportunity amid the noise. For those invested in Nvidia's future, Hari’s message is clear: hold steady, as the AI revolution waits for no one.",0.5505,NEGATIVE,0.9994
NVIDIA's share price surge and the outlook for the AI arithmetic market bubble risk and rational lay.csv,"As NVIDIA's share price has risen sharply in the short term, many have begun to wonder if the industry is facing a turning point or if there is a bubble. From the perspective of the industry giants, GPUs, as representatives of A1 arithmetic chips, are currently far from meeting demand. We can assume that AI applications are still only in their infancy, and there has not yet been a particularly prominent Al burst application in the world. Analyse the results: The AI market is still at an early stage: AI applications, despite explosive growth in recent years, are still at an early stage. The arithmetic power required for current AI applications (e.g., big language modelling, autonomous driving, robotics, etc.), especially GPUs, is still in the pre-burst stage. The growth of Tesla and the robotics industry, for example, predicts that billions of robots will be needed in the future for arithmetic support. This means that there is a huge potential for growth in AI arithmetic demand over the next few years, especially in inferential computing. GPUs as core hardware for AI: GPUs play a key role in AI inference computing, especially in tasks that require high parallel processing power (e.g., deep learning inference, autonomous driving, robot control, etc.). Although there are already many GPU products on the market, overall, the demand for AI computing power is still in a state of oversupply, and the size of the AI computing power market is likely to continue to expand, especially in the ‘reasoning’ segment of the demand for this segment is the area of high computation, especially in the field of automated driving, cloud computing and so on. Personal view: NVIDIA's leadership in the GPU space is well recognised, but many are beginning to worry about an industry bubble due to the short-term surge in its share price. NVIDIA's dominant position: Currently, NVIDIA is the almost unrivalled leader in the field of AI hardware (especially GPUs), and its products are widely used in AI training and reasoning calculations, especially playing a central role in large-scale data centres and cloud services. NVIDIA's rising share price reflects investors' optimistic expectations about the potential of the AI market. Bubble Risk: As NVIDIA's share price has surged, the market has become sceptical about whether it is overvalued. NVIDIA's high valuation could lead to the formation of a bubble, especially if its products and technologies are not sufficiently digested by the market. While the AI industry is promising, the market is volatile in the short term and the rise of competitors (e.g. AMD) could change the market landscape. Therefore, investors and industry observers need to be wary of market overheating and short-term speculation. Core view: US tech giants (e.g. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook) are supportive of NVIDIA's technology, but they will also support NVIDIA's competitors, such as AMD, in order to avoid the arithmetic market being monopolised by one company and to ensure the sustainable development of the industry. Analyse the results: Rational rather than short-term profit-driven: the behaviour of these tech giants suggests that they are not simply pursuing short-term profit when purchasing AI arithmetic, but are planning the security and sustainability of their own development in the long term. By supporting competitors such as AMD, these companies avoid the risk of the market becoming too dependent on NVIDIA alone, ensuring diversity in market competition and technological innovation. This kind of rational decision-making is crucial to the healthy development of the AI hardware market. If NVIDIA dominates the AI arithmetic market without competitive pressure, it could lead to overpricing, affecting the interests of other tech giants. As a result, companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon prefer to ensure diversity and healthy competition in the AI arithmetic market by supporting competitors such as AMD. In summary: future outlook and risks Huge potential for AI arithmetic: The demand for AI arithmetic is far from reaching its ceiling, especially in the area of inferential computing, and the market demand for GPUs will continue to grow as robotics and autonomous driving technologies evolve. The adoption of AI technologies will generate even more demand for arithmetic power in the coming decades, especially in emerging technologies such as robotics and autonomous driving. NVIDIA's dominance and risks: While NVIDIA's dominance in the AI hardware space cannot be ignored, the sharp rise in its share price and high market valuation have raised concerns about the existence of a bubble. Future technological competition, especially the rise of competitors such as AMD, may affect NVIDIA's market share. Long-term layout of industry giants: U.S. tech giants are very rational when investing in AI arithmetic, they will not simply pursue short-term benefits, but pay more attention to the diversity of the arithmetic market and the sustainability of the technology, to ensure that they can be invincible in the competition in the coming years. The AI arithmetic market is full of great potential, but is still in the early stages of development. While NVIDIA occupies a leading position in the AI hardware market, its high valuation and share price volatility also make the risk of a bubble",0.5575,POSITIVE,0.7135
NVIDIA’s next catalyst has to be sovereign AI.csv,"NVIDIA’s current valuation is not overtly expensive (FPER: 33, PEG: 1.61 according to FINVIZ) and the GPU orders for next year are all booked. Yet the stock is meeting strong resistance around $130. I think this is partially because a lot of people have been burned by CISCO during dot-com bubble and do not want to price in the future too much. But the real concern is that their revenue is almost entirely dependent on the rest of M7 and they are charging the big tech 80 % margin. The big tech, while being hammered by Wall Street for the increased CAPEX spending, indicated during last earning that they will not reduce their investment on AI. However, they did mention that they are/plan using their NPU (Google TPU, Tesla Dojo, AMD) to reduce the usage of NVIDIA GPU. Furthermore, GPT5 and Apple Intelligence should be available to the public by the end of this year. If these do not impress, the entire AI sector may see significant slowdown. But if GPT5 shows plateauing of performance while people find Apple Intelligence interesting, paradigm could shift toward smaller models and inference efficiency, again reducing the demand for NVIDIA. To justify significant increase in NVIDIA’s stock price, they need to show that they are not entirely dependent on the Big Tech. The only other potential buyers that have as much buying power are governments. Also, if the economy is going through downturns, governments have excuse to increase their spending. What I am paying attention to during the earning call is demonstration from NVIDIA that they are receiving significant demand from non-Big Tech such as governments.",0.5529,NEGATIVE,0.9994

Short Call Strategy Am I Regarded or Might This Actually Work.csv,"Okay, so I'm guessing a good amount of us in this subreddit were new to options trading at some point in time, and when we were just itty bitty option noobs first hearing about them, we just thought: "" Wow! this is just the same thing as betting on stocks but with leverage right?"" (might just be me when I first got into options trading but whatever). Moving on. I assume that many people's first instinct was to go and buy a call on a stock they were very bullish on. And I would assume that once we did that, we lost the entire position because we never knew how theta decay, IV, DTE, strike price, and other factors could sink your entire position. The thing about these factors is that when you buy a call, the majority of these factors are stacked against you, and if you don't want them to be completely stacked against you, you gotta pay up for a higher premium which is gonna yield the same or less of a return then the lower priced (but considerably more risky) options. You're paying for less risk. Long Calls are usually only profitable when the underlying has a significant enough uptick to outweigh all the other factors dragging down the value of the option. I'm sorry I don't mean to repeat the basics of valuing options but I think it's important to pretext them a little bit so my strategy makes more sense in the grand scheme of things. Okay, so my strategy is as follows: why buy a call, and have all of these factors stacked against you, when you can sell one, and have them work in your favor; I guess the whole basis is: the shittier the call, the better (meaning how likely it is to expire or be exercised with no value). The even better thing is we can magnify the shittiness to work in our favor on the sell side by selling balls deep out of the money calls, with low IV, and few DTE. And we can magnify this even further by selling calls on options with really shitty stocks underlying; stocks that are down 40% YTD, or just really, really stagnant not moving anywhere (might also get some sexy low IV to work in your favor there too). I don't really have any stocks in mind right now to lock this trade in off the top of my head, but $NOC and $AMD are quite down this last month and a half, and are relatively popular stocks. Like I said I need to find some better stocks for this Strat; these are not the ones I wanna go with, just what I thought of off the top of my head Now you might be saying two things: 1. ""The prices on them are probably gonna be pennies on the dollar. Sure the odds might be in your favor, but the yield is gonna be very low"", and 2. ""What fucking moron is gonna be stupid enough to buy these calls?"". To answer question 1: Why not just sell more calls? And to answer question 2: I don't think I need to illustrate the stupidity of individuals in the market, but if you need me to, here you go: WSB regards (not dissing, I am also a WSB regard who has lost thousands on YOLOs), teenagers with a Robinhood account that just found out about options, and maybe even people who are legit investors, but have bought the call as a part of some bigger options play, like a straddle, or iron condor (not to mention that in the example of the straddle, I don't think they would really give a shit if the call tanked because, well, it's a straddle lol, the put on the other side would cover the losses and make profit{and yeah there are probably more plays where this is the case that I am just forgetting about, but this is the example I'm just gonna go with for now}). Not to mention markets are huge and I've checked the open interest on some of these calls and there are hundreds going up to the thousands in open interest on balls deep OTM, 2DTE, Low IV call options. Anyways, I guess the reason I made this post is to double check with some options veteran (I've been into options for a little less than a year, but I have some knowledge on them from my job) to see if this strategy is complete delusional manic retardation, or if there is actually some substance to it. I wanna make sure there isn't some variable or factor I'm not accounting for that could tank this entire play. If anyone could let me know, that would be much appreciated, thanks.",0.5298,NEGATIVE,0.9997

I had also stated that the stock is undervalued, however, even though the stock had skyrocketed 12.5% today, i still strongly believe that the stock is still undervalued at $875 as it hit $960 a month ago and $1229 around march. The company also had stated that they want to supply 1000 liquid cooling racks per month, and increase their 1% market share to 15% within the next 12 months. This means that the stock has a lot of room for growth and i firmly believe that it can reach a market cap of $75 billion after its next ER, which would make the share price at around $1300. I am currently holding 10 shares right now, which is down from my 20 shares from yesterday as i had sold at $880.

This meant that there is still a chance to buy SMCI while the shares are cheap right before they release their earnings in a month.

They also have a PE ratio that is lower than Nvidia and AMD at around 45, a foward PE of 21.79 and a PEG ratio of under 1.

Strong AI and Semiconductor weeks ahead.csv,"Hi all, I think that AI and esp. Semiconductor Stocks have a couple of strong weeks ahead. Starting on Tuesday, October 15th 2024, the Open Compute Project (OCP) global summit takes place in San Jose, California. Between 9 AM and 11:30 AM there'll be short keynotes (each 12 mins) presented by Meta, NVidia, AI Clusters, Intel, AMD, Microsoft and Google (full schedule here). Now, I don't think that there'll be any big surprises. But the Summit still presents an opportunity for public remarks about how strong the demand is or what so ever. Also, there's an article that says that Broadcom (AVGO) is going to show case cutting-edge AI infrastructure. Further it is expected that Taiwan Semiconductor Company (TSM) and ASML Holding (ASML) will publish their Q3 earnings next week. TSM will present its earnings on October 17th 2024 at 14:00 Taiwan time / 02:00 Eastern Time. So pre-market movements will most likely be wild on Thursday as a large part of the industry relies on TSM. If TSM reports a great Q3 revenue, this could push Nvidia over the current all time high. Also according to Moore's law is dead, the first RTX 5000 series GPUs are ready to be sold, but are not released because of business reasons (here at 22:22). So they could still change their mind and ship in Q4. Next, it is rumored (by moore's law is dead) that AMD will release a new CPU by the end of October or early November, the 9800X3D which is an 8 Core Gaming CPU with 3D cache and it is expected that it will be the fastest gaming CPU releasing this year. Although Client is not as important for AMD, it will still be beneficial to have this CPU released before the holiday season. Especially since Zen5 Rysen has so far been viewed as rather disappointing. Moore's law is dead also mentions an RX 7650 GRE GPU, which could launch alongside Ryzen 9800X3D. Releasing a slightly refreshed and cheap RDNA3 GPU could be a good move by AMD to get rid of RDNA3 stock ahead of the RDNA4 launch in 2025. Since the Ryzen 9800X3D has not yet been anounced, I don't think that it has been priced in and could give the stock a slight boost to recover from the -4% last Thursday. Also, I although Investors were not excited about AMDs Advancing AI event, I think AMDs position in the market is still solid. According to the slides shown at the event, AMD Epic has increased its market share to 34%. And according to tests AMD Epyc Turin obliterates Xeon 6 Granite Rapids, while being cheaper. Because of this, I think AMD is in a good position to gain more server market share. Further, the news about Nvidia Blackwell being sold out for the next 12 Months is not only good news for Nvidia but also for AMD. Sure, everyone wants blackwell. but if one can't get blackwell and if AMD Instinct MI325X is faster than Nvidia Hopper (H200), then they might be able to win over customers from nvidia, who would like to buy blackwell but can't in due time. Also, AMDs earnings should be reported on October 29 2024. Due to Ryzen Zen5 being disappointing and there being apparently a large RDNA3 stock remaining. If AMDs Instinct systems are selling well, this would also be good news for Micron Industries (MU), which produces high bandwith memory (HBM3e). And then there's Intel. Their newest releases seem to have been disappointing. But they claim to be making progress with their foundries.

They are frequently gamers, so they need to buy NVDA GPUs and AMD CPUs. They often buy these at AMZN. They buy YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, so they can skip the ads of their fellow influencers (GOOGL) They spent most of their waking hours at META's Instagram website. They drive a TSLA or RIVN. They're on the GLP-1 drug (LLY) to impress their SOs. They're churning their credit cards with AXP Platinum and Gold, JPM's Chase Sapphire Preffered (no, NOT Reserve), some younger ones need to rely on COF's Venture and Venture X cards that gave nice ""subs"". They use these cards frequently to eat out and earn those points at CMG, SHAK and SG. They're flying a lot on DAL, and they need their free wifi that is often sponsored by their preferred choice of mobile carrier, TMUS. To get to the airport they need to use UBER or LYFT, since they don't want to drive their sweet electric ride. When they arrive at their destination airport, they pick up their rental car, and of course they prefer AVIS (CAR), but their credit cards give them presential circle status on HTZ, so they are ok with that too. They check into their hotel room at Marriott (MAR) to impress their friends, but really they are using all their Chase points to book Hyatt (H) hotels. The slightly less premium young ones will have to go Hilton (HLT) and fly on UAL. They often booked all this travel on EXPE or BKNG. Sometimes they use ABNB. When they check in they need to get some food, so they use their DASH gift card they bought at COST every two weeks because they get 20% off. When they go to Vegas, they prefer to stay in WYNN, because it's where all the hot ones stay. After they're done with their holidaying which they do basically 4 months out of the year, they're going to ULTA or LULU to buy their beauty products or Khakis. They are drop shipping on SHOP and sometimes they need to use ZM to conduct ""business"" for their ""coaching classes"" that they teach. A lot of times they get paid using Venmo (PYPL).

"The next tech giant Why HOOD, PLTR and DKNG are the investment opportunities of a lifetime (Part 1).csv","I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong. $AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice. $NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were. And so in true wsb fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB. There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long. From a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about. And so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry : If you are under 40 years old, $HOOD (Finance), $PLTR (Defense) and $DKNG (gambling) will 100x during your investment horizon.

The short report for Intel (INTC) - A rabbit hole of CPU failures rate since 2022.csv,"Forenote: Im a technical person, A developer, this will be a technical DD to show how intel is failing to do their basic business model of manufacturing CPUs. Over the past month or so Intels customers have been becoming increasing irrate about CPUs just flat out dying after various finger pointing from Intel being debunked. I first caught wind of intels failures when a friends system started to become unstable, he would crash in games and sometimes doing mundane tasks. It all came to a clicking point when his systems files started becoming corrupted and he needed to attempt reinstalling windows. The attempts failed, windows couldnt even install without corrupted files, sometimes it would install and look fine, but running a verification shows that various system files were still corrupted but not important enough for the system to boot successfully. He would still get various crashes doing mundane things and gaming. It was basically a working brick at this point. So i got my research hat on, and discovered various reddit users on r/pcmasterrace were also reporting instability with their PCs. Not alot tho, this has been the wierd thing, Intel has such a large CPU failure rate, but not alot of reports which caught everyone by suprise. It started to make sense, the causes of the crashes were different for everything. Users were reporting issues with Nvidia, Issues with RAM, and issues with corrupted data. Obviously to any layman, these issues dont instantly point to an issue with the CPU. With GPU errors, Nvidia initially got heat, but Nvidia quickly debunked the issue reporting the GPUs that were returned were fully functional and had no issues. So I pulled out my handy dandy debug tools since my friend managed to get windows installed and it kinda runs. The first tests I ran were memory block verification. This validates that the memory is able to hold data immutably, after 4 hours the tests finished all green, the memory was stable and wasnt corrupting data. (its worth noting that the memory test software I used was very CPU lite so the CPU has little chance to corrupt the data its self, this is a stark difference to the Drive tests I ran.). Since my friend was getting corrupted files almost everytime he install anything, I ran the disk debug tools, these pull the S.M.A.R.T data from the drive and run various read and write tests. The S.M.A.R.T data came back green, the drive was reporting it had no errors or irregularies and was functioning fine, So i moved to the read and write tests, all red, the drive had a 90% file currption rate, I pulled the S.M.A.R.T data again, All green, the drive was still reporting it was functioning correctly. At this point, anyone would deduce they had a bad drive that was misbehaving, leading to the decreased number of CPU failure reports. After all, How can you say the CPU is bad when you have corrupt files? Many people forget how much the CPU is responsable for. When you read files or write files, its the CPU that tells the Drive what to store and where and what to read and where it is on the disk to read it from. and as i said, the software I used to test the drives is CPU intensive, it uses the the CPU to generate random data to store on the drive and hashes that data to verify it. So a bad CPU = Currupted data on the drive. Luckly my friend has 4 drives, So I told him to take out the ""bad"" drive and put in another one, I ran all my tests again and same result, the drive was reporting it was functional, but all the data was corrupted. The result was the same with all the drives tested. Now, this is a luxary many people dont have. Many people would get corrupted data on their drive and think the drive is dying and get a new one. However with 4 tests samples all failing the same way when days ago they were all fine is a very low chance. Now for the kicker, Intel has a tool to verify that the Intel CPU you have is a genuine Intel CPU, I guess intel has a problem of china making fake intel CPUs??? Ive never seen any but what the hell, its a useful tools since its does some basic CPU level checks. So i ran the verifier tool and its first test for a genuine CPU comes back green, Cool, it is a real Intel CPU. Memory test comes back green (We alreadt tested this soo good), next was the Graphics tests. Failed, the CPU was attempting to send data to the GPU and it corrupted the GPU memory. So now we have 2 symptoms. Disk data corruption GPU memory corruption My friend has Nvidia GPU and Nvidia previously debunked any issues with their GPUs. But we have a common cause, Intel CPUs are corrupting data when sending it to another device in the system (except RAM), Data sent to a disk gets corrupted and data sent to the GPU gets corrupted, which would explain the game crashes. Various other tests passed from boost speed changing, Wifi tests and math operations. After I finished all the tests and determed the issue is with the CPU, my friend RMA'd the CPU. This is where more troubles start. Intel refused the RMA, citing user damage, According to intel all the issues my friend was having was his fault and he caused the damage, After it was refused, I filed the RMA for him, to the same response, but because im a stickler I pushed for more info, Intel was refusing the RMA because of overclocking done by the motherboard. This is a previous blame game intel played, they were blaming Motherboards for putting in stock overclocks on CPUs causing them to fail, but this wasnt the case with my friend, his motherboard wasnt even stock overclocked, but intel refused it anyway. After this point is when the waterfall started coming down, a advanced tech-youtuber posted an exposé about intels CPU failures. See: Intel has a HUGE problem - Level1Tech the curtains were starting to fall, Apparently Game developers and datacenters (Intels BIGGEST customers) were getting large amounts of CPU failures specificly with intel CPUs. Now datacenters are normally quiet about this type of thing, opting to sort their issues directly with intel, but intel is turning away datacenters RMA's of thousands of CPUs, these datacenters has since publicly reported they are dropping intel systems from their products and only supporting AMD systems from now on. Intel has lost their largest customer base, because of their defective products and refusing to take responsability for the product inherit flaw. Intel is hoping this goes unnoticed, since reports are still low of CPUs failing because the errors are random and different each time and users dont know their CPU is defective, there isnt a big in your face ""The Intel CPU in this system has errored"" its always an error with something else, which is caused by the CPU. So intel is betting on customers blaming other manufactures like they did with Nvidia when this all started.

Edit: Ive received internal leaks from Intel employees explaining internal issues and intels failures. Source 1: The leading theory inside Intel right now, and it is just a theory, is that the Ring Bus is getting cooked because it's fed by the same rail as the P-Cores and E-Cores. Raptor Lake required incredibly high voltages that the clocks required to be competitive with Zen 4, and it seems like it was just pushed too hard. This is an inherent flaw that would be in Bartlett too it's overvolted. Meteor Lake isn't affected, and Emerald Rapids is unlikely be effected materially. Source 2: I never worked directly on Raptor Lake [Intel Design Engineer], but I did have exposure to Alder Lake, and I can confirm that they were very concerned about the ring bus getting damaged if the voltage was pushed too high. I can also confirm that Raptor Lake was rushed through the design and validation process... Source 3: I [Intel Foundry Services] can tell you that Raptor Lake was rushed through our Fab in Arizona in record time, but it's also produced in other fabs. However, this location (Arizona) is notable because I can confirm that there was an Oxidation issue caused by some failure in our HVAC system between March & June of 2023. It was so bad that Keyvan Esfarjani had to fly in to make decision about which wafers (which cost as much as a Model X each) needed to be thrown away. To be clear, I don't know what decision was made, but I do know that this event DID happen. And by the way, it affected Sapphire Rapids yields as well...although I doubt it's an issue that wasn't",0.5221,NEGATIVE,0.9929

Yes while the main points of the short report were not mentioned and intel continues to hide this infomation from Investors, they cant ignore the impact it has on their bottom line. RMA's are not cheap and the amount of money and time they are spending to fix the issue for existing chips while trying their hardest to deny RMAs for failed CPUs. Customers have lost faith in Intel, their chips are constantly beaten by AMD offerings and having a high failure rate really was the last nail in the coffin. Enterprise customers are switching, gamers are switching, datacetners are switching. All switching to AMD (or Arm - Yes Arm is starting to see some enterprise deployments, very little tho.) Intel will continue to have bad earnings for the forseable future (as they guided), And they also havnt announced (and likly wont) the delay of their next gen CPUs (15000 series) for desktop, they are expected to announce only Mobile chips and act like Desktop and server CPUs dont exist this generation.

VSH - The Forgotten King of Chips.csv,"TLDR: $VSH (Vishay Intertechnology) is printing money while everyone sleeps on it. $VSH just got the stamp of approval from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, confirming it as a hidden winner in Nvidia’s AI and RTX 50 supply chain. With key wins in MOSFETs, capacitors, and resistors, $VSH is now primed for explosive growth, riding Nvidia’s dominance in AI servers and GPUs. If you’re not jacked up on $VSH, you’re not meant to have money. Who is $VSH? Vishay Intertechnology is a veteran in the electronics industry. They make essential components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and semiconductors. You know, the boring stuff that makes your GPU, PS5, and electric toothbrush actually work. They’ve been doing this since 1962. That’s right, this company has survived every market downturn, bubble, and chip shortage in the last 60+ years. Meanwhile, you can’t even survive a red day on SPY. Why $VSH is printing money: Chips are everywhere—cars, phones, smart homes, AI servers. The global semiconductor market is growing at an insane pace (projected $1 trillion market by 2030). Guess what? Vishay is supplying the guts. Look at their P/E ratio: 12.5 (as of last check). Compare that to Nvidia’s 75+ or AMD’s 30-ish. $VSH is practically trading at the bargain bin, and yet their revenues are consistently strong. Vishay’s last earnings report crushed expectations, with double-digit growth in several segments. They’re sitting on $3.4B in annual revenue with plans to scale. Oh, and they’re buying back shares like they’re on clearance at Costco. Everyone’s hyped about Nvidia because of AI. Guess what? Vishay supplies components used in AI hardware, EV charging stations, and industrial automation. While Nvidia makes the sexy GPUs, Vishay sells the boring but essential resistors and capacitors that keep those GPUs from melting your motherboard. They’re eating up the market share. Recent Catalysts: Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo dropped a bombshell: Vishay is a key supplier for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI servers (GB200 series, DGX/HGX B200) and the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. These are Nvidia’s future bread-and-butter products, dominating AI and high-end gaming. Vishay replaced Infineon as Nvidia’s MOSFET supplier. Yes, Infineon, the semiconductor giant, just got sidelined. This Is MASSIVE for $VSH. Vishay is providing MOSFET/DrMOS (VRPower), vPolyTan (Polymer Tantalum Capacitors), and Current Shunt Resistors. These components are critical for Nvidia’s most cutting-edge products: • GB200 series AI servers: Nvidia’s next-gen AI infrastructure. • RTX 50 series GPUs: The next flagship graphics cards. Vishay’s vPolyTan capacitors (especially the T55 series) are already facing a supply crunch for 2025. That’s how in-demand they are. Kuo estimates that Vishay’s MOSFET production alone will contribute 20%-30% of revenue by 2025—with above-average gross profit margins. The vPolyTan capacitors will add a high single-digit percentage of revenue with significantly above-average margins. Translation? Vishay is printing money. Vishay’s production lines are already at capacity through 2025. When your biggest challenge is meeting demand, you’re in a good spot. Beyond Nvidia, Vishay is also poised to benefit from: • Automotive rebound: As EV production scales, Vishay’s components are critical. • IoT growth: Billions of devices mean billions of tiny components. Vishay is at the center of it. The Stock Is Still Cheap Even after today’s 7% jump to $18.35, $VSH is wildly undervalued. As I said earlier, the P/E ratio is still around 12-13, compared to Nvidia’s 75+. This is a company with real earnings, real dividends, and real growth potential. This is a great opportunity to make back everything you lost from your MSTR calls. Positions: Shares, 01/17/25 20C",0.5352,POSITIVE,0.9824

"Weekly jobless claims fall to 233,000, less than expected, in a positive sign for labor market.csv","Last night, the U.S. announced that the number of initial unemployment claims for last week was 233,000, significantly lower than the previous week's 249,000 and also below the market's expectation of 240,000! A few days ago, Mr. Wang mentioned that for the U.S. stock market to stop declining, the economic and labor data released must continue to be strong in order to ease concerns about a potential economic recession. Yesterday's sharp drop in initial unemployment claims marked the largest decrease in a year, indicating that the number of people recently unemployed has decreased. This alleviated the recession concerns raised by last Friday's non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate data, spurring a rally in U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 index surging over 2.3%, the largest single-day gain in 21 months 📈. On the other hand, the demand for the 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds at the auctions over the past two days was poor, causing the 10-year yield to exceed 4% once again! Tech giants saw a broad rebound, with Meta rising 4.2%, Alphabet up 1.9%, Amazon gaining 1.8%, Apple increasing 1.6%, and Microsoft rebounding 1%. Nvidia surged over 6%, returning to the $100 mark, leading to a rebound in semiconductor stocks. Broadcom, Micron, and Applied Materials all jumped more than 6%, while Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and AMD all saw gains of over 5%! Taiwan's ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) also rebounded, with TSMC and UMC both jumping more than 6%, and ASE gaining over 4%. However, it's still important to note that the number of continuing unemployment claims is rising, reaching its highest level since November 2021, nearly three years ago! Therefore, Wall Street's foreign investors remain concerned about the economy. For example, JPMorgan still believes the U.S. economy will enter a recession, raising the probability from 25% to 35%!

Why I am going long on Intel and letting Bad Daddy Gelsinger take me to Uranus - DD TurboNerd Post.csv,"TLDR: This stock fucking sucks, and I love it. But the developing foundry business is gonna get absolutely bananas under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for the sole purpose of developing it. They are not gonna let the other chip companies continue to take nut shots on them and they are just gonna make everyone chips for them. Anyways I all in on Mar 2025 Calls (which are like $4.50 - $5.00) right now. Here is some DD. Dog of the Dow Intel has lagged behind other chip titans such as [[AMD - AMD]] and [[NVDA -NVIDIA]] as they race to design and build chips to handle [[AI]] workloads. Both AMD and NVIDA have seen tremendous growth over the past 18 months (as of June 2024). A growth pattern that has gone completely unanswered by INTEL up until this point. Looking at the [[Price to Earnings Ratio]] of both AMD and NVIDIA it is easy to see how disconnected from earnings they have become (though they are both incredibly profitable). AMD P/E Ratio: 67.30 NVIDIA P/E Ratio: 238.53 INTEL P/E Ratio 31.79 AMD is wildly inflated relative to its competition in the space. NVDA is has a more ""sane"" price to earnings but it has also been nearly printing its own money with the amount of sales it has been making. The price of NVIDIA still ""feels"" high despite it's recent split. Another interesting metric to take a look at is the [[Price/Tangible Book]] - Where you take the current price of the stock and compare it to the tangle value of all its assets minus good will. AMD P/TB Ratio: 23.61 NVIDIA P/TB Ratio: 64.73 INTEL P/TB Ratio: 1.75 This says a few things; One either Intel has barely any assets worth liquidating relative to its stock price and the market has priced the stock appropriately, OR the price of the stock is selling for a very reasonable price related to the actual value of the company. This could be considered paying only .75 above book value of the company as a ""premium"" for future expected value. Source: Any trading platform that has data you ding dongs - go look it up. I got these from Schwab jfc. Technical Except for this past Wednesday, this company has been hard stuck around $30 after a selloff from its 52 week high of $51.28. 31.50 appears to be the most reliable resistance level we can work off of right now, then $32.50 after that. If it breaks both of those on a run up, there is literally no ceiling until $46. SO, you tell me what that means. The further you zoom out on your shitty little trading app the more you will see that this period we are in is nothing but consolidation. Foundry Intel's new foundry business will be the corner stone of its future growth. Forget the in house made chips. The company is not-so-silently tyring to be the American version of TSMC. Here is an article they posted on their own site outlining their model. https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-outlines-new-financial-reporting-structure.html#gs.a8z07s Note this section: April 9th 2024 ""Intel Foundry is a newly established operating segment that includes foundry technology development, foundry manufacturing and supply chain, and foundry services (formerly IFS). Under this new structure, Intel Foundry will recognize revenues generated from both external foundry customers and Intel Products..."" Fuck me, if they pull this off under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for this specific function, this stock could easily moon. Not to mention this article detailing that NVIDIA will start using Intels Foundry to start making its own chips. https://www.techspot.com/news/101725-nvidia-turning-intel-foundry-services-expand-gpu-ai.html#:~:text=Nvidia%20could%20also%20choose%20to,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202024. Chips Act ""U.S. Department of Commerce has proposed up to $8.5 billion in direct funding through the CHIPS and Science Act to advance Intel’s commercial semiconductor projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon. Intel also expects to benefit from a U.S. Treasury Department Investment Tax Credit (ITC) of up to 25% on more than $100 billion in qualified investments and eligibility for federal loans up to $11 billion. Proposed funding supports Intel’s previously announced plans to invest more than $100 billion in the U.S. over five years to expand U.S. chipmaking capacity and capabilities critical to economic and national security and acceleration of emerging technologies, such as AI. Intel’s investments are expected to create more than 10,000 company jobs and nearly 20,000 construction jobs, and to support more than 50,000 indirect jobs with suppliers and supporting industries. "" https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/us-chips-act-intel-direct-funding.html#gs.a8z5ze So yea Intel is gonna get paid, and quite a bit. The article states that they are slated to receive up to $8.5 billion, with a B. X86 chips - Speculation With Arm taking dominance over portable computers like laptops, tablets and phones, X86 looks pretty boring. Except you have to remember that both AMD and Intel are still cranking these bad boys out like nobody's business. The raw horsepower in these for desktop workstations and servers is still not matched by ARM and probably wont be for quite a while. Sure they are not quite as power efficient, but who cares in a data center or major compute space anyways. Intel owns almost all of the IP for X86 processors too. AMD has a little bit and they have made improvements and designs of their own that they have been able to patent, but INTEL is the OG maker of these chips. Arm will probably continue to dominate the landscape, but they are the people who license their chips are going to need them made somewhere. They will have like two options. Intel or TSMC. China What happens when CHYNA pulls the trigger and takes over Taiwan. Where is everyone gonna have their chips made? Arizona, that's where. TSMC and Intel are both setting up MASSIVE Fabs there. So, when all the other chip companies get absolutely smoked I expect to see a giant green candle on that morning for INTC. I will probably write more later but this shit got way long way fast.

Why I bought Puts on MNST (Monster).csv,"Since Monster releases its earnings report after market, it’s time for some puts… or calls if you are based and want to inverse me Reason 1: High expectations - Current expectations for this quarterly are quite high.. Expected earnings per share are $0.452 as opposed to the $0.400 of a year ago . In this same light the market expects (has already priced in) a nearly 200 million dollar increase in revenue from the year prior.. Put quite simply these massive increases are already expected and priced in, and it’s much easier to fall short when expectations are this high Reason 2: Competition - PepsiCo is fighting hard for market share of the energy drink market and threw $550 million dollars for an 8.5% share of Celsius in 2022. Monster has already struggled to maintain market share versus Red Bull, which owns the largest portion of the energy drink market.. Now on top of this already stiff competition they have to deal with a whale like PepsiCo flooding the market with products like Rockstar and Celsius over time Reason 3: regulation- As more health focused initiatives take place in Europe and America, products like monster will face increased scrutiny, both from consumers and governments alike (regulations on certain contents). Reason 4: Even those who hit their goals have been getting smashed… AMD and Reddit- Now I get what you are thinking “what the heck do these companies have to do with monster”… and yea they have no direct relationship.. But even after surpassing their goals for this last quarter these companies have seen their value get smashed.. The market is being mad weird and bearish right now when it comes to earnings. So in essence this combined with reason 1 (the high goals they already have), means that I feel that the odds favor the Put/bear side Hope you enjoyed my presentation!!

"Why I think Intel is a Misunderstood, Undervalued Play – A Bet on 18A (+EV DD).csv","Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking.

Why Intel is the most undervalued tech stock right now.csv,"Intel ($INTC) is an insane bargain right now, as it is trading at year 1999 stock price. Every other comparable tech stock is up 5000%-20000% since then. People are too focused on Intel consumer and data center products, which by the way are improving at impressive rate. Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3). Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD & NVIDIA offerings. But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment. Currently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons. Microsoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in. If you are a big tech company and want the best, cutting edge silicon you will have to switch to Intel foundry sooner or later.

I don't do options so maybe this is the wrong place lmao. I moved back home to my parents place when my dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Truthfully this has been the worst year of my life (and his obviously) in a lot of ways, but I've been investing since I was 16 (I'm 25 now). My dad worked in equities, so when he lost his ability to communicate effectively with me (and since I had significantly more income because I'm not paying rent) - I truthfully went ballistic on investing. Pretty much said fuck it, I'm living at home I don't need a 6 month emergency fund till I move out and went all-in. Granted 40% of my portfolio not listed here is in a 401k account entirely in the S&P 500 (set & forget just in case my equities went to hell as with the rest of my life lol). I believe in the margin of safety when investing. I like to invest in high-quality companies that generate lots of cash as the backbone of my portfolio. Since 2021 (before my dad got this cancer shit), I spoke with him and he basically said just look at the fundamentals of a company and invest in growth companies that you think will be around in 5-10 years. I look for value within growth stocks (i know paradoxical). Some of my icons in investing are David Tepper & Michael Burry. Again below is all my own experience and reflects only my own views and are not a recommendation of my company (corporate. disclaimer). My portfolio is heavily weighted (85%) between several stocks: AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL (So fucking cheap r u kidding me sorry), NVDA, AMZN, AMD, CRM, COST, RIVN (RIP), AVGO, VOO (ik not a stock) <-- I know semi(s) are very cyclical but i believe in holding all of these companies for 5-10 years, so I don't have to worry about temp. earnings beats/misses etc. Much easier to pick a stock and hold it for a while then it is to get the timing right. Roughly at 175% return in the past 3 years. (hammered META at $100's, NVDA at $200 both in 2022) Roughly 15% of my bets are moonshots (note the word bet hehe) with promise but objectively could be overvalued/bad investments: CCL/RCL (both are crushing it and between them own 75% of the cruise line market), LCID/RIVN (going to 0 bc they can't scale profitably or will make u a very happy person 3 years down the line bc R2/Atlas at 45k/50k should capture a significant portion of model y demand), TTD, DKNG/FLUT - gambling hasn't even been legalized in Cali/Texas (the biggest markets in the U.S. come on), RBLX (feels like betting against youtube in the early innings w/o realizing how much rev. they're actually recognizing), PYPL (value - cheap af (bought at $60) should turn around in a couple years) I joke I allocate like google's budget where it's 90% bread&butter and the rest are moonshots. Was very depressed (still reasonably depressed) because I'm not sure how much time my dad has. I hope in a way I can pass some of these stocks to my kid in a better place than I found it.

Morgan Stanley anticipates that AMD's core business will ""accelerate meaningfully"" as the PC market continues to recover and server upgrades resume. The investment firm noted that AMD is likely to capture a disproportionate share of these larger projects as upgrades progress. AMD's increased Q3 revenue guidance of about $6.7 billion at the midpoint reflects ""strong momentum across compute businesses,"" according to Morgan Stanley. This momentum underscores the company's effective strategy and execution, positioning it well for sustained growth. Artificial intelligence is also expected to be a significant growth driver for AMD. The company's advancements in AI technology and its strategic roadmap place it in a favorable position to capitalize on the burgeoning AI market. While there are potential delays in the deployment of new AI silicon, the overall outlook remains robust. Morgan Stanley maintains an equal-weight rating on Advanced Micro Devices and has raised its price target to $178 from $176, reflecting confidence in the company's future performance. AMD's strategic positioning and continued execution of its roadmap suggest a promising trajectory.

AI chipmaker Cerebras files for IPO to take on Nvidia - But 87% of its revenues have come from the U.csv,"The Middle East wants chips badly but US restrictions prevent the US most powerful chips entering into certain geographical areas such as China and the Middle East; this entails the UAE. Nevertheless, the UAE wants in on the GPU chips craze and is apparently willing to pay anything to enter into the chip bonanza. The UAE can't get Nvidia's, AMD's, or Intel's best GPU chips so instead they are investing heavily into alternatives such as Cerebras. There is nothing inherently wrong with this but it's also the biggest red flag as an investment opportunity. If the agreements for Nvidia chips open up in the Middle East and specifically with the UAE that could be a crushing blow to this aspiring startup. Specifically, Cerebras Systems reported a net loss of $66.6 million for the first six months of 2024, on $136.4 million in revenue. For the same period in 2023 it has a net loss of $77.8 million on just $8.7 million in sales. 87% of this revenue for the first half of 2024 was directly from the UAE G42. The other red flag from this startup is the way in which they promote their business. It's all seemingly smoke and mirrors and conveniently based on outdated GPU pricing and throughput information; which is very publically available. For some reason, Groq and Cerebras love to keep using memory to unlock speeds on small/tiny models which is impractical and inefficient for a scaled system; or a system that is a large foundational LLM. As well, they have no clue what models will do next so it's a major after the fact architecture that uses llama because they have access to it. https://cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebras-inference-ai-at-instant-speed. A prime example of this is OpenAI's GPT-o1 model that uses reasoning in coordination with its model capabilities. Because they are not being used on the forefront of this technology they don't know how or when a model's size, function, or needs will evolve into the future. All of this plus the pricing from OpenAI and Microsoft is coming down exponentially. For Example: They are referring to a 70b param model that shoves an entire model onto memory. They are going up against h100's which is a very old technology at this point. They make no reference to h200's let alone blackwell Because they are referencing such a small model the pricing model they suggest would be radically different for a 400b param model and forget about trillion param models which are coming next. They're not being truthful about tokens per s. As of today this is Azure GPT 4o and GPT 4 mini tokens per minute gpt-4o & GPT-4 Turbo global standard Model Tier Quota Limit in tokens per minute (TPM) Requests per minute gpt-4o Enterprise agreement 30 M 180 K gpt-4o-mini Enterprise agreement 50 M 300 As you can clearly see 30 million tokens per minute is 500k tokens per second and mini is 833,333 tokens per second. So i don't know why they are referring to 20 tokens per second or their 450 tokens per second seems way off. maybe they mean million. Even if that is the case and 70 b would be more like mini it is way higher than their limit. On pricing which they lay out a 3:1 input versus output is fine the price would be for mini which is a comparable model is roughly .10 cents (input) + .20 cents = .30 cents. Per million. for regular 4o it would be higher and let's face it GPT 4o is a far superior model than llama 3.1 3.33 dollar + 5 = $8.33 Source: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/ From this information what I can tell you is that what we just went over is pricing. it is not some guarantee for what a model produces per second. That shit is very random. What I can tell you is from GPT 4 to GPT 4 turbo to Gpt 4o the speed is dramatically better. GPT 4o mini is damn near real time. Take that for what it's worth. I am not saying they're being dishonest here but I am saying they are being very cheeky with how they advertise things. The company is currently being primarily supported by the UAE, with investments worth roughly $900 million for new AI supercomputers known as the Condor Galaxy series. Any growth here is singular to this source of investment and not driven by organic growth or usage. This is not a competitor to Nvidia but rather a temporary solution in the Middle East until chip embargoes are alleviated. The media here loves to use sexy headlines on non-technical verifications of what it is they are actually comparing. I.e. H100's are now old, or The fact an entity may need to serve millions of clients... No they are instead reporting self-prompting headlines from Cerebras that say things like our chips are 20x faster than Nvidia. Live Update: As I am writing and researching this topic it has just been reported by Reuters that the U.S. is setting a new rule to allow chip shipments to the Middle East including the UAE which is a boon to Nvidia and Microsoft. US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East Here are couple excerpts: WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), to data centers in the Middle East. G42, a UAE-based AI company with historic ties to China, has been a focus of those concerns. In April, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), opens new tab announced that it would invest $1.5 billion in the company, with plans to provide G42 with chips and model weights, sophisticated data that improves an AI model's ability to emulate human reasoning.The deal drew scrutiny from China hardliners in Congress, even though G42 said in February that it had divested from China and was accepting constraints imposed on it by the United States to work with American companies. LOL you can't make this up. Literally this just got reported by Reuters today 9/30/2024. This completely aligns with my argument above regarding the UAE-G42. With chips now entering into the Middle East from Nvidia and potentially others I don't know how this startup IPO makes it off the ground. I don't mean to be bearish but I don't think this is the time for them to raise an IPO without showing more progress. I could be wrong. As of now, I don't plan on buying any shares. Instead, I will be adding more shares into Nvidia because now this is bullish news for Nvidia.",0.5441,NEGATIVE,1.0

AMD CEO Lisa Su Says AI Is In Early Stages Of Multiyear 'Supercycle' 'There's Tremendous Need For Mo.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) shares are experiencing an upward trend after the company reported strong second-quarter financial results. Following the announcement, CEO Lisa Su emphasized that the chipmaker’s performance is being driven by a multiyear AI “supercycle.” What To Know: Recently, chip stocks saw a sell-off as earnings season approached, with investors questioning the timeline for significant returns on the massive investments in AI. This led to speculation that spending on AI might slow down. However, early earnings reports indicate that capital expenditures have remained robust. Su’s comments on CNBC’s “Squawk On The Street” Wednesday provide reassurance against slowdown concerns. She stated, “From the conversations that I have with our customer set and sort of the broader industry, we can see that AI is a multiyear, you know, I would call it a supercycle frankly. There’s tremendous need for more compute.” AMD reported second-quarter revenue of $5.835 billion and adjusted earnings of 69 cents per share, surpassing analyst estimates as its AI business continues to see accelerating demand. The chipmaker also updated its forecast, expecting GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion this year, up from the previous forecast of more than $4 billion. Su highlighted that analysts and investors are “hypersensitive” to minor quarter-over-quarter changes. She believes that the AI story should be viewed in a broader context, suggesting that the demand is extraordinarily high. “I wouldn’t be hypersensitive in those areas ... Are more customers using it? Is every enterprise asking for it? Are we seeing more applications on a daily, weekly, monthly basis? The answer to that is absolutely yes,” she said. “Everywhere I go, everyone wants to talk about how can we incorporate AI into our businesses faster and more efficiently ... this early in the cycle, there’s a lot of learning and experimentation, but definitely, there will be the return on the investment on the other side,” Su added. Although the return on investment isn’t “instantaneous,” it’s occurring very quickly. AI is already boosting productivity and enabling companies to bring better products to market faster. Su emphasized, “We’re investing today for the return in a couple of years, and I think that’s absolutely the right thing to do. That’s the way to think about these investment cycles.” AMD’s strategic focus on AI and its strong financial performance underscore its robust position in the rapidly evolving technology landscape, highlighting the company’s potential for sustained growth in the coming years.",0.5537,NEGATIVE,0.8673

Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year. This report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure. With Nvidia's earnings report on the horizon, AMD's results offer a useful benchmark. Although AMD has significantly underperformed Nvidia year-to-date, this could be an opportunity to turn the tables. Data Center Growth is Key Analysts predict AMD's data center revenue will reach a record $3.52 billion for Q3. In July, CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in strong revenue growth for the year's second half, driven by demand for Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. Earlier this month, AMD launched its latest data center AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, and investors are keen to see its performance.

"Apple reportedly seeks to lock out its competitors from TSMC's 2nm process, by booking all of its ma.csv","Apple has long been cozy with TSMC, the manufacturer of the chips that end up in ever-popular iPhone, iPad and Mac products. When you've got as much cash on hand as Apple does, it puts it in a favorable position to negotiate deals with the Taiwan-based chipmaker. Now it is reportedly seeking to lock in 100% of TSMC's bleeding edge 2nm production capacity, giving it a competitive advantage when products eventually make their way to the market. According to 9to5mac (via Extreme tech), Apple's chief operating officer met with TSMC bosses to negotiate terms to secure 2nm capacity. The report cites 'local sources', so there needs to be a pinch of salt here, but given Apple's track record of locking up TSMC's capacity, this would certainly come as no surprise. TSMC's 2nm process is currently scheduled to enter risk production in 2025, with volume production set for the second half of 2025. That means the upcoming iPhone 16 family with A18 chips will stick with 3nm, but it could mean the high end iPhone 17 Pro and Max could be the first in line to be built with 2nm technology. The specifics of deals between TSMC and its customers are obviously not made public, but it is widely accepted that Apple booked all of TSMC's 3nm capacity, at least for a period of time. These chips, including the A17 and M3 families made their way into the latest generation iPhone 15 Pros and MacBooks. That would make Apple's 2nm play unsurprising. It's easy to see why Apple would attempt to secure the maximum amount of 2nm capacity. It will give it an advantage over its competitors, as 2nm chips will allow Apple to pack in more transistors into a given area, leading to better performance or lower power consumption—if not both. Samsung has its own manufacturing capacity, and future Exynos chips will be built in-house, but 2nm Snapdragon and possibly Google Tensor chips may have to wait in line behind Apple. Even mega-companies such as Google and Qualcomm don't have the cash on hand to outbid big daddy Apple. It's not just Arm competitors that will be disadvantaged. Nvidia will want every possible power and performance advantage it can get as it dominates the market for AI processors, while AMD will also have to wait for access to the best nodes.

This new open standards alliance (UALink Promoter Group) for the interconnect (a.k.a backbone) of server clusters challenges NVDA's own proprietary interconnect systems, but will likely not be able to compete with the new B200 line being delivered in the coming months, due to its extreme efficiencies across GPUs and clusters.

Bloomberg Again Reports on Semiconductors With Flimsy Information on Secret Government Contacts.csv,"Usually, when things that are leaked with an intention the entity where the leak comes from is pleased with said leak. Not for Bloomberg though. Bloomberg actually accomplishes citing an anonymous source about on ongoing discussions related to chip distribution and subsequently takes that information to the White House National Security Council to ask them to comment. Here is the WHNSC's response. Bloomberg: US Weighs Capping Exports of AI Chips From Nvidia and AMD to Some Countries A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the talks but pointed to a recent joint statement by the US and UAE on artificial intelligence. In it, the two countries acknowledged the “tremendous potential of AI for good,” as well as the “challenges and risks of this emerging technology and the vital importance of safeguards.” The council responds with a no comment while directing them to a positive statement. To me, this greatly diminishes whomever the Bloomberg contact is. This is the second time that Bloomberg goes out of their way citing a leaky government source that on it's own merits isn't really that sensational at all. The headline is sensational the reality is not. The approach would set a ceiling on export licenses for certain countries in the interest of national security, according to the people, who described the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Officials are focused on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing appetite for AI data centers and the deep pockets to fund them, the people said. This isn't even news. Reuters reported on this a month ago with a much more neutral to positive tone. Which it is. Reuters: US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia to data centers in the Middle East.Since October 2023, U.S. exporters have been required to obtain licenses before shipping advanced chips to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.Under the new rule, data centers will be able to apply for Validated End User status that will allow them to receive chips under a general authorization, rather than requiring their U.S. suppliers to obtain individual licenses to ship to them. If you're tracking, this simply seems to be the 2nd half of that original conversation. There are already chip restrictions. Nvidia is already not delivering the most advanced chips to those countries. The framework proposed would allow Nvidia to deliver chips under certain restrictions and guidelines. Bloomberg acknowledges this towards the tail end of the article. While officials have debated the best approach, they’ve slowed high-volume AI chip license approvals to the Middle East and elsewhere. But there are signs things could get moving soon: Under the new rules for shipments to data centers, US officials will vet and preapprove specific customers based on security commitments from both the companies and their national governments, paving the way for easier licensing down the road. What I don't understand is why does Bloomberg like to make things salacious when they're seemingly not. There is 0 chips to parts of the Middle-East today, but the U.S. government is working on a framework that may relieve that. Reuter story from a month ago. The end.

Could PLTR go on a TSLA-like Run (70%) if Included in SP500.csv,"On June 7th, S&P 500 is set to rebalance and Palantir will be eligible for the third time. With the spotlight on AI and Palantir's continued strong performance, there's a very high likelihood it is included in the S&P, which could lead PLTR going on a Tesla-like run. First, let me break down why Palantir is a great candidate for inclusion. Inclusion in the S&P 500 index involves meeting several stringent criteria related to market capitalization, liquidity, financial viability, and corporate governance. For Palantir Technologies (PLTR) to be considered a good candidate for S&P 500 inclusion, it must satisfy these key requirements: Market Capitalization: A company must have a market cap of at least $14.6 billion (as of 2023). Palantir's market capitalization has been above this threshold for a while. Liquidity: Companies need to have adequate liquidity, with a high trading volume. Palantir's shares are actively traded, reflecting strong investor interest and sufficient liquidity. Financial Viability: The company must report positive earnings in the most recent quarter and over the last four quarters combined. Palantir has demonstrated profitability, reporting positive GAAP EPS in recent quarters (InvestorPlace). U.S. Based: Companies must be U.S.-based, with the majority of their assets and revenues derived from the U.S. Palantir fits this criterion, being headquartered in Denver, Colorado, and deriving significant revenue from U.S. operations. Public Float: At least 50% of a company's shares must be in the public float. Palantir's public float percentage is adequate to meet this requirement, with substantial institutional ownership indicating wide distribution among public shareholders Palantir meets all the eligibility criteria, the only which could be a problem is corporate governance, ie, the insiders own a lot of shares of the company; however there are tons of examples of other companies that have a similar structure. As many of you know, Tesla went on a 70% in the weeks leading up to and the month following its inclusion. However, it's not alone. Many other ""sexy/high-profile"" names go on epic runs when SP500 inclusion is announced. Twitter (TWTR) Inclusion Date: June 7, 2018 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $26 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on May 21, 2018, Twitter's stock increased by approximately 14%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, Twitter's stock increased by about 5%. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2019 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2019, NXP's stock rose by approximately 10%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, NXP's stock increased by around 6%. AMD (Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.) (AMD) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2017 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $20 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2017, AMD's stock increased by approximately 12%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, AMD's stock rose by around 9%. T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS) Inclusion Date: June 22, 2020 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on June 5, 2020, T-Mobile's stock increased by approximately 8%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, T-Mobile's stock saw an increase of about 7%. NVIDIA (NVDA) Inclusion Date: November 18, 2001 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $25 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: NVIDIA's stock saw a significant rise, roughly around 20-25%, in the weeks leading up to the inclusion. Month Following Inclusion: The stock continued to perform well, with an additional increase of around 10-15%. ""S&P 500 effect,"" is a real phenomenon and I think it's even more powerful with high-profile names like Palantir. As mentioned earlier, Tesla went on a god-like run in the weeks leading up to and after the announcement. And I think Palantir shares many characteristics with Tesla that may see it go on a similar run. Both companies have a very high-profile CEO. Alex Karp is loved by Palantir holders just like Elon is by Tesla fanboys, which leads to my most important point: retail ownership. Palantir has a significant amount of its shares outstanding owned by retail; if SP500 inclusion is announced and institutions have to buy shares it may create a similar move like Tesla's as most palantir fanboys won't sell. Like Tesla, they believe Palantir is changing the world (look at their subreddit). I think buying Palantir options is a great upside play with limited downside, depending on when you purchase your options. The inclusion announcement is on Friday after hours, so you could buy Friday before close or anytime this week and sell Monday morning if its not included for a minimum loss. And with options being so cheap, this could be a 50-bagger if it goes to 30 bucks. 6/21 23 C 6/21 25 C.",0.5557,POSITIVE,0.7174

How Terrifying is the Start of August.csv,"Just over the past three trading days, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 indices have all recorded their largest three-day cumulative decline since June 2022! Last night, the Nasdaq plummeted by over 6% at one point, and the S&P 500 dropped by more than 4%, with both indices returning to their early May levels by the close of trading. Although the major U.S. indices and individual stocks still closed with significant losses, the intraday declines were somewhat moderated. The primary reason for this was the release of the U.S. July ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, which rebounded from a four-year low in June to 51.4, exceeding market expectations and returning to the expansion zone above 50! Sub-indices, including the New Orders Index and Employment Index, also showed growth. Notably, the Employment Index reached 51.1, marking the largest increase since September of last year and the first time this year that it has entered the expansion zone above 50. This data slightly alleviated fears from last week's significant non-farm payroll decline, making the market believe that the drop in new jobs was primarily due to Hurricane Barry hitting Texas. 👉 As discussed previously, the sharp decline in U.S. stocks at the start of August stemmed from worries about the U.S. economy falling into recession. Therefore, when the ISM Non-Manufacturing number showed growth yesterday, it somewhat restored market confidence in the economy, helping to narrow the intraday losses of U.S. stocks. The U.S. stock market now needs to see positive economic growth news to recover, unlike before when everyone was hoping for bad news, anticipating a Federal Reserve interest rate cut! Hence, it is crucial to continue monitoring other economic data. If strong and robust growth numbers do not consistently appear, investors will remain concerned about an economic recession, and the trend of selling stocks for cash will not end.

I wait all year for this opportunity - now I'm going to share it with you.csv,"If you trade long enough, you begin to see patterns emerge. On October 30th, one of my favorite patterns is starting. If you buy AMD stock on the last Monday of October, the average return for the rest of the year is 24.52%, and the stock is higher 88.89% of the time. This data starts in 2015 because it is the first full year after Dr. Lisa Su became CEO of AMD. Some of you may be wondering why this period is so strong for AMD stock. Let me share my personal theory. AMD depends on TSMC for chip manufacturing. Taiwan is protected by its geography and weather, but the Chinese have two windows of opportunity to cross the Strait with favorable weather. The first is from late March to the end of April. The second is from late September to late October. Last year, China launched major military exercises around Taiwan in April. This year, they did it in October, which just ended a few days ago. (They also launch these exercises when they are provoked, such as when Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan or during the recent Taiwanese elections.) In my view, the end of October triggers a relief rally in stocks related to TSMC, most notably AMD and Nvidia. This combines with earnings and strong seasonality, resulting in massive outperformance in a relatively short period of time. A quick word of warning—this time period includes earnings. If you want to avoid earnings risk, you can wait until the first Monday of November. If you wait until November, the average return is 19.06%, and the stock is higher 77.78% of the time by the end of the year. Here is a quick comparison I do all this shit manually so I apologize if there is an error in one of my calculations. My positions: Long 1000 shares with a cost basis of $157.90. Although I am considering switching to a risk reversal. I would use a risk reversal selling the Jan. 2025 $155 puts collecting 12.70 then using that to buy twice as many Jan. 2025 $180 calls for $6.50 (I would buy x2 as many calls to make the net cost ~.30)",0.5754,NEGATIVE,0.8872

Their unmatched tech and visionary leadership have set the bar high. However, with the U.S. aiming to maintain its global leadership, relying on a single company for AI tech could become a security risk and a bottleneck in innovation. Why Intel Could Be the Game-Changer? Intel (INTC) is uniquely positioned to disrupt NVIDIA's monopoly. Alongside AMD, Intel possesses the expertise and resources needed to engineer AI chips. Enter Gaudi 3. If Gaudi 3 lives up to the hype, Intel’s stock could potentially skyrocket, doubling in value in a matter of months hands down. Government Backing: The U.S. government and major institutions are already showing their support for Intel, recognizing its strategic importance in the tech race. Positive Vibes: Reviews for Intel's Arrow Lake architecture are rolling in with strong positives, indicating that Intel's on the right track to regain dominance.

INTC - A dumb person's retrospective.csv,"I'm lazy and you regards don't like to read so I'll leave it to bullet points and you can piece them together. Intel was seen as a bargain in 2023 compared to NVDA and AMD after their 400% run up. US gov have vested interest in Intel. No they are not propping Intel up, but it's effectively giving Intel a big loan to buy a second house. That loan can pay off if the housing market goes up, or they are double fucked because they leveraged to buy a second house. If you bought Intel because china will invade Taiwan, you are really regarded. If China invades Taiwan, everything is going to sell. That's a disruption of global trade on WW2 levels. Your best case scenario still loses you money. Intel bullish scenario is 18A, High-Na EUV paying dividends, early experience granting them a year technological lead over TSMC. It doesn't have to work, but the upside is a 10x from these levels. TSMC pass up High NA EUV is repeating the same decision Intel did in 2012 when Intel controlled the market and did not view EUV as economically feasible. Again, doesn't mean TSMC is incorrect in their assessment, but history does repeat itself. Intel bearish scenario is just repeat of 2016 and delay after delay. In which case they head to legacy company status like Ford. Anyone else remember all the Ford bulls in 2016? They're not on this sub anymore because they all went broke. I'm no crayon guy. But everyone can see that $30 was a magic line, and drastically going below it to $21 is a market signal that the company is now viewed fundamentally differently. Yes it can go lower, especially the general market trends change we see this week. AMD spent from 2008 to 2016 an absolute garbage penny stock. You WSBers nowadays don't even know how ridiculed you were for even considering AMD. 2015 to 2017 were peak AMD years on this sub when regards jumped the gun, bought calls because MUH mindfactory data and muh 1% min benchmarks losing them everything over and over again. You kids don't even know struggle. Struggle is putting your 1k paycheck on AMD calls every week thinking this week you will hit. Just to watch Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs dropping a $12 PT downgrade on you when the stock turns even a little bullish. The investment only somewhat paid off in 2018 when AMD traded to 30, but then half the regards lost everything (myself included) when it crashed to 18 in 2 months following Powell's rate hike. Look how quickly sentiment changed for AMD from 2018. This very well could be history repeating itself, as the semiconductor companies have demonstrated over and over again. Intel 18A is a repeat situation of AMD ZEN. The upside cannot be understated. I'm still bullish. Proper execution can bring the company to a $200+ stock. I bought and sold Intel throughout the year. 8000 shares from 35 to 50, sold at 43, bought at 35, sold at 30 before earnings. I was up 130k, lost 100k of it. Bought 2500 shares at 21.30.

Intel - Pinnacle of failure.csv,"Intel's Slippery Slope: Financial Woes, Investor Distrust, and Leadership Issues Intel Corporation, once a dominant force in the tech industry, is now grappling with a series of significant challenges that have fueled a troubling decline. Despite attempts to project a positive outlook, the company’s current trajectory suggests a troubling downward spiral. Financial Performance and Market Challenges Intel's financial performance has continued to deteriorate. For the first half of 2024, Intel reported revenues of $24 billion, marking a slight decrease compared to previous periods. This decline is occurring amid a broader tech sector recovery and highlights Intel’s struggle to maintain its competitive edge. The company's net income for this period was a mere $800 million, translating to a profit margin of approximately 3.3%, indicating substantial operational inefficiencies and intense competition from rivals such as AMD and NVIDIA. Declining Customer Satisfaction and Product Concerns Customer dissatisfaction remains a critical issue. The release of Intel's 14th Gen Core processors has not addressed the performance inconsistencies that plagued previous models. While the company has introduced new features, reviews suggest that these updates have not significantly improved reliability or performance compared to competitors. This ongoing issue is eroding customer trust and impacting market share. Eroding Investor Confidence Investor confidence in Intel is faltering. The recent involvement of Apollo Global Management has raised concerns, particularly following Apollo’s controversial investment decisions in other sectors. Additionally, a recent lawsuit filed by major institutional investors alleges mismanagement and failure to deliver on key performance promises. This legal battle has further shaken confidence, prompting several large investors to divest from Intel, exacerbating the company's financial strain. Leadership and Legal Troubles Intel's leadership is facing intense scrutiny. Recent high-profile exits, including the departure of several senior executives, have led to a perception of instability at the top. The company's reliance on legal strategies to address its challenges, rather than focusing on operational and strategic improvements, appears to be aggravatinh its difficulties. This reactive approach is not addressing the underlying issues affecting Intel’s performance. Future Prospects and Potential Downturn Intel’s future prospects remain uncertain. Despite a significant $15 billion R&D budget, the company’s progress in key areas like AI and autonomous driving lags behind that of its more agile competitors. Moreover, while short-term production issues in Taiwan have provided some temporary relief, these are unlikely to reverse the long-term downward trend. The competitive landscape continues to evolve rapidly, and Intel’s slower adaptation could hinder its recovery prospects. TL;DR Intel’s current strategy, which includes overhauling its product lineup and executive team, appears to be a desperate attempt to stabilize its position. For investors and stakeholders, the warning signs are clear: Intel’s challenges are substantial, and the company’s efforts to turn things around may not be sufficient in the face of ongoing and evolving issues.

Intel is a good buy.csv,"We are all well aware Intel is having it's own Boeing moment right now with design flaws in their CPUs and horrible customer service. They deserve the steaming pile dooky that is currently sitting atop their share value. That being said, they have an ace that may flip the entire market on it's head: They own their fabs. That's right: all the other big boys in town design and give their blueprints for TSMC to manufacture. That's true of AMD, Nvidia, and other ARM and mobile chip designers. Intel is the only large scale chip designers that is more or less vertically integrated. As you may know, they just got $8.8B from papa Biden to build more foundries in Ohio and Arizona, in addition to their other sites across the world. None of this is particularly noteworthy until you consider that China has always been very interested in Chinesing Taiwan, and are even more so now that they have been embargoed from Nvidia chips by the US. The Chinese military build-up over the past decade has focused heavily on amphibious warfare, and long range anti-naval weapons (think carrier buster ballistic/boost-glide stand off weapons.) It doesn't take a Ph.D in geopolitics to understand what the move is here. On the US/allied side, the discourse around Taiwan has slowly shifted: what started out as ""we have overwhelming force and we will stop any attempt at an invasion of Taiwan"" has become something like ""Maybe we can't stop them from invading, but we can make it a Pyrrhic victory"". This may actually be the case, but the trend is not great. You will have noticed Taiwan has been increasingly politically isolated, mirroring the growing Chinese military power in the region. So what happens to TSMC if Taiwan gets Chinesed? As you can imagine, China is interested in acquiring as many TSMC assets and personnel intact as possible. This means you can bet your degenerate bacon that US intelligence services have contingencies to extradite key scientists and engineers, and scuttle the production plants and machines before the Chinese can take control of them. But the result is easy to predict: no more TSMC. This means the personnel extradited will be used to advise and run US production plants owned by, you guessed it: Intel. Intel will have a quasi monopoly on chip manufacturing. The US government see this of course, that's why they are strongly nudging Nvidia to play nice with Intel, because they see a potential future where Intel is the only player in town capable of making Nvidia chips, or any consumer chips at all for that matter, in the West.

Intel is a pretty safe bet and are undervalued.csv,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs. An additional benefit is that Intel can leverage their fabs in order to achieve higher margins for their own products. It's possible Intel's stock could be hit again in a month or so when their report comes out, but they are likely already at bottom.",0.5493,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Is INTC undervalued .csv,"Valuation Analysis of Intel Corporation Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has long been a key player in the semiconductor industry, but recent market developments and the rise of competitors like AMD and Nvidia have caused its stock to significantly underperform relative to its peers. As of Q2 2024, Intel’s total assets amount to approximately $182 billion, with liabilities around $91 billion, resulting in a net asset value of $91 billion. Yet, its market capitalization is around $95 billion, reflecting an almost 1:1 ratio between market cap and net assets. In contrast, competitors such as AMD and Nvidia trade at significantly higher premiums, indicating that the market may be underpricing Intel’s growth potential. Company Market Cap (Billion $) Net Assets (Billion $) Price to Net Asset Ratio Intel 95 91 1.04 AMD 266 56.5 4.71 Nvidia 3,000 58.15 51.58 Understanding Intel’s Valuation The Price to Net Asset Ratio (P/NAV) is a critical measure of how the market values a company relative to its net assets. Intel's current P/NAV of 1.04 reveals that its market value is nearly identical to its net assets, a valuation that appears surprisingly low, particularly when compared to its competitors. AMD and Nvidia, for instance, demonstrate P/NAV ratios of 4.71 and 51.58, respectively. This significant gap highlights the possibility that Intel is undervalued, especially given its strong fundamentals and growth potential. Several factors support this assessment. Despite facing fierce competition, Intel remains a leader in the semiconductor industry, known for its quality and innovation. The company is making substantial investments in new technologies and manufacturing capabilities, positioning itself to capitalize on growing trends such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, Intel boasts a robust balance sheet, with total assets of about $182 billion and liabilities around $91 billion. This financial strength provides a solid foundation for future growth and strategic initiatives. Although the recent decision to lay off 15,000 employees might seem concerning, it is part of a broader strategy to enhance operational efficiency and focus on core competencies, enabling Intel to adapt more effectively to evolving market demands. A key factor influencing Intel's future is the increasing global demand for semiconductors. As technology becomes more integrated into daily life, the need for high-performance chips continues to rise. Intel's resources and commitment to innovation position it to capture a larger share of this expanding market. Moreover, government support for the semiconductor industry adds another layer of potential upside for Intel. Given the strategic importance of semiconductor manufacturing in light of global supply chain challenges, particularly concerning the Taiwan-China situation, there is growing interest from government entities to bolster domestic semiconductor production. This focus on strengthening local supply chains can create favorable conditions for Intel, as it could receive both financial incentives and regulatory support to expand its operations and enhance its competitive positioning. Conclusion In summary, Intel Corporation is significantly undervalued based on its current P/NAV ratio. The company possesses strong assets, a history of innovation, and a strategic focus on future technologies. As Intel continues to execute its strategic plans and navigate market challenges, it has substantial potential to regain its competitive edge and achieve remarkable growth. Furthermore, the increasing government interest in supporting semiconductor manufacturing amid geopolitical uncertainties enhances Intel's prospects. The market's current valuation does not adequately reflect Intel's true value and growth potential, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

Long-time AMD Holder (Cost Basis 1904) Starting to Sell - Anyone Else Disappointed in the Stock in 2.csv,"Wrote about my thinking below... Out of the 31 large banks, 25 have a “buy” rating and 6 have a “hold” rating on AMD 0.29%↑. It’s hard to think about why to sell when everyone is telling you to buy, but I am of the opinion that is when it should be most deeply considered. image credit to tipranks.com AMD has been my most profitable investment of the past 5 years, having risen 800% since purchased in August of 2018. For most investors (including myself), it’s difficult to part with winners. Not only that, I am someone who believes AI will proliferate throughout society in the coming years. Because they design data center GPUs, AMD should be one of the primary beneficiaries as the AI boom continues. It might seem counter-intuitive then to sell the stock here, but that is what I’ve begun doing over the past two weeks. I had high hopes for AMD this year, but it’s my view that they've failed to take significant data center GPU market share from Nvidia, and will have increased competition from Intel's new product offerings (on both client and data center), as well as proprietary silicon from large cloud players (Google, Amazon, etc). My original thesis was that AMD would profit from overextended Nvidia margins in 2024, but this underestimated the CUDA ecosystem moat that existed with Nvidia data center products (see Why I Got Nvidia Wrong). While most large cloud players want to diversify at least somewhat from Nvidia, they are still unable to do so without risking a competitive advantage with their own AI offerings. Add Intel into the mix, and the margin and market share pressure will be on AMD. The only player in the silicon value chain I think which can currently raise margins is TSMC (TSM 2.61%↑), but the geopolitical risk is too high for me to continue holding the stock (I sold my TSMC stake two weeks ago). On the PC (personal computer), Nvidia has always had a strong moat. It’s not just because they have the best performing products, but also because game developers are economically incentivized to optimize first (and often only) for the largest potential audience. This is similar to the moat CUDA protects on the data center side. One might think that Nvidia charging incredibly high prices for discrete graphics cards would cause them to lose share to AMD with consumers who directly purchase the products (as opposed to businesses who purchase the data center products). Yet Nvidia market share has only grown over the past few years. Data from Jon Peddie Research Why This Take Could Be Wrong: There is a lot of bullish momentum in the investor community around AMD currently from both professional commentators and retail investors (e.g. Twitter / X). Many people who had never heard of AMD 5 years ago are now saying to put money into the stock as it is Nvidia’s only pure AI competitor. As a result of this, AMD could see a dramatic rise on a positive earnings report later this month. In addition, I expect gaming revenues to surprise to the upside with the minor refresh of Xbox and Playstation consoles coming for holiday season. I still have ~260 shares of AMD remaining, and will likely hold to see if the stock jumps on the report. I think that AMD is extremely stretched in its current valuation (P/E of 205), and that any bad news could send it spiralling. Selling half of the remaining stake now is essentially a hedge against this possibility. Whatever happens with the earnings report, I will likely reduce my AMD holdings to zero in the next few months as I continue to lower exposure to companies reliant on Taiwan.",0.5591,NEGATIVE,0.9976

Wells Fargo ($WFC) must face a lawsuit over sham job interviews Rate Cut Countdown — Will the Fed Finally Pull the Trigger? Nope, the Fed isn’t cutting rates this week. But don’t snooze just yet—this meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn’t overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy—he's searching for that ""just right"" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same. Inflation: Cooling Off Inflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year’s 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the ""last mile"" of inflation reduction. The message? We’re on the right track, folks. Unemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it’s taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell’s recent take? The labor market isn’t adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a “sweet spot”—balancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals. Risk Management Reboot With inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed’s risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle—slightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed’s past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they’re determined to act promptly to avoid a recession. Some Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it’s time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn’t seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first. The Fed’s balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31. McDonald’s: The Golden Arches Stumble By the Numbers Revenue: $6.49 billion (missed $6.61 billion estimate) Earnings per Share: $2.97 (missed $3.07 estimate) Same-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020) U.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7% International Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1% International Franchised Sales: Down 1.3% McDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening. Value Meals to the Rescue The fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn’t translated into higher overall sales just yet. Internationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk. Defying the Odds Announcing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away. Despite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a ""buy"" and none recommending a sell. Looking Forward The golden arches are taking a ""forensic approach"" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales. So, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future. On The Horizon Tomorrow Economic Data and Earnings This week is buzzing with key economic data, especially on the employment front.

Microsoft’s Cloud Rain on Earnings Parade In a classic case of “so close, yet so far,” Microsoft ($MSFT) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, only to see its stock plummet over 5.79% in after-hours trading. Why? Investors fixated on the company’s disappointing Azure cloud revenue. Earnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints Microsoft’s revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure’s performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue—just shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub’s impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn’t enough to quell investor concerns. By the Numbers Revenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected Market Reaction and Future Outlook While the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft’s other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure’s growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn’t enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft’s shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500’s 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market’s laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters. Chips Ahoy! AMD’s Data Center Sales Surge 115% AMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let’s break it down. Earnings Breakdown AMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street’s expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter AI Chips and Data Center Dominance The tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company’s overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast. Other Segments and Market Reaction While the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD’s business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year AMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high. On The Horizon Tomorrow’s labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let’s be honest, they’re all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week’s job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes. Before Market Open Boeing ($BA): Trouble in the skies and on the ground.

My Analysis on ARM Holdings 2 Trillion+ Valuation.csv,"I believe ARM Holdings is slept on! I believe it could be the next NVIDIA. As of this writing its Market Cap is sitting at $142.36 Billion. I believe that its market cap should be ATLEAST 1 trillion due to the fact that it has an enormous market share of damn near if not more of 95% of the worlds smart device chips. What makes ARM unique is its business model. Their primary source of revenue is from the leasing of the design of the instruction set of computer chips. For those who dont know the instruction set is often referred to as an instruction set architecture (ISA), is a group of commands for a CPU in machine language. These commands tell the processor what operations to perform. Each instruction in the set specifies a particular operation to be performed on a specified set of data operands. The instruction set is fundamental to the design and functionality of computer chips, dictating how software communicates with hardware... So what is unique about this? Well I will tell you, these instruction sets are incredibly energy effecient compared to what is used currently for AI such as RISC or X86 etc. Currently NVIDIA is soaring because of the AI craze and its success has put light onto AMD, INTEL, SMCI etc but I believe ARM is a sleeper in my opinion. Their main source on revenue is through the royalties it recieves for leasing its designs. They can easily raise the royalty rate to increase their revenue stream anytime but there are some downsides. There customers could leave them and use other options. I dont think that is going to happen because lets face it their intellectual property is far better than any of the competition in terms of effeciency. AI is growing rapidly and one key expense is going to be energy consumption. Especially in these data centers. To my knowledge most data centers run on chips that use x86 from Intel. Those chips using that instruction set uses alot of energy. I believe data centers are looking to convert to a more energy effecient chip and when they do.... ENTER: ARM. Arm is currently used in almost all smart devices because again they are energy effecient. Why do we have longer battery life in a smart phones? Its because of ARM. What chips do electric cars use? ARM what instruction set does your microwave, fridge, washing machine use? ARM. Currently ARM is all over the portable device market but once they hit the data centers I believe there revenue is going to explode and therefore the market cap. There are major catalysts going down right now such as Microsoft partnering with them to make ARM based laptops and NVIDIA collaborating with them to make computers, not to mention that Tesla ordered a ton of NVIDIA chips that use ARM architecture. But my most bullish thing about ARM is what Jensen Huang said at Computex. He said that AI will eventually become physical in terms of robotics. Do you think those robotics need a energy sucker of a computerchip instruction set? No, the need the most energy effecient tech in todays age and that where ARM steps up right again. Currently we only use AI remotely (Chat GPT, Picture Generators, Etc.) but once we put AI into something physical and tangible such as robots to do everyday tasks those devices and robots need to run on the most advance and effecient software. I am currently looking at an outlook of 5-15 years and I am long on my position is this stock. We all seen what nvidia did and can only imagine what the next stock can yield the same returns and I think its ARM Holdings. Imagine going back to 2017 and investing into NVIDIA when the markect cap was the same as ARM now. Those returns look nice right if you have invested then. The time is now. Please keep in mind that i have not decided to go completely in depth of all of my research on ARM Holdings so please do your own. Also, I purposefully did not go into fundementals such as earnings and revenue on this. This is just my personal long term outlook on the research I have done.

April 2024: I am now a reformed bear continuing bull strategy from the first 6 weeks: S*P drop 5.4% through April 19 - higher than expected inflation date. Push rates higher, lower # of anticipated rate cuts. I got hammered trying the same call strategy. Gave away 15k if not more. May 2024: AI AI AI every time you say AI in your earnings call the price goes up $1. S&P up 5.96% June 2024: News Report: tech doesn't even need a rate cut to continue the bull run. June 12 $AAPL says ""APPLE INTELLIGENCE"", reaches all time highs. (puts for their earnings btw). $NVDA 140% for the year? After last year we were like WTF how is this 300 a share let alone 1400 a share in June. July 2024 $GOOG $AMZN up ~80-100% for the year. Look, its logical to take profits. No shame in that especially for retail who loses out 90% of the time. July 2024: Rate cuts like 99.999% almost certain for sept. Now suddenly Small/Mid caps rally in a massive sector rotation. $SPX/$NDX tanks. Next week: 1T outflows. Then they pump and dump the russel up 12% to 2022 highs and then sell off for a quick 6% while everyones FOMOing into $RUT. Maybe more like RUT RO!!!! I Fomo'd last of dry powder MOnday but after earnings I'm turning bearish. Tomorrow 5k realized loss for me or hold to 0. Too hard to beat the street. Profit taking, buying million dollar real estate with cash like smart investors do. Sit on the sidelines and let it bleed. But here we are still FOMO'ing calls and short dated puts that would only print 1/1000 times. Over the past few days 3 mag 7 earnings all tanked and here we are. AMD? CPUs Good for gamers and graphics cards for poors. Pennies compared to $NVDA. $NVDA has a monopoly on AI software like $ASML has a monopoly on lithography and $TSM has a monopoly on chip production. $TSLA obviously seemingly doomed. Google can't take your cookies anymore, advertising revenue down MoM. Wanna get cucked by the zuck? I'm tempted to donate $1 to people wanting to buy $META calls at this point. TLDR: This looks like the same pattern we have had in 2022 and 2023 when markets take a downturn through mid-late October. Look at the previous years. I posted last week about the last 4 septembers being red. It looks like we are in another downturn. Earnings indicates it. I don't think CPI and PCE will save us this week. I'm scrounging up 25k waiting for the correction / dip / crash and buying SHARES so i never waste so much of my lifetime just to lose money speculating with options. Will post my realized losses if you think I'm BS. Thanks for reading this or just the TLDR. Looking forward to discussion!",0.5416,NEGATIVE,0.9998
My thesis on INTC going into 2025.csv,"I am going to add my technological and geopolitical fundamentals here, because I think these are going to be important factors heading into 2025. Disclaimer: I own 575 shares of Intel at an average PpS of $29.30 I think most analysts are forgetting that the next president is the same guy who is trying to block the acquisition of US steel by Nippon steel at all costs, regardless if it makes financial sense or not because he wants to retain as much American Manufacturing as possible and wants it to succeed. Most of the ""AI revolution"" has happened over the past 4 years where the administration had no problem letting foreign chip manufacturing take the lead. Intel is competing with TSMC, and TSMC receives massive subsidies and discounts from the Taiwanese government which dwarf the 7.9B (which was even reduced) from the US government. On top of that, the US government is also giving slightly less in subsidies, 6.6B, to TSMC to build in the US. So really, the current administration is not giving Intel an advantage over TSMC. The most effective thing that they could do is levy tariffs against Taiwan, which the next president has gone on record stating he wishes to do, instead of subsidies. This would increase demand for American chip manufacturing; while TSMC can manufacture in the US, CoWoS packaging is done outside of the US, in either Malaysia or Taiwan, and would cause the product to be subject to tariffs. In the chip design space, Intel is hopelessly behind on GPUs compared to Nvidia, and now Apple, Amazon, OpenAI and others are designing their own chips and using TSMC for manufacture. Intel still dominates the CPU space, but your average datacenter rack might have 10/20+ GPUs for each CPU. AMD is also a viable alternative to Intel for CPUs, and as such takes about 25% of the market. Intel's only way to compete in the GPU space is in the cost performance market, which mainly targets budget gaming, crypto mining, and cheap datacenter. The newest release of the ""Battlemage"" B580 is expected to compete with Nvidia's 4060 at the under $300 MSRP market, which are lofty goals. Nvidia and AMD still have offerings in these spaces but they are not lucrative ones. So Intel is basically competing to be a 3rd rate designer in the US, while they still have the CPU lead it matters a lot less for the lucrative markets right now. It's clear that on the design front, Intel is not going to receive much help to be successful. While this is their core business and majority of revenue, it is a business they are falling behind substantially compared to others. Design demand is GPUs and they are late to this party. Revenue for products is expected to stagnate or decline unless they have a competitive GPU offering. However, the US needs to have a domestic cutting edge chip manufacturing supply chain. It has expressed as much as a result of the 2022 supply chain shortage when we realized that letting TSMC manufacture 90% of the world's sub 5nm chips was a bad idea. That was the motivation behind passing the CHIPS act; Pat Gelsinger was instrumental in advising the current administration for this. The method for doing so has left a lot to be desired; Pat himself even expressed as much given the delay in fund disbursement, which in all fairness was only accelerated as a result of the election result and comments from republicans that they wanted to repeal the act. TSMC is not allowed to have the latest node fabricated in the US by law of the Taiwanese government. This is so that the country keeps its ""Silicon Shield"", the dependence globally to have manufacturing be done there which keeps Taiwan protected from China. But Intel has no such limitation. And TSMC is not able to fufill 100% of the orders for its customers; it is aggressively building more fabs to keep up with the ever increasing demand of AI. This demand exists for Intel to take part of. So, Intel in the next administration will have a tremendous amount of support for its Foundry, not Products, side of the business. This leaves Intel with a potential alternative to many of the scenarios analysts predict: It could solely dedicate to Foundry and sell off its Products division, most likely to AMD which shares the x86 architecture already and is solely focused on design. This would allow Intel to become a Foundry for external customers without having a conflict of interest, which I suspect is keeping them from customers. The CHIPS act stipulates that Intel has to retain a majority stake of Foundry but NOT Products, so this does not prevent Intel from dedicating itself to Foundry, which is what the US wants. I think Pat was waiting for the right climate to do this and it is coming soon. It is sad he did not stay long enough to see it happen. If Intel received the same amount of support from the US government that the Taiwanese government gave to TSMC, and was able to win external customers as a result of Tariffs, it could become the US TSMC. Much of this hinges on the 18A and later 14A nodes which are competitive with TSMC 2nm, which is the current cutting edge. But I think this is the desire of Intel and the next administration, and so they will work towards this goal. To diminish foundry would be a slow death for Intel. That is why I am still looking forward to Intel in 2025. If you got this far, thank you for reading. EDIT: Now that I think about it, it is also entirely possible for Qualcomm to buy Intel's Products division. I think they expressed as much earlier this year, but being they are primarily ARM I am not sure if it would be a good fit.",0.5359,NEGATIVE,0.9956
My views on why NVDA beats earnings and flies to higher supports Likley past 200.csv,"For the PE bitchers and moaners, I leave you this: AMD Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 126 NVDA Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 69 Chanos bitched and moaned all the way to the broke house where he had to close shop.

THAT BEING SAID, MARKET IS NO LONGER LOOKING FOR INSANE NUCLEAR GROWTH. BUT STEADY HEALTHY GROWTH. THAT** WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. Crazy AI nuclear growth, is not what the market is expecting. Market is expecting a healthy stable growth, now that we are near equilibrium with AI and chips, ( this is obviously not true, but it's the arguments bears try to hang on. They think Amazon will overtake a 30 year CUDA industry software environment the entire world/industry has created THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AROUND). Go look up CUDA. It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four... NVDA continues to climb on growth, steady healthy growth, not insane nuclear growth. THAT WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. It has no where else to go. Ive's and Wedbush, are ENTIRELY correct.

NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming Latest Sept 2025, with my guess, Jensen starts marketing from first half of 2025, and wider release commercially of NVDA CPU for 1st qtr of 2026, March, me thinks Jensen starts getting market ready all of 2025 for release in the wild September 2025 for retail user and full wider release by March 2026 / end of February 2026. Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?.. I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about.

Nearly every other chip designer abandoned fabs because businesses operate best when they focus on what they do best. Intel is unique in that it is set up to transform the business into a major foundry model going forward. That takes decades of investment which Intel is ahead on. One day, Intel may fabricate chips for Nvidia, AMD, Texas Instruments, Apple, Qualcomm, and Microsoft. This is due to their potential leadership in silicon photonics and quantum computing.

NVDA has been all the rage and justifiably so.csv,"Since NVDA reporter its Q1 2023 earnings, revealing huge demand for AI chips, the stock has surged to $3.3T. Revenues 4x, margins up expanded and everything seemed perfect. Bulls claimed the stock was getting cheaper to decelerating growth. Quarterly revenue growth has dropped from 88% to 34% to 18%, heading towards single digits. Next quarter we’ll see just 7%. All of the marginal buyers are in — sucking the last few retail buyers in with the lure of a split. History suggests short term bump after a split as we are seeing, but now institutional investors have a vast pool to distribute their shares in coming months. As the saying goes, “when the ducks are quacking, feed them.” If the quarterly revenue growth continues to moderate, earnings growth will be impacted as well — making the stock become more and more “expensive” (multiple screams higher) versus the theme of last year when the higher it climbed the “cheaper” it got. This does not change the fact that it is a great business with a great leader — which will play a role in the advance of AI technologies and productivity. It’s just going to be a heavy lift that it retains a perception of greater value than Amazon, Microsoft or the entire German Stock Market Capitalizations (where it trades now). NVDA is still a semiconductor company, which has never been a secular business — it’s cyclical. Always has been, always will be. As for 70% gross margins, as Bezos famously said, “your margin is my opportunity.” NVDA has not cured cancer. There will be more and more competition going forward. Intel’s Gaudi 3 is 50% faster than NVDA’s H100 and 40% more energy efficient. AMD is gunning for them. The game is just beginning and NVDA will be forced to share the pie as no buyer wants to be beholden to one company. NVDA is a great company and will continue to innovate.

We'll be bringing that late next year when Falcon Shores, when we combine the great systolic performance of Gaudi 3 with a fully programmable architecture and all of that comes together with Falcon Shores. And then we have a rich, a very aggressive cadence of Falcon Shores products following that. We also added the Gaudi 3 PC IE card to it, this use case of Xeon plus an accelerator or Gaudi accelerator is getting very good response from customers as well. So we'll be bringing that out later this year. But the real story is delivering the TCO value, delivering the enterprise use cases.

"NVDA will hit 5T market cap in 2026, and 10T market cap before 2032.csv","Hi regards, This is not a ""copium"" post about the recent stock price drops. I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest. The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY. First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"". Name Stock price EPS SP/EPS ratio AAPL 230 1,4 164 MSFT 413 2,95 140 AMD 145 0,16 1.035 META 516 5,16 100 AMZN 171 1,26 135 NVDA 116 0,68 170 As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price. But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list. AAPL Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits. How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new. But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more. MSFT They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are. They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy. They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office? AMD I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first. Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware. Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software. And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section. META They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value. ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS. AMZN The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL. NVDA AND OUR STAR CHILD. HOT TOPIC OF 2024. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company. Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?

I read and re-read the original Transformers paper over and over and over again until I understood every single word. Thats how I learn. Over and over, deeper and deeper, until it all clicks. I can see with 100% confidence that the technology underpinning LLMs is completely non-specific to any specific domain. We have just begun to harness this new power Inputs in. Predictions out. Past in. Future out. That's it. It can learn any and every pattern the world has. Compacting the information of the past into a machine that can predict the future. I don't know how big that opportunity is. But I know we will underestimate it. We always do. Unless you're von Neumann. This is obviously going to create a huge bubble. You can't have this kind of transformation without people getting overexcited for a few years. But we aren't at that stage yet. Look at how long the dotcom bubble took, and more importantly, look how the late stage was characterized - explosion of IPOs. Until we get a flood of IPOs, we aren't in the late stage. Until we see an IPO for SexRobots Inc, we aren't in the late stage. At the moment we've got a handful of companies beating expectations because of AI revenue (good for Nvidia, long-term), and some beating CapEx expectations because of AI spending (good for Nvidia, short-term) The current situation Look at Nvidia P/E compared to its share price. We're halfway through the year. At the end of this fiscal year, Nvidia will be worth $180 at the midline of this trend. It is currently $113. That is a 57% return, 157% on an annualized basis. Nvidia is down 17% from its peak. Its hard to call the bottom, but yesterday we saw a major flash crash followed by a v back up. Much like the opposite of the ""blow-off"" tops that we see when the bull runs peak. Big volume selling, big volume buying. Big down, big up. I expect the fast bears used that to get out. The slow ones will watch their profits start eroding before also bailing and taking their gains. The slower ones will hit their stop losses, and the slowest will drift back into the red. If you're a bear in the green, take the W and get out Upcoming catalysts Other company earnings next week - MSFT, META, SNAP, AMD, ARM Upcoming earnings What are the market expectations for next earnings? They say they are expecting $0.59 per share. But last quarter Nvidia made that, on the back of 26B in revenue. For this quarter, Nvidia predicted 28B revenue. If they hit that, we're looking at $0.66. But of course they're being conservative. Why wouldn't they? When your growth is 262% you have plenty of room to estimate conservatively. How conservative are they usually? Last time they predicted 24B and hit 26B. If roughly that amount extra happens again, we're looking at 30B in revenue and $0.70 in profit.

NVIDIA (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang Points to 1 Trillion Opportunity for the Company.csv,"Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the next few weeks until the US election would be “confusing” for many since no one could say anything with conviction about who is going to be in the White House. Lee said that the market is going to trade “well” into the upcoming Fed meeting where he expects “some” rate cuts amid the labor market needing support and positive inflation data. Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said: However, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive. For this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that a trillion dollars’ worth of general-purpose data centers will inevitably transition to accelerated computing. “We’re in a computer revolution,” Huang said, pointing out that the first wave of data center modernization is driven by generative AI, which he described as more than just a tool—it’s a skill. Huang also emphasized the need for “densification,” with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) aiming to make data centers more efficient by compressing them into smaller spaces. He discussed NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it. Nvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia. Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave. At Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range. Of course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.

Nvidia The only problem you're gonna have is that you didn't sell more.csv,"Introduction Alright, so Nvidia is crazy overvalued right now. Just check out its P/E ratio – it's sitting at a whopping 73.94. And that's not all. Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.55, and the price-to-sales ratio is over 42. These numbers are way above what you typically see for tech stocks and the semiconductor industry. There are two big reasons why Nvidia's stock might take a hit: growing competition and lowered margins. Growing Competition First off, the competition is heating up big time. 🔥 AMD's MI300 series is a beast, merging CPU and GPU on the same chip, which is great for performance and energy efficiency. This is super important for data centers and AI applications, and it could seriously cut into Nvidia's market share. AMD is coming in hot, and Nvidia might end up feeling the burn. Then you've got Intel with their Gaudi3 GPU, which is packing some serious performance and efficiency for AI and machine learning tasks. More people might start switching to Intel's GPUs, giving Nvidia a run for its money. Intel's Gaudi3 could be the ghost in Nvidia's machine👻 Lowered Margins Then there's Amazon, which is throwing its hat into the ring with custom GPUs for their EC2 instances. These GPUs are optimized for machine learning and AI, and they integrate perfectly with Amazon's cloud services. This seamless integration could mean less reliance on Nvidia's products, pushing Nvidia to cut prices to stay competitive. Lower prices mean lower margins, which isn't great for Nvidia's bottom line. Amazon could very well turn Nvidia's margins into margin call memes. 📉 Adding to the heat, TSMC is thinking about jacking up production fees for Nvidia. The chairman's plans to raise prices could eat away at Nvidia's margins even more. If TSMC hikes those fees, Nvidia might have to dig deeper into their pockets, and that could be a real pain in the margins. 💸 Link (06/04) So yeah, Nvidia's stock might be flying high right now, but with all this competition and pressure on margins, it might not stay that way for long. It's looking like Nvidia might be headed from tendies to tears if they can't keep up. 😂 TL;DR Nvidia is trading high, but AMD, Intel, and Amazon are bringing the heat. 🔥 Competition + TSMC price hikes = potential margin squeeze. Stock might go from 🚀 to 💥 if they don't keep up. 😂",0.5456,NEGATIVE,0.9812
Nvidia's Blackwell Delay Offers Investors A Chance To 'Add To Positions' says Goldman Sachs.csv,"Nvidia Corp (NVDA) finds itself at the center of tech speculation as reports have surfaced about potential delays in its much-anticipated Blackwell architecture. With tech giants like Nvidia often facing the heat of public and market scrutiny, the slightest hiccup can stir investor unease. But is this delay really a cause for concern, or just a blip on Nvidia’s otherwise smooth journey towards AI supremacy? According to a report by The Information, Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell chips might hit a speed bump, delaying their release by over three months due to alleged design flaws. These chips were set to ship later this year, boasting promises of up to 30x better Inference performance over their predecessors. Despite this setback, Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs advises investors to remain calm and continue with their current strategies. The delay, while not ideal, is unlikely to impact Nvidia's 2025 earnings power or its market dominance, according to Hari. “We expect there to be little to no impact on CY2025 earnings and, most importantly, the company's long-term competitive position.” Hari believes that any short-term volatility in Nvidia's fundamentals will be just that—short-lived. The Market Reaction: Opportunity or Overreaction? For those ready to jump ship, Hari's advice is clear: stay the course. Nvidia's stock might experience some turbulence, but the company’s strong footing in the AI market isn't going anywhere. “We would consider any near-term dislocation in the stock as an opportunity to add to positions.” Despite a recent 15% correction, Nvidia remains a top pick, firmly seated on Goldman's Americas Conviction List with a 12-month price target of $135, suggesting a potential upside of nearly 26%. Even with Blackwell’s reported delays, Nvidia’s projected 39% year-over-year growth in 2025 remains unchanged. Hari’s bullish stance is rooted in Nvidia’s role as a crucial player in the rapidly evolving AI sector, especially as the demand for advanced AI infrastructure shows no signs of slowing down. Implications for Rival – AMD Interestingly, while the Blackwell delays might appear as a dark cloud over Nvidia, there could be a silver lining for competitors like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (AMD). “We believe the market could perceive this development as a marginal positive for AMD — the only alternative to Nvidia today in Data Center GPUs.” Although the analysts say AMD is unlikely to overtake Nvidia due to Nvidia’s strong market position and AMD’s challenges in scaling operations, this situation could still present a competitive boost for AMD. What’s Next for Nvidia? In the tech world, where speed and innovation reign supreme, a three-month delay might seem significant. However, Nvidia’s legacy of innovation and market leadership paints a different picture. As Hari points out, “any impact to CY2025 earnings will be negligible,” and the temporary setback should not deter investors from seeing Nvidia’s long-term value. For now, Nvidia’s strategy remains rock solid. The potential delay, whether factual or exaggerated, is but a temporary hurdle, according to Hari. As Nvidia navigates this challenge, the market watches closely, with many investors seeing a buying opportunity amid the noise. For those invested in Nvidia's future, Hari’s message is clear: hold steady, as the AI revolution waits for no one.",0.5505,NEGATIVE,0.9994
NVIDIA's share price surge and the outlook for the AI arithmetic market bubble risk and rational lay.csv,"As NVIDIA's share price has risen sharply in the short term, many have begun to wonder if the industry is facing a turning point or if there is a bubble. From the perspective of the industry giants, GPUs, as representatives of A1 arithmetic chips, are currently far from meeting demand. We can assume that AI applications are still only in their infancy, and there has not yet been a particularly prominent Al burst application in the world. Analyse the results: The AI market is still at an early stage: AI applications, despite explosive growth in recent years, are still at an early stage. The arithmetic power required for current AI applications (e.g., big language modelling, autonomous driving, robotics, etc.), especially GPUs, is still in the pre-burst stage. The growth of Tesla and the robotics industry, for example, predicts that billions of robots will be needed in the future for arithmetic support. This means that there is a huge potential for growth in AI arithmetic demand over the next few years, especially in inferential computing. GPUs as core hardware for AI: GPUs play a key role in AI inference computing, especially in tasks that require high parallel processing power (e.g., deep learning inference, autonomous driving, robot control, etc.). Although there are already many GPU products on the market, overall, the demand for AI computing power is still in a state of oversupply, and the size of the AI computing power market is likely to continue to expand, especially in the ‘reasoning’ segment of the demand for this segment is the area of high computation, especially in the field of automated driving, cloud computing and so on. Personal view: NVIDIA's leadership in the GPU space is well recognised, but many are beginning to worry about an industry bubble due to the short-term surge in its share price. NVIDIA's dominant position: Currently, NVIDIA is the almost unrivalled leader in the field of AI hardware (especially GPUs), and its products are widely used in AI training and reasoning calculations, especially playing a central role in large-scale data centres and cloud services. NVIDIA's rising share price reflects investors' optimistic expectations about the potential of the AI market. Bubble Risk: As NVIDIA's share price has surged, the market has become sceptical about whether it is overvalued. NVIDIA's high valuation could lead to the formation of a bubble, especially if its products and technologies are not sufficiently digested by the market. While the AI industry is promising, the market is volatile in the short term and the rise of competitors (e.g. AMD) could change the market landscape. Therefore, investors and industry observers need to be wary of market overheating and short-term speculation. Core view: US tech giants (e.g. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook) are supportive of NVIDIA's technology, but they will also support NVIDIA's competitors, such as AMD, in order to avoid the arithmetic market being monopolised by one company and to ensure the sustainable development of the industry. Analyse the results: Rational rather than short-term profit-driven: the behaviour of these tech giants suggests that they are not simply pursuing short-term profit when purchasing AI arithmetic, but are planning the security and sustainability of their own development in the long term. By supporting competitors such as AMD, these companies avoid the risk of the market becoming too dependent on NVIDIA alone, ensuring diversity in market competition and technological innovation. This kind of rational decision-making is crucial to the healthy development of the AI hardware market. If NVIDIA dominates the AI arithmetic market without competitive pressure, it could lead to overpricing, affecting the interests of other tech giants. As a result, companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon prefer to ensure diversity and healthy competition in the AI arithmetic market by supporting competitors such as AMD. In summary: future outlook and risks Huge potential for AI arithmetic: The demand for AI arithmetic is far from reaching its ceiling, especially in the area of inferential computing, and the market demand for GPUs will continue to grow as robotics and autonomous driving technologies evolve. The adoption of AI technologies will generate even more demand for arithmetic power in the coming decades, especially in emerging technologies such as robotics and autonomous driving. NVIDIA's dominance and risks: While NVIDIA's dominance in the AI hardware space cannot be ignored, the sharp rise in its share price and high market valuation have raised concerns about the existence of a bubble. Future technological competition, especially the rise of competitors such as AMD, may affect NVIDIA's market share. Long-term layout of industry giants: U.S. tech giants are very rational when investing in AI arithmetic, they will not simply pursue short-term benefits, but pay more attention to the diversity of the arithmetic market and the sustainability of the technology, to ensure that they can be invincible in the competition in the coming years. The AI arithmetic market is full of great potential, but is still in the early stages of development. While NVIDIA occupies a leading position in the AI hardware market, its high valuation and share price volatility also make the risk of a bubble",0.5575,POSITIVE,0.7135
NVIDIA’s next catalyst has to be sovereign AI.csv,"NVIDIA’s current valuation is not overtly expensive (FPER: 33, PEG: 1.61 according to FINVIZ) and the GPU orders for next year are all booked. Yet the stock is meeting strong resistance around $130. I think this is partially because a lot of people have been burned by CISCO during dot-com bubble and do not want to price in the future too much. But the real concern is that their revenue is almost entirely dependent on the rest of M7 and they are charging the big tech 80 % margin. The big tech, while being hammered by Wall Street for the increased CAPEX spending, indicated during last earning that they will not reduce their investment on AI. However, they did mention that they are/plan using their NPU (Google TPU, Tesla Dojo, AMD) to reduce the usage of NVIDIA GPU. Furthermore, GPT5 and Apple Intelligence should be available to the public by the end of this year. If these do not impress, the entire AI sector may see significant slowdown. But if GPT5 shows plateauing of performance while people find Apple Intelligence interesting, paradigm could shift toward smaller models and inference efficiency, again reducing the demand for NVIDIA. To justify significant increase in NVIDIA’s stock price, they need to show that they are not entirely dependent on the Big Tech. The only other potential buyers that have as much buying power are governments. Also, if the economy is going through downturns, governments have excuse to increase their spending. What I am paying attention to during the earning call is demonstration from NVIDIA that they are receiving significant demand from non-Big Tech such as governments.",0.5529,NEGATIVE,0.9994

Short Call Strategy Am I Regarded or Might This Actually Work.csv,"Okay, so I'm guessing a good amount of us in this subreddit were new to options trading at some point in time, and when we were just itty bitty option noobs first hearing about them, we just thought: "" Wow! this is just the same thing as betting on stocks but with leverage right?"" (might just be me when I first got into options trading but whatever). Moving on. I assume that many people's first instinct was to go and buy a call on a stock they were very bullish on. And I would assume that once we did that, we lost the entire position because we never knew how theta decay, IV, DTE, strike price, and other factors could sink your entire position. The thing about these factors is that when you buy a call, the majority of these factors are stacked against you, and if you don't want them to be completely stacked against you, you gotta pay up for a higher premium which is gonna yield the same or less of a return then the lower priced (but considerably more risky) options. You're paying for less risk. Long Calls are usually only profitable when the underlying has a significant enough uptick to outweigh all the other factors dragging down the value of the option. I'm sorry I don't mean to repeat the basics of valuing options but I think it's important to pretext them a little bit so my strategy makes more sense in the grand scheme of things. Okay, so my strategy is as follows: why buy a call, and have all of these factors stacked against you, when you can sell one, and have them work in your favor; I guess the whole basis is: the shittier the call, the better (meaning how likely it is to expire or be exercised with no value). The even better thing is we can magnify the shittiness to work in our favor on the sell side by selling balls deep out of the money calls, with low IV, and few DTE. And we can magnify this even further by selling calls on options with really shitty stocks underlying; stocks that are down 40% YTD, or just really, really stagnant not moving anywhere (might also get some sexy low IV to work in your favor there too). I don't really have any stocks in mind right now to lock this trade in off the top of my head, but $NOC and $AMD are quite down this last month and a half, and are relatively popular stocks. Like I said I need to find some better stocks for this Strat; these are not the ones I wanna go with, just what I thought of off the top of my head Now you might be saying two things: 1. ""The prices on them are probably gonna be pennies on the dollar. Sure the odds might be in your favor, but the yield is gonna be very low"", and 2. ""What fucking moron is gonna be stupid enough to buy these calls?"". To answer question 1: Why not just sell more calls? And to answer question 2: I don't think I need to illustrate the stupidity of individuals in the market, but if you need me to, here you go: WSB regards (not dissing, I am also a WSB regard who has lost thousands on YOLOs), teenagers with a Robinhood account that just found out about options, and maybe even people who are legit investors, but have bought the call as a part of some bigger options play, like a straddle, or iron condor (not to mention that in the example of the straddle, I don't think they would really give a shit if the call tanked because, well, it's a straddle lol, the put on the other side would cover the losses and make profit{and yeah there are probably more plays where this is the case that I am just forgetting about, but this is the example I'm just gonna go with for now}). Not to mention markets are huge and I've checked the open interest on some of these calls and there are hundreds going up to the thousands in open interest on balls deep OTM, 2DTE, Low IV call options. Anyways, I guess the reason I made this post is to double check with some options veteran (I've been into options for a little less than a year, but I have some knowledge on them from my job) to see if this strategy is complete delusional manic retardation, or if there is actually some substance to it. I wanna make sure there isn't some variable or factor I'm not accounting for that could tank this entire play. If anyone could let me know, that would be much appreciated, thanks.",0.5298,NEGATIVE,0.9997

SMCI 1 day later.csv,"Hello fellow regards, Yesterday i had made a post on this subreddit about how SMCI is an undervalued stock, and that it is heavily involved in the future of AI, due to them supplying server systems to big companies such as AMD and Nvidia. I had also stated that the stock is undervalued, however, even though the stock had skyrocketed 12.5% today, i still strongly believe that the stock is still undervalued at $875 as it hit $960 a month ago and $1229 around march. The company also had stated that they want to supply 1000 liquid cooling racks per month, and increase their 1% market share to 15% within the next 12 months. This means that the stock has a lot of room for growth and i firmly believe that it can reach a market cap of $75 billion after its next ER, which would make the share price at around $1300. I am currently holding 10 shares right now, which is down from my 20 shares from yesterday as i had sold at $880. However, if it dips, i may buy more shares, but if it continues to rally, then i may hold onto the 10 shares i have as of right now.",0.5837,NEGATIVE,0.972

SMCI loose analysis and opportunity simmering.csv,"SMCI golden age and beautiful chart. After hours Friday SMCI jumped almost 9 percent! Makes perfect sense that investors are flooding back into this stock! It has been so beaten down over the last six months by bad press and fears of fraud. Those fears have been quelled by a new CFO and auditing team. We just saw in the last month of 72% rally and there is still plenty of room to run on Monday it will open up around $48, the last critical level we saw was $49. Also, it looks like a somewhat sloppy cup and handle pattern is forming. My half baked technical analysis is. We will see a minor pull back around $50 to finish the pattern, then it will launch back up to the next critical level around $60 a share. Fundamentally speaking, they have been showing plenty of growth and demand for their products which mainly consists of hardware to House semiconductors, especially their trademark marked water cooled rack, which directly addresses a huge issue that centers are facing as computing power gets to Skynet levels. Their price to earnings ratio is a modest 21.9, the earnings per share is a humble 2, the ps ratio is 1.5 which is the lowest among its competitors. In fact all of its metrics or lowest amongst its competitors except for the EPS for AMD, which is 1.1. There will be much to see within the next quarterly earnings report and how they managed to address their auditing issues and reporting issues. But I think this company still has room to run and definitely has legs. I have 200 shares with plans to buy much more. I was going to buy on the next red day, expecting it to be Monday, but I digress. Next pull back I’m buying calls with a strike price of about $49-$55 exp in March. Even considering a YOLO.

"SMCI will skyrocket soon, DONT MISS OUT!.csv","So currently SMCI is around the $840 to $850 levels but hit $775 on monday. This meant that there is still a chance to buy SMCI while the shares are cheap right before they release their earnings in a month. The reason why im bullish on SMCI is because AI is driving the stock to skyrocket as they work alongside Nvidia and AMD in providing data centres. Elon musk had also catapulted the stock to reach over $1000 as he had tweeted that he is partnering with Dell and SMCI to provide AI data centres for its generative AI chatbot. https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/super-micro-computer-ceo-post-picuture-with-elon-musk-at-ai-data-center-432SI-3505317 As a result of this, SMCI will most likely smash their earnings report of $8.10 per share in early august and hopefully make the stock reach above $1100, which is a 30% increase from what the share price is today.

Strong AI and Semiconductor weeks ahead.csv,"Hi all, I think that AI and esp. Semiconductor Stocks have a couple of strong weeks ahead. Starting on Tuesday, October 15th 2024, the Open Compute Project (OCP) global summit takes place in San Jose, California. Between 9 AM and 11:30 AM there'll be short keynotes (each 12 mins) presented by Meta, NVidia, AI Clusters, Intel, AMD, Microsoft and Google (full schedule here). Now, I don't think that there'll be any big surprises. But the Summit still presents an opportunity for public remarks about how strong the demand is or what so ever. Also, there's an article that says that Broadcom (AVGO) is going to show case cutting-edge AI infrastructure. Further it is expected that Taiwan Semiconductor Company (TSM) and ASML Holding (ASML) will publish their Q3 earnings next week. TSM will present its earnings on October 17th 2024 at 14:00 Taiwan time / 02:00 Eastern Time. So pre-market movements will most likely be wild on Thursday as a large part of the industry relies on TSM. If TSM reports a great Q3 revenue, this could push Nvidia over the current all time high. Also according to Moore's law is dead, the first RTX 5000 series GPUs are ready to be sold, but are not released because of business reasons (here at 22:22). So they could still change their mind and ship in Q4. Next, it is rumored (by moore's law is dead) that AMD will release a new CPU by the end of October or early November, the 9800X3D which is an 8 Core Gaming CPU with 3D cache and it is expected that it will be the fastest gaming CPU releasing this year. Although Client is not as important for AMD, it will still be beneficial to have this CPU released before the holiday season. Especially since Zen5 Rysen has so far been viewed as rather disappointing. Moore's law is dead also mentions an RX 7650 GRE GPU, which could launch alongside Ryzen 9800X3D. Releasing a slightly refreshed and cheap RDNA3 GPU could be a good move by AMD to get rid of RDNA3 stock ahead of the RDNA4 launch in 2025. Since the Ryzen 9800X3D has not yet been anounced, I don't think that it has been priced in and could give the stock a slight boost to recover from the -4% last Thursday. Also, I although Investors were not excited about AMDs Advancing AI event, I think AMDs position in the market is still solid. According to the slides shown at the event, AMD Epic has increased its market share to 34%. And according to tests AMD Epyc Turin obliterates Xeon 6 Granite Rapids, while being cheaper. Because of this, I think AMD is in a good position to gain more server market share. Further, the news about Nvidia Blackwell being sold out for the next 12 Months is not only good news for Nvidia but also for AMD. Sure, everyone wants blackwell. but if one can't get blackwell and if AMD Instinct MI325X is faster than Nvidia Hopper (H200), then they might be able to win over customers from nvidia, who would like to buy blackwell but can't in due time. Also, AMDs earnings should be reported on October 29 2024. Due to Ryzen Zen5 being disappointing and there being apparently a large RDNA3 stock remaining. If AMDs Instinct systems are selling well, this would also be good news for Micron Industries (MU), which produces high bandwith memory (HBM3e). And then there's Intel. Their newest releases seem to have been disappointing. But they claim to be making progress with their foundries.

They are frequently gamers, so they need to buy NVDA GPUs and AMD CPUs. They often buy these at AMZN. They buy YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, so they can skip the ads of their fellow influencers (GOOGL) They spent most of their waking hours at META's Instagram website. They drive a TSLA or RIVN. They're on the GLP-1 drug (LLY) to impress their SOs. They're churning their credit cards with AXP Platinum and Gold, JPM's Chase Sapphire Preffered (no, NOT Reserve), some younger ones need to rely on COF's Venture and Venture X cards that gave nice ""subs"". They use these cards frequently to eat out and earn those points at CMG, SHAK and SG. They're flying a lot on DAL, and they need their free wifi that is often sponsored by their preferred choice of mobile carrier, TMUS. To get to the airport they need to use UBER or LYFT, since they don't want to drive their sweet electric ride. When they arrive at their destination airport, they pick up their rental car, and of course they prefer AVIS (CAR), but their credit cards give them presential circle status on HTZ, so they are ok with that too. They check into their hotel room at Marriott (MAR) to impress their friends, but really they are using all their Chase points to book Hyatt (H) hotels. The slightly less premium young ones will have to go Hilton (HLT) and fly on UAL. They often booked all this travel on EXPE or BKNG. Sometimes they use ABNB. When they check in they need to get some food, so they use their DASH gift card they bought at COST every two weeks because they get 20% off. When they go to Vegas, they prefer to stay in WYNN, because it's where all the hot ones stay. After they're done with their holidaying which they do basically 4 months out of the year, they're going to ULTA or LULU to buy their beauty products or Khakis. They are drop shipping on SHOP and sometimes they need to use ZM to conduct ""business"" for their ""coaching classes"" that they teach. A lot of times they get paid using Venmo (PYPL).

"The next tech giant Why HOOD, PLTR and DKNG are the investment opportunities of a lifetime (Part 1).csv","I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong. $AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice. $NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were. And so in true wsb fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB. There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long. From a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about. And so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry : If you are under 40 years old, $HOOD (Finance), $PLTR (Defense) and $DKNG (gambling) will 100x during your investment horizon.

The short report for Intel (INTC) - A rabbit hole of CPU failures rate since 2022.csv,"Forenote: Im a technical person, A developer, this will be a technical DD to show how intel is failing to do their basic business model of manufacturing CPUs. Over the past month or so Intels customers have been becoming increasing irrate about CPUs just flat out dying after various finger pointing from Intel being debunked. I first caught wind of intels failures when a friends system started to become unstable, he would crash in games and sometimes doing mundane tasks. It all came to a clicking point when his systems files started becoming corrupted and he needed to attempt reinstalling windows. The attempts failed, windows couldnt even install without corrupted files, sometimes it would install and look fine, but running a verification shows that various system files were still corrupted but not important enough for the system to boot successfully. He would still get various crashes doing mundane things and gaming. It was basically a working brick at this point. So i got my research hat on, and discovered various reddit users on r/pcmasterrace were also reporting instability with their PCs. Not alot tho, this has been the wierd thing, Intel has such a large CPU failure rate, but not alot of reports which caught everyone by suprise. It started to make sense, the causes of the crashes were different for everything. Users were reporting issues with Nvidia, Issues with RAM, and issues with corrupted data. Obviously to any layman, these issues dont instantly point to an issue with the CPU. With GPU errors, Nvidia initially got heat, but Nvidia quickly debunked the issue reporting the GPUs that were returned were fully functional and had no issues. So I pulled out my handy dandy debug tools since my friend managed to get windows installed and it kinda runs. The first tests I ran were memory block verification. This validates that the memory is able to hold data immutably, after 4 hours the tests finished all green, the memory was stable and wasnt corrupting data. (its worth noting that the memory test software I used was very CPU lite so the CPU has little chance to corrupt the data its self, this is a stark difference to the Drive tests I ran.). Since my friend was getting corrupted files almost everytime he install anything, I ran the disk debug tools, these pull the S.M.A.R.T data from the drive and run various read and write tests. The S.M.A.R.T data came back green, the drive was reporting it had no errors or irregularies and was functioning fine, So i moved to the read and write tests, all red, the drive had a 90% file currption rate, I pulled the S.M.A.R.T data again, All green, the drive was still reporting it was functioning correctly. At this point, anyone would deduce they had a bad drive that was misbehaving, leading to the decreased number of CPU failure reports. After all, How can you say the CPU is bad when you have corrupt files? Many people forget how much the CPU is responsable for. When you read files or write files, its the CPU that tells the Drive what to store and where and what to read and where it is on the disk to read it from. and as i said, the software I used to test the drives is CPU intensive, it uses the the CPU to generate random data to store on the drive and hashes that data to verify it. So a bad CPU = Currupted data on the drive. Luckly my friend has 4 drives, So I told him to take out the ""bad"" drive and put in another one, I ran all my tests again and same result, the drive was reporting it was functional, but all the data was corrupted. The result was the same with all the drives tested. Now, this is a luxary many people dont have. Many people would get corrupted data on their drive and think the drive is dying and get a new one. However with 4 tests samples all failing the same way when days ago they were all fine is a very low chance. Now for the kicker, Intel has a tool to verify that the Intel CPU you have is a genuine Intel CPU, I guess intel has a problem of china making fake intel CPUs??? Ive never seen any but what the hell, its a useful tools since its does some basic CPU level checks. So i ran the verifier tool and its first test for a genuine CPU comes back green, Cool, it is a real Intel CPU. Memory test comes back green (We alreadt tested this soo good), next was the Graphics tests. Failed, the CPU was attempting to send data to the GPU and it corrupted the GPU memory. So now we have 2 symptoms. Disk data corruption GPU memory corruption My friend has Nvidia GPU and Nvidia previously debunked any issues with their GPUs. But we have a common cause, Intel CPUs are corrupting data when sending it to another device in the system (except RAM), Data sent to a disk gets corrupted and data sent to the GPU gets corrupted, which would explain the game crashes. Various other tests passed from boost speed changing, Wifi tests and math operations. After I finished all the tests and determed the issue is with the CPU, my friend RMA'd the CPU. This is where more troubles start. Intel refused the RMA, citing user damage, According to intel all the issues my friend was having was his fault and he caused the damage, After it was refused, I filed the RMA for him, to the same response, but because im a stickler I pushed for more info, Intel was refusing the RMA because of overclocking done by the motherboard. This is a previous blame game intel played, they were blaming Motherboards for putting in stock overclocks on CPUs causing them to fail, but this wasnt the case with my friend, his motherboard wasnt even stock overclocked, but intel refused it anyway. After this point is when the waterfall started coming down, a advanced tech-youtuber posted an exposé about intels CPU failures. See: Intel has a HUGE problem - Level1Tech the curtains were starting to fall, Apparently Game developers and datacenters (Intels BIGGEST customers) were getting large amounts of CPU failures specificly with intel CPUs. Now datacenters are normally quiet about this type of thing, opting to sort their issues directly with intel, but intel is turning away datacenters RMA's of thousands of CPUs, these datacenters has since publicly reported they are dropping intel systems from their products and only supporting AMD systems from now on. Intel has lost their largest customer base, because of their defective products and refusing to take responsability for the product inherit flaw. Intel is hoping this goes unnoticed, since reports are still low of CPUs failing because the errors are random and different each time and users dont know their CPU is defective, there isnt a big in your face ""The Intel CPU in this system has errored"" its always an error with something else, which is caused by the CPU. So intel is betting on customers blaming other manufactures like they did with Nvidia when this all started. Timeline of events: [Dec 2022] The first instances of ""Out of Video Memory"" issues on 13th Gen Core i9 CPUs were reported back in 2022. (Source: Reddit).

Edit: Ive received internal leaks from Intel employees explaining internal issues and intels failures. Source 1: The leading theory inside Intel right now, and it is just a theory, is that the Ring Bus is getting cooked because it's fed by the same rail as the P-Cores and E-Cores. Raptor Lake required incredibly high voltages that the clocks required to be competitive with Zen 4, and it seems like it was just pushed too hard. This is an inherent flaw that would be in Bartlett too it's overvolted. Meteor Lake isn't affected, and Emerald Rapids is unlikely be effected materially. Source 2: I never worked directly on Raptor Lake [Intel Design Engineer], but I did have exposure to Alder Lake, and I can confirm that they were very concerned about the ring bus getting damaged if the voltage was pushed too high. I can also confirm that Raptor Lake was rushed through the design and validation process... Source 3: I [Intel Foundry Services] can tell you that Raptor Lake was rushed through our Fab in Arizona in record time, but it's also produced in other fabs. However, this location (Arizona) is notable because I can confirm that there was an Oxidation issue caused by some failure in our HVAC system between March & June of 2023. It was so bad that Keyvan Esfarjani had to fly in to make decision about which wafers (which cost as much as a Model X each) needed to be thrown away. To be clear, I don't know what decision was made, but I do know that this event DID happen. And by the way, it affected Sapphire Rapids yields as well...although I doubt it's an issue that wasn't",0.5221,NEGATIVE,0.9929

Yes while the main points of the short report were not mentioned and intel continues to hide this infomation from Investors, they cant ignore the impact it has on their bottom line. RMA's are not cheap and the amount of money and time they are spending to fix the issue for existing chips while trying their hardest to deny RMAs for failed CPUs. Customers have lost faith in Intel, their chips are constantly beaten by AMD offerings and having a high failure rate really was the last nail in the coffin. Enterprise customers are switching, gamers are switching, datacetners are switching. All switching to AMD (or Arm - Yes Arm is starting to see some enterprise deployments, very little tho.) Intel will continue to have bad earnings for the forseable future (as they guided), And they also havnt announced (and likly wont) the delay of their next gen CPUs (15000 series) for desktop, they are expected to announce only Mobile chips and act like Desktop and server CPUs dont exist this generation.

VSH - The Forgotten King of Chips.csv,"TLDR: $VSH (Vishay Intertechnology) is printing money while everyone sleeps on it. $VSH just got the stamp of approval from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, confirming it as a hidden winner in Nvidia’s AI and RTX 50 supply chain. With key wins in MOSFETs, capacitors, and resistors, $VSH is now primed for explosive growth, riding Nvidia’s dominance in AI servers and GPUs. If you’re not jacked up on $VSH, you’re not meant to have money. Who is $VSH? Vishay Intertechnology is a veteran in the electronics industry. They make essential components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and semiconductors. You know, the boring stuff that makes your GPU, PS5, and electric toothbrush actually work. They’ve been doing this since 1962. That’s right, this company has survived every market downturn, bubble, and chip shortage in the last 60+ years. Meanwhile, you can’t even survive a red day on SPY. Why $VSH is printing money: Chips are everywhere—cars, phones, smart homes, AI servers. The global semiconductor market is growing at an insane pace (projected $1 trillion market by 2030). Guess what? Vishay is supplying the guts. Look at their P/E ratio: 12.5 (as of last check). Compare that to Nvidia’s 75+ or AMD’s 30-ish. $VSH is practically trading at the bargain bin, and yet their revenues are consistently strong. Vishay’s last earnings report crushed expectations, with double-digit growth in several segments. They’re sitting on $3.4B in annual revenue with plans to scale. Oh, and they’re buying back shares like they’re on clearance at Costco. Everyone’s hyped about Nvidia because of AI. Guess what? Vishay supplies components used in AI hardware, EV charging stations, and industrial automation. While Nvidia makes the sexy GPUs, Vishay sells the boring but essential resistors and capacitors that keep those GPUs from melting your motherboard. They’re eating up the market share. Recent Catalysts: Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo dropped a bombshell: Vishay is a key supplier for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI servers (GB200 series, DGX/HGX B200) and the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. These are Nvidia’s future bread-and-butter products, dominating AI and high-end gaming. Vishay replaced Infineon as Nvidia’s MOSFET supplier. Yes, Infineon, the semiconductor giant, just got sidelined. This Is MASSIVE for $VSH. Vishay is providing MOSFET/DrMOS (VRPower), vPolyTan (Polymer Tantalum Capacitors), and Current Shunt Resistors. These components are critical for Nvidia’s most cutting-edge products: • GB200 series AI servers: Nvidia’s next-gen AI infrastructure. • RTX 50 series GPUs: The next flagship graphics cards. Vishay’s vPolyTan capacitors (especially the T55 series) are already facing a supply crunch for 2025. That’s how in-demand they are. Kuo estimates that Vishay’s MOSFET production alone will contribute 20%-30% of revenue by 2025—with above-average gross profit margins. The vPolyTan capacitors will add a high single-digit percentage of revenue with significantly above-average margins. Translation? Vishay is printing money. Vishay’s production lines are already at capacity through 2025. When your biggest challenge is meeting demand, you’re in a good spot. Beyond Nvidia, Vishay is also poised to benefit from: • Automotive rebound: As EV production scales, Vishay’s components are critical. • IoT growth: Billions of devices mean billions of tiny components. Vishay is at the center of it. The Stock Is Still Cheap Even after today’s 7% jump to $18.35, $VSH is wildly undervalued. As I said earlier, the P/E ratio is still around 12-13, compared to Nvidia’s 75+. This is a company with real earnings, real dividends, and real growth potential. This is a great opportunity to make back everything you lost from your MSTR calls. Positions: Shares, 01/17/25 20C",0.5352,POSITIVE,0.9824

"Weekly jobless claims fall to 233,000, less than expected, in a positive sign for labor market.csv","Last night, the U.S. announced that the number of initial unemployment claims for last week was 233,000, significantly lower than the previous week's 249,000 and also below the market's expectation of 240,000! A few days ago, Mr. Wang mentioned that for the U.S. stock market to stop declining, the economic and labor data released must continue to be strong in order to ease concerns about a potential economic recession. Yesterday's sharp drop in initial unemployment claims marked the largest decrease in a year, indicating that the number of people recently unemployed has decreased. This alleviated the recession concerns raised by last Friday's non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate data, spurring a rally in U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 index surging over 2.3%, the largest single-day gain in 21 months 📈. On the other hand, the demand for the 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds at the auctions over the past two days was poor, causing the 10-year yield to exceed 4% once again! Tech giants saw a broad rebound, with Meta rising 4.2%, Alphabet up 1.9%, Amazon gaining 1.8%, Apple increasing 1.6%, and Microsoft rebounding 1%. Nvidia surged over 6%, returning to the $100 mark, leading to a rebound in semiconductor stocks. Broadcom, Micron, and Applied Materials all jumped more than 6%, while Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and AMD all saw gains of over 5%! Taiwan's ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) also rebounded, with TSMC and UMC both jumping more than 6%, and ASE gaining over 4%. However, it's still important to note that the number of continuing unemployment claims is rising, reaching its highest level since November 2021, nearly three years ago! Therefore, Wall Street's foreign investors remain concerned about the economy. For example, JPMorgan still believes the U.S. economy will enter a recession, raising the probability from 25% to 35%!

Why I am going long on Intel and letting Bad Daddy Gelsinger take me to Uranus - DD TurboNerd Post.csv,"TLDR: This stock fucking sucks, and I love it. But the developing foundry business is gonna get absolutely bananas under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for the sole purpose of developing it. They are not gonna let the other chip companies continue to take nut shots on them and they are just gonna make everyone chips for them. Anyways I all in on Mar 2025 Calls (which are like $4.50 - $5.00) right now. Here is some DD. Dog of the Dow Intel has lagged behind other chip titans such as [[AMD - AMD]] and [[NVDA -NVIDIA]] as they race to design and build chips to handle [[AI]] workloads. Both AMD and NVIDA have seen tremendous growth over the past 18 months (as of June 2024). A growth pattern that has gone completely unanswered by INTEL up until this point. Looking at the [[Price to Earnings Ratio]] of both AMD and NVIDIA it is easy to see how disconnected from earnings they have become (though they are both incredibly profitable). AMD P/E Ratio: 67.30 NVIDIA P/E Ratio: 238.53 INTEL P/E Ratio 31.79 AMD is wildly inflated relative to its competition in the space. NVDA is has a more ""sane"" price to earnings but it has also been nearly printing its own money with the amount of sales it has been making. The price of NVIDIA still ""feels"" high despite it's recent split. Another interesting metric to take a look at is the [[Price/Tangible Book]] - Where you take the current price of the stock and compare it to the tangle value of all its assets minus good will. AMD P/TB Ratio: 23.61 NVIDIA P/TB Ratio: 64.73 INTEL P/TB Ratio: 1.75 This says a few things; One either Intel has barely any assets worth liquidating relative to its stock price and the market has priced the stock appropriately, OR the price of the stock is selling for a very reasonable price related to the actual value of the company. This could be considered paying only .75 above book value of the company as a ""premium"" for future expected value. Source: Any trading platform that has data you ding dongs - go look it up. I got these from Schwab jfc. Technical Except for this past Wednesday, this company has been hard stuck around $30 after a selloff from its 52 week high of $51.28. 31.50 appears to be the most reliable resistance level we can work off of right now, then $32.50 after that. If it breaks both of those on a run up, there is literally no ceiling until $46. SO, you tell me what that means. The further you zoom out on your shitty little trading app the more you will see that this period we are in is nothing but consolidation. Foundry Intel's new foundry business will be the corner stone of its future growth. Forget the in house made chips. The company is not-so-silently tyring to be the American version of TSMC. Here is an article they posted on their own site outlining their model. https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-outlines-new-financial-reporting-structure.html#gs.a8z07s Note this section: April 9th 2024 ""Intel Foundry is a newly established operating segment that includes foundry technology development, foundry manufacturing and supply chain, and foundry services (formerly IFS). Under this new structure, Intel Foundry will recognize revenues generated from both external foundry customers and Intel Products..."" Fuck me, if they pull this off under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for this specific function, this stock could easily moon. Not to mention this article detailing that NVIDIA will start using Intels Foundry to start making its own chips. https://www.techspot.com/news/101725-nvidia-turning-intel-foundry-services-expand-gpu-ai.html#:~:text=Nvidia%20could%20also%20choose%20to,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202024. Chips Act ""U.S. Department of Commerce has proposed up to $8.5 billion in direct funding through the CHIPS and Science Act to advance Intel’s commercial semiconductor projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon. Intel also expects to benefit from a U.S. Treasury Department Investment Tax Credit (ITC) of up to 25% on more than $100 billion in qualified investments and eligibility for federal loans up to $11 billion. Proposed funding supports Intel’s previously announced plans to invest more than $100 billion in the U.S. over five years to expand U.S. chipmaking capacity and capabilities critical to economic and national security and acceleration of emerging technologies, such as AI. Intel’s investments are expected to create more than 10,000 company jobs and nearly 20,000 construction jobs, and to support more than 50,000 indirect jobs with suppliers and supporting industries. "" https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/us-chips-act-intel-direct-funding.html#gs.a8z5ze So yea Intel is gonna get paid, and quite a bit. The article states that they are slated to receive up to $8.5 billion, with a B. X86 chips - Speculation With Arm taking dominance over portable computers like laptops, tablets and phones, X86 looks pretty boring. Except you have to remember that both AMD and Intel are still cranking these bad boys out like nobody's business. The raw horsepower in these for desktop workstations and servers is still not matched by ARM and probably wont be for quite a while. Sure they are not quite as power efficient, but who cares in a data center or major compute space anyways. Intel owns almost all of the IP for X86 processors too. AMD has a little bit and they have made improvements and designs of their own that they have been able to patent, but INTEL is the OG maker of these chips. Arm will probably continue to dominate the landscape, but they are the people who license their chips are going to need them made somewhere. They will have like two options. Intel or TSMC. China What happens when CHYNA pulls the trigger and takes over Taiwan. Where is everyone gonna have their chips made? Arizona, that's where. TSMC and Intel are both setting up MASSIVE Fabs there. So, when all the other chip companies get absolutely smoked I expect to see a giant green candle on that morning for INTC. I will probably write more later but this shit got way long way fast.

Why I bought Puts on MNST (Monster).csv,"Since Monster releases its earnings report after market, it’s time for some puts… or calls if you are based and want to inverse me Reason 1: High expectations - Current expectations for this quarterly are quite high.. Expected earnings per share are $0.452 as opposed to the $0.400 of a year ago . In this same light the market expects (has already priced in) a nearly 200 million dollar increase in revenue from the year prior.. Put quite simply these massive increases are already expected and priced in, and it’s much easier to fall short when expectations are this high Reason 2: Competition - PepsiCo is fighting hard for market share of the energy drink market and threw $550 million dollars for an 8.5% share of Celsius in 2022. Monster has already struggled to maintain market share versus Red Bull, which owns the largest portion of the energy drink market.. Now on top of this already stiff competition they have to deal with a whale like PepsiCo flooding the market with products like Rockstar and Celsius over time Reason 3: regulation- As more health focused initiatives take place in Europe and America, products like monster will face increased scrutiny, both from consumers and governments alike (regulations on certain contents). Reason 4: Even those who hit their goals have been getting smashed… AMD and Reddit- Now I get what you are thinking “what the heck do these companies have to do with monster”… and yea they have no direct relationship.. But even after surpassing their goals for this last quarter these companies have seen their value get smashed.. The market is being mad weird and bearish right now when it comes to earnings. So in essence this combined with reason 1 (the high goals they already have), means that I feel that the odds favor the Put/bear side Hope you enjoyed my presentation!!

"Why I think Intel is a Misunderstood, Undervalued Play – A Bet on 18A (+EV DD).csv","Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.",0.5307,NEGATIVE,0.9997
Why Intel is the most undervalued tech stock right now.csv,"Intel ($INTC) is an insane bargain right now, as it is trading at year 1999 stock price. Every other comparable tech stock is up 5000%-20000% since then. People are too focused on Intel consumer and data center products, which by the way are improving at impressive rate. Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3).

They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons. Microsoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in. If you are a big tech company and want the best, cutting edge silicon you will have to switch to Intel foundry sooner or later.

I don't do options so maybe this is the wrong place lmao. I moved back home to my parents place when my dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Truthfully this has been the worst year of my life (and his obviously) in a lot of ways, but I've been investing since I was 16 (I'm 25 now). My dad worked in equities, so when he lost his ability to communicate effectively with me (and since I had significantly more income because I'm not paying rent) - I truthfully went ballistic on investing. Pretty much said fuck it, I'm living at home I don't need a 6 month emergency fund till I move out and went all-in. Granted 40% of my portfolio not listed here is in a 401k account entirely in the S&P 500 (set & forget just in case my equities went to hell as with the rest of my life lol). I believe in the margin of safety when investing. I like to invest in high-quality companies that generate lots of cash as the backbone of my portfolio. Since 2021 (before my dad got this cancer shit), I spoke with him and he basically said just look at the fundamentals of a company and invest in growth companies that you think will be around in 5-10 years. I look for value within growth stocks (i know paradoxical). Some of my icons in investing are David Tepper & Michael Burry. Again below is all my own experience and reflects only my own views and are not a recommendation of my company (corporate. disclaimer). My portfolio is heavily weighted (85%) between several stocks: AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL (So fucking cheap r u kidding me sorry), NVDA, AMZN, AMD, CRM, COST, RIVN (RIP), AVGO, VOO (ik not a stock) <-- I know semi(s) are very cyclical but i believe in holding all of these companies for 5-10 years, so I don't have to worry about temp. earnings beats/misses etc. Much easier to pick a stock and hold it for a while then it is to get the timing right. Roughly at 175% return in the past 3 years. (hammered META at $100's, NVDA at $200 both in 2022) Roughly 15% of my bets are moonshots (note the word bet hehe) with promise but objectively could be overvalued/bad investments: CCL/RCL (both are crushing it and between them own 75% of the cruise line market), LCID/RIVN (going to 0 bc they can't scale profitably or will make u a very happy person 3 years down the line bc R2/Atlas at 45k/50k should capture a significant portion of model y demand), TTD, DKNG/FLUT - gambling hasn't even been legalized in Cali/Texas (the biggest markets in the U.S. come on), RBLX (feels like betting against youtube in the early innings w/o realizing how much rev. they're actually recognizing), PYPL (value - cheap af (bought at $60) should turn around in a couple years) I joke I allocate like google's budget where it's 90% bread&butter and the rest are moonshots. Was very depressed (still reasonably depressed) because I'm not sure how much time my dad has. I hope in a way I can pass some of these stocks to my kid in a better place than I found it.

Morgan Stanley anticipates that AMD's core business will ""accelerate meaningfully"" as the PC market continues to recover and server upgrades resume. The investment firm noted that AMD is likely to capture a disproportionate share of these larger projects as upgrades progress. AMD's increased Q3 revenue guidance of about $6.7 billion at the midpoint reflects ""strong momentum across compute businesses,"" according to Morgan Stanley. This momentum underscores the company's effective strategy and execution, positioning it well for sustained growth. Artificial intelligence is also expected to be a significant growth driver for AMD. The company's advancements in AI technology and its strategic roadmap place it in a favorable position to capitalize on the burgeoning AI market. While there are potential delays in the deployment of new AI silicon, the overall outlook remains robust. Morgan Stanley maintains an equal-weight rating on Advanced Micro Devices and has raised its price target to $178 from $176, reflecting confidence in the company's future performance. AMD's strategic positioning and continued execution of its roadmap suggest a promising trajectory.

AI chipmaker Cerebras files for IPO to take on Nvidia - But 87% of its revenues have come from the U.csv,"The Middle East wants chips badly but US restrictions prevent the US most powerful chips entering into certain geographical areas such as China and the Middle East; this entails the UAE. Nevertheless, the UAE wants in on the GPU chips craze and is apparently willing to pay anything to enter into the chip bonanza. The UAE can't get Nvidia's, AMD's, or Intel's best GPU chips so instead they are investing heavily into alternatives such as Cerebras. There is nothing inherently wrong with this but it's also the biggest red flag as an investment opportunity. If the agreements for Nvidia chips open up in the Middle East and specifically with the UAE that could be a crushing blow to this aspiring startup. Specifically, Cerebras Systems reported a net loss of $66.6 million for the first six months of 2024, on $136.4 million in revenue. For the same period in 2023 it has a net loss of $77.8 million on just $8.7 million in sales. 87% of this revenue for the first half of 2024 was directly from the UAE G42. The other red flag from this startup is the way in which they promote their business. It's all seemingly smoke and mirrors and conveniently based on outdated GPU pricing and throughput information; which is very publically available. For some reason, Groq and Cerebras love to keep using memory to unlock speeds on small/tiny models which is impractical and inefficient for a scaled system; or a system that is a large foundational LLM. As well, they have no clue what models will do next so it's a major after the fact architecture that uses llama because they have access to it. https://cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebras-inference-ai-at-instant-speed. A prime example of this is OpenAI's GPT-o1 model that uses reasoning in coordination with its model capabilities. Because they are not being used on the forefront of this technology they don't know how or when a model's size, function, or needs will evolve into the future. All of this plus the pricing from OpenAI and Microsoft is coming down exponentially. For Example: They are referring to a 70b param model that shoves an entire model onto memory. They are going up against h100's which is a very old technology at this point. They make no reference to h200's let alone blackwell Because they are referencing such a small model the pricing model they suggest would be radically different for a 400b param model and forget about trillion param models which are coming next. They're not being truthful about tokens per s. As of today this is Azure GPT 4o and GPT 4 mini tokens per minute gpt-4o & GPT-4 Turbo global standard Model Tier Quota Limit in tokens per minute (TPM) Requests per minute gpt-4o Enterprise agreement 30 M 180 K gpt-4o-mini Enterprise agreement 50 M 300 As you can clearly see 30 million tokens per minute is 500k tokens per second and mini is 833,333 tokens per second. So i don't know why they are referring to 20 tokens per second or their 450 tokens per second seems way off. maybe they mean million. Even if that is the case and 70 b would be more like mini it is way higher than their limit. On pricing which they lay out a 3:1 input versus output is fine the price would be for mini which is a comparable model is roughly .10 cents (input) + .20 cents = .30 cents. Per million. for regular 4o it would be higher and let's face it GPT 4o is a far superior model than llama 3.1 3.33 dollar + 5 = $8.33 Source: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/ From this information what I can tell you is that what we just went over is pricing. it is not some guarantee for what a model produces per second. That shit is very random. What I can tell you is from GPT 4 to GPT 4 turbo to Gpt 4o the speed is dramatically better. GPT 4o mini is damn near real time. Take that for what it's worth. I am not saying they're being dishonest here but I am saying they are being very cheeky with how they advertise things. The company is currently being primarily supported by the UAE, with investments worth roughly $900 million for new AI supercomputers known as the Condor Galaxy series. Any growth here is singular to this source of investment and not driven by organic growth or usage. This is not a competitor to Nvidia but rather a temporary solution in the Middle East until chip embargoes are alleviated. The media here loves to use sexy headlines on non-technical verifications of what it is they are actually comparing. I.e. H100's are now old, or The fact an entity may need to serve millions of clients... No they are instead reporting self-prompting headlines from Cerebras that say things like our chips are 20x faster than Nvidia. Live Update: As I am writing and researching this topic it has just been reported by Reuters that the U.S. is setting a new rule to allow chip shipments to the Middle East including the UAE which is a boon to Nvidia and Microsoft. US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East Here are couple excerpts: WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), to data centers in the Middle East. G42, a UAE-based AI company with historic ties to China, has been a focus of those concerns. In April, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), opens new tab announced that it would invest $1.5 billion in the company, with plans to provide G42 with chips and model weights, sophisticated data that improves an AI model's ability to emulate human reasoning.The deal drew scrutiny from China hardliners in Congress, even though G42 said in February that it had divested from China and was accepting constraints imposed on it by the United States to work with American companies. LOL you can't make this up. Literally this just got reported by Reuters today 9/30/2024. This completely aligns with my argument above regarding the UAE-G42. With chips now entering into the Middle East from Nvidia and potentially others I don't know how this startup IPO makes it off the ground. I don't mean to be bearish but I don't think this is the time for them to raise an IPO without showing more progress. I could be wrong. As of now, I don't plan on buying any shares. Instead, I will be adding more shares into Nvidia because now this is bullish news for Nvidia.",0.5441,NEGATIVE,1.0

AMD CEO Lisa Su Says AI Is In Early Stages Of Multiyear 'Supercycle' 'There's Tremendous Need For Mo.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) shares are experiencing an upward trend after the company reported strong second-quarter financial results. Following the announcement, CEO Lisa Su emphasized that the chipmaker’s performance is being driven by a multiyear AI “supercycle.” What To Know: Recently, chip stocks saw a sell-off as earnings season approached, with investors questioning the timeline for significant returns on the massive investments in AI. This led to speculation that spending on AI might slow down. However, early earnings reports indicate that capital expenditures have remained robust. Su’s comments on CNBC’s “Squawk On The Street” Wednesday provide reassurance against slowdown concerns. She stated, “From the conversations that I have with our customer set and sort of the broader industry, we can see that AI is a multiyear, you know, I would call it a supercycle frankly. There’s tremendous need for more compute.” AMD reported second-quarter revenue of $5.835 billion and adjusted earnings of 69 cents per share, surpassing analyst estimates as its AI business continues to see accelerating demand. The chipmaker also updated its forecast, expecting GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion this year, up from the previous forecast of more than $4 billion. Su highlighted that analysts and investors are “hypersensitive” to minor quarter-over-quarter changes. She believes that the AI story should be viewed in a broader context, suggesting that the demand is extraordinarily high. “I wouldn’t be hypersensitive in those areas ... Are more customers using it? Is every enterprise asking for it? Are we seeing more applications on a daily, weekly, monthly basis? The answer to that is absolutely yes,” she said. “Everywhere I go, everyone wants to talk about how can we incorporate AI into our businesses faster and more efficiently ... this early in the cycle, there’s a lot of learning and experimentation, but definitely, there will be the return on the investment on the other side,” Su added. Although the return on investment isn’t “instantaneous,” it’s occurring very quickly. AI is already boosting productivity and enabling companies to bring better products to market faster. Su emphasized, “We’re investing today for the return in a couple of years, and I think that’s absolutely the right thing to do. That’s the way to think about these investment cycles.” AMD’s strategic focus on AI and its strong financial performance underscore its robust position in the rapidly evolving technology landscape, highlighting the company’s potential for sustained growth in the coming years.",0.5537,NEGATIVE,0.8673

Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year. This report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure. With Nvidia's earnings report on the horizon, AMD's results offer a useful benchmark. Although AMD has significantly underperformed Nvidia year-to-date, this could be an opportunity to turn the tables. Data Center Growth is Key Analysts predict AMD's data center revenue will reach a record $3.52 billion for Q3. In July, CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in strong revenue growth for the year's second half, driven by demand for Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. Earlier this month, AMD launched its latest data center AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, and investors are keen to see its performance. Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari pointed to sustained growth in AI infrastructure capital expenditure, a recovery in server CPUs, and AMD's ongoing market share gains.

"Apple reportedly seeks to lock out its competitors from TSMC's 2nm process, by booking all of its ma.csv","Apple has long been cozy with TSMC, the manufacturer of the chips that end up in ever-popular iPhone, iPad and Mac products. When you've got as much cash on hand as Apple does, it puts it in a favorable position to negotiate deals with the Taiwan-based chipmaker. Now it is reportedly seeking to lock in 100% of TSMC's bleeding edge 2nm production capacity, giving it a competitive advantage when products eventually make their way to the market. According to 9to5mac (via Extreme tech), Apple's chief operating officer met with TSMC bosses to negotiate terms to secure 2nm capacity. The report cites 'local sources', so there needs to be a pinch of salt here, but given Apple's track record of locking up TSMC's capacity, this would certainly come as no surprise. TSMC's 2nm process is currently scheduled to enter risk production in 2025, with volume production set for the second half of 2025. That means the upcoming iPhone 16 family with A18 chips will stick with 3nm, but it could mean the high end iPhone 17 Pro and Max could be the first in line to be built with 2nm technology. The specifics of deals between TSMC and its customers are obviously not made public, but it is widely accepted that Apple booked all of TSMC's 3nm capacity, at least for a period of time. These chips, including the A17 and M3 families made their way into the latest generation iPhone 15 Pros and MacBooks. That would make Apple's 2nm play unsurprising. It's easy to see why Apple would attempt to secure the maximum amount of 2nm capacity. It will give it an advantage over its competitors, as 2nm chips will allow Apple to pack in more transistors into a given area, leading to better performance or lower power consumption—if not both. Samsung has its own manufacturing capacity, and future Exynos chips will be built in-house, but 2nm Snapdragon and possibly Google Tensor chips may have to wait in line behind Apple. Even mega-companies such as Google and Qualcomm don't have the cash on hand to outbid big daddy Apple. It's not just Arm competitors that will be disadvantaged. Nvidia will want every possible power and performance advantage it can get as it dominates the market for AI processors, while AMD will also have to wait for access to the best nodes. Even Intel could find itself at a disadvantage given some of the tiles for its chips are manufactured by TSMC.

The bull case: Dominance in mobile market with full market share + demand for more compute + increasing royalties over license fees = money printer for arm Huge potential in laptop market, as demonstrated by Apple M series and most recently with Qualcomm’s latest snapdragon laptop processor. They are already dethroning Intel and AMD, who will be left playing catch up because x86 is too far behind in power efficiency terms. Infrastructure: everyone (literally everyone) is shifting towards arm processors for datacenter workloads. Look for huge growth in market penetration here IoT, automotive etc: arm still dominates in these sectors, with better and more modern IP for new applications AI: obviously closely tied to all these other areas as everyone desperately tries to slap AI in their products, the arm+Nvidia combo is the clear winner across all sectors in this space The bear case: RISCV: who cares? No one.

"BEARISH NVDA Development Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Intel developing open standard AI Accelerator .csv","Full Article: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-giants-form-industry-group-120000567.html NVDA's current GPU (AIPU) market domination currently stands at 85-95% of the accelerator market. This is pushing profit margins to extreme levels, protected by a moat defended by CUDA and their consistent R&D in the space, leading to further chip advancements along inference and power efficiencies at a much faster pace than their competitors (AMD/INTEL in particular). This new open standards alliance (UALink Promoter Group) for the interconnect (a.k.a backbone) of server clusters challenges NVDA's own proprietary interconnect systems, but will likely not be able to compete with the new B200 line being delivered in the coming months, due to its extreme efficiencies across GPUs and clusters. However, this new alliance is interesting, and combined with the hyperscalers consistently developing in-house specialized chips for model training and inferences, we will likely see a gradual decrease of market domination over the next 2-5 years.

Bloomberg Again Reports on Semiconductors With Flimsy Information on Secret Government Contacts.csv,"Usually, when things that are leaked with an intention the entity where the leak comes from is pleased with said leak. Not for Bloomberg though. Bloomberg actually accomplishes citing an anonymous source about on ongoing discussions related to chip distribution and subsequently takes that information to the White House National Security Council to ask them to comment. Here is the WHNSC's response. Bloomberg: US Weighs Capping Exports of AI Chips From Nvidia and AMD to Some Countries A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the talks but pointed to a recent joint statement by the US and UAE on artificial intelligence. In it, the two countries acknowledged the “tremendous potential of AI for good,” as well as the “challenges and risks of this emerging technology and the vital importance of safeguards.” The council responds with a no comment while directing them to a positive statement. To me, this greatly diminishes whomever the Bloomberg contact is. This is the second time that Bloomberg goes out of their way citing a leaky government source that on it's own merits isn't really that sensational at all. The headline is sensational the reality is not. The approach would set a ceiling on export licenses for certain countries in the interest of national security, according to the people, who described the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Officials are focused on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing appetite for AI data centers and the deep pockets to fund them, the people said. This isn't even news. Reuters reported on this a month ago with a much more neutral to positive tone. Which it is. Reuters: US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia to data centers in the Middle East.Since October 2023, U.S. exporters have been required to obtain licenses before shipping advanced chips to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.Under the new rule, data centers will be able to apply for Validated End User status that will allow them to receive chips under a general authorization, rather than requiring their U.S. suppliers to obtain individual licenses to ship to them. If you're tracking, this simply seems to be the 2nd half of that original conversation. There are already chip restrictions. Nvidia is already not delivering the most advanced chips to those countries. The framework proposed would allow Nvidia to deliver chips under certain restrictions and guidelines. Bloomberg acknowledges this towards the tail end of the article. While officials have debated the best approach, they’ve slowed high-volume AI chip license approvals to the Middle East and elsewhere. But there are signs things could get moving soon: Under the new rules for shipments to data centers, US officials will vet and preapprove specific customers based on security commitments from both the companies and their national governments, paving the way for easier licensing down the road. What I don't understand is why does Bloomberg like to make things salacious when they're seemingly not. There is 0 chips to parts of the Middle-East today, but the U.S. government is working on a framework that may relieve that. Reuter story from a month ago. The end. When you read the headline one would believe that they are already selling these chips to the UAE and they're not.",0.5344,NEGATIVE,1.0

For the US and European AI Software Sector the restrictions should be regarded as good news, because with less systems being sold abroad, they won't have to wait that long for their orders.

Could PLTR go on a TSLA-like Run (70%) if Included in SP500.csv,"On June 7th, S&P 500 is set to rebalance and Palantir will be eligible for the third time. With the spotlight on AI and Palantir's continued strong performance, there's a very high likelihood it is included in the S&P, which could lead PLTR going on a Tesla-like run. First, let me break down why Palantir is a great candidate for inclusion. Inclusion in the S&P 500 index involves meeting several stringent criteria related to market capitalization, liquidity, financial viability, and corporate governance. For Palantir Technologies (PLTR) to be considered a good candidate for S&P 500 inclusion, it must satisfy these key requirements: Market Capitalization: A company must have a market cap of at least $14.6 billion (as of 2023). Palantir's market capitalization has been above this threshold for a while. Liquidity: Companies need to have adequate liquidity, with a high trading volume. Palantir's shares are actively traded, reflecting strong investor interest and sufficient liquidity. Financial Viability: The company must report positive earnings in the most recent quarter and over the last four quarters combined. Palantir has demonstrated profitability, reporting positive GAAP EPS in recent quarters (InvestorPlace). U.S. Based: Companies must be U.S.-based, with the majority of their assets and revenues derived from the U.S. Palantir fits this criterion, being headquartered in Denver, Colorado, and deriving significant revenue from U.S. operations. Public Float: At least 50% of a company's shares must be in the public float. Palantir's public float percentage is adequate to meet this requirement, with substantial institutional ownership indicating wide distribution among public shareholders Palantir meets all the eligibility criteria, the only which could be a problem is corporate governance, ie, the insiders own a lot of shares of the company; however there are tons of examples of other companies that have a similar structure. As many of you know, Tesla went on a 70% in the weeks leading up to and the month following its inclusion. However, it's not alone. Many other ""sexy/high-profile"" names go on epic runs when SP500 inclusion is announced. Twitter (TWTR) Inclusion Date: June 7, 2018 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $26 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on May 21, 2018, Twitter's stock increased by approximately 14%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, Twitter's stock increased by about 5%. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2019 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2019, NXP's stock rose by approximately 10%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, NXP's stock increased by around 6%. AMD (Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.) (AMD) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2017 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $20 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2017, AMD's stock increased by approximately 12%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, AMD's stock rose by around 9%. T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS) Inclusion Date: June 22, 2020 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on June 5, 2020, T-Mobile's stock increased by approximately 8%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, T-Mobile's stock saw an increase of about 7%. NVIDIA (NVDA) Inclusion Date: November 18, 2001 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $25 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: NVIDIA's stock saw a significant rise, roughly around 20-25%, in the weeks leading up to the inclusion. Month Following Inclusion: The stock continued to perform well, with an additional increase of around 10-15%. ""S&P 500 effect,"" is a real phenomenon and I think it's even more powerful with high-profile names like Palantir. As mentioned earlier, Tesla went on a god-like run in the weeks leading up to and after the announcement. And I think Palantir shares many characteristics with Tesla that may see it go on a similar run. Both companies have a very high-profile CEO. Alex Karp is loved by Palantir holders just like Elon is by Tesla fanboys, which leads to my most important point: retail ownership. Palantir has a significant amount of its shares outstanding owned by retail; if SP500 inclusion is announced and institutions have to buy shares it may create a similar move like Tesla's as most palantir fanboys won't sell. Like Tesla, they believe Palantir is changing the world (look at their subreddit). I think buying Palantir options is a great upside play with limited downside, depending on when you purchase your options. The inclusion announcement is on Friday after hours, so you could buy Friday before close or anytime this week and sell Monday morning if its not included for a minimum loss. And with options being so cheap, this could be a 50-bagger if it goes to 30 bucks. 6/21 23 C 6/21 25 C.",0.5557,POSITIVE,0.7174

How Terrifying is the Start of August.csv,"Just over the past three trading days, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 indices have all recorded their largest three-day cumulative decline since June 2022! Last night, the Nasdaq plummeted by over 6% at one point, and the S&P 500 dropped by more than 4%, with both indices returning to their early May levels by the close of trading. Although the major U.S. indices and individual stocks still closed with significant losses, the intraday declines were somewhat moderated. The primary reason for this was the release of the U.S. July ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, which rebounded from a four-year low in June to 51.4, exceeding market expectations and returning to the expansion zone above 50! Sub-indices, including the New Orders Index and Employment Index, also showed growth. Notably, the Employment Index reached 51.1, marking the largest increase since September of last year and the first time this year that it has entered the expansion zone above 50. This data slightly alleviated fears from last week's significant non-farm payroll decline, making the market believe that the drop in new jobs was primarily due to Hurricane Barry hitting Texas. 👉 As discussed previously, the sharp decline in U.S. stocks at the start of August stemmed from worries about the U.S. economy falling into recession. Therefore, when the ISM Non-Manufacturing number showed growth yesterday, it somewhat restored market confidence in the economy, helping to narrow the intraday losses of U.S. stocks. The U.S. stock market now needs to see positive economic growth news to recover, unlike before when everyone was hoping for bad news, anticipating a Federal Reserve interest rate cut! Hence, it is crucial to continue monitoring other economic data. If strong and robust growth numbers do not consistently appear, investors will remain concerned about an economic recession, and the trend of selling stocks for cash will not end.

Taiwan is protected by its geography and weather, but the Chinese have two windows of opportunity to cross the Strait with favorable weather. The first is from late March to the end of April. The second is from late September to late October. Last year, China launched major military exercises around Taiwan in April. This year, they did it in October, which just ended a few days ago. (They also launch these exercises when they are provoked, such as when Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan or during the recent Taiwanese elections.) In my view, the end of October triggers a relief rally in stocks related to TSMC, most notably AMD and Nvidia. This combines with earnings and strong seasonality, resulting in massive outperformance in a relatively short period of time. A quick word of warning—this time period includes earnings. If you want to avoid earnings risk, you can wait until the first Monday of November. If you wait until November, the average return is 19.06%, and the stock is higher 77.78% of the time by the end of the year. Here is a quick comparison I do all this shit manually so I apologize if there is an error in one of my calculations. My positions: Long 1000 shares with a cost basis of $157.90. Although I am considering switching to a risk reversal. I would use a risk reversal selling the Jan. 2025 $155 puts collecting 12.70 then using that to buy twice as many Jan. 2025 $180 calls for $6.50 (I would buy x2 as many calls to make the net cost ~.30)",0.5754,NEGATIVE,0.8872

In INTC I trust.csv,"I've shifted my entire S&P 500 holdings into Intel, and here's why: The AI Revolution: NVIDIA currently dominates the AI technology landscape, and that’s indisputable. Their unmatched tech and visionary leadership have set the bar high. However, with the U.S. aiming to maintain its global leadership, relying on a single company for AI tech could become a security risk and a bottleneck in innovation. Why Intel Could Be the Game-Changer? Intel (INTC) is uniquely positioned to disrupt NVIDIA's monopoly. Alongside AMD, Intel possesses the expertise and resources needed to engineer AI chips. Enter Gaudi 3. If Gaudi 3 lives up to the hype, Intel’s stock could potentially skyrocket, doubling in value in a matter of months hands down. Government Backing: The U.S. government and major institutions are already showing their support for Intel, recognizing its strategic importance in the tech race. Positive Vibes: Reviews for Intel's Arrow Lake architecture are rolling in with strong positives, indicating that Intel's on the right track to regain dominance.

INTC - A dumb person's retrospective.csv,"I'm lazy and you regards don't like to read so I'll leave it to bullet points and you can piece them together. Intel was seen as a bargain in 2023 compared to NVDA and AMD after their 400% run up. US gov have vested interest in Intel. No they are not propping Intel up, but it's effectively giving Intel a big loan to buy a second house. That loan can pay off if the housing market goes up, or they are double fucked because they leveraged to buy a second house. If you bought Intel because china will invade Taiwan, you are really regarded. If China invades Taiwan, everything is going to sell. That's a disruption of global trade on WW2 levels. Your best case scenario still loses you money. Intel bullish scenario is 18A, High-Na EUV paying dividends, early experience granting them a year technological lead over TSMC. It doesn't have to work, but the upside is a 10x from these levels. TSMC pass up High NA EUV is repeating the same decision Intel did in 2012 when Intel controlled the market and did not view EUV as economically feasible. Again, doesn't mean TSMC is incorrect in their assessment, but history does repeat itself. Intel bearish scenario is just repeat of 2016 and delay after delay. In which case they head to legacy company status like Ford. Anyone else remember all the Ford bulls in 2016? They're not on this sub anymore because they all went broke. I'm no crayon guy. But everyone can see that $30 was a magic line, and drastically going below it to $21 is a market signal that the company is now viewed fundamentally differently. Yes it can go lower, especially the general market trends change we see this week. AMD spent from 2008 to 2016 an absolute garbage penny stock.

You kids don't even know struggle. Struggle is putting your 1k paycheck on AMD calls every week thinking this week you will hit. Just to watch Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs dropping a $12 PT downgrade on you when the stock turns even a little bullish. The investment only somewhat paid off in 2018 when AMD traded to 30, but then half the regards lost everything (myself included) when it crashed to 18 in 2 months following Powell's rate hike. Look how quickly sentiment changed for AMD from 2018. This very well could be history repeating itself, as the semiconductor companies have demonstrated over and over again. Intel 18A is a repeat situation of AMD ZEN. The upside cannot be understated. I'm still bullish. Proper execution can bring the company to a $200+ stock. I bought and sold Intel throughout the year. 8000 shares from 35 to 50, sold at 43, bought at 35, sold at 30 before earnings. I was up 130k, lost 100k of it. Bought 2500 shares at 21.30.

Intel - Pinnacle of failure.csv,"Intel's Slippery Slope: Financial Woes, Investor Distrust, and Leadership Issues Intel Corporation, once a dominant force in the tech industry, is now grappling with a series of significant challenges that have fueled a troubling decline. Despite attempts to project a positive outlook, the company’s current trajectory suggests a troubling downward spiral. Financial Performance and Market Challenges Intel's financial performance has continued to deteriorate. For the first half of 2024, Intel reported revenues of $24 billion, marking a slight decrease compared to previous periods. This decline is occurring amid a broader tech sector recovery and highlights Intel’s struggle to maintain its competitive edge. The company's net income for this period was a mere $800 million, translating to a profit margin of approximately 3.3%, indicating substantial operational inefficiencies and intense competition from rivals such as AMD and NVIDIA. Declining Customer Satisfaction and Product Concerns Customer dissatisfaction remains a critical issue. The release of Intel's 14th Gen Core processors has not addressed the performance inconsistencies that plagued previous models. While the company has introduced new features, reviews suggest that these updates have not significantly improved reliability or performance compared to competitors. This ongoing issue is eroding customer trust and impacting market share. Eroding Investor Confidence Investor confidence in Intel is faltering. The recent involvement of Apollo Global Management has raised concerns, particularly following Apollo’s controversial investment decisions in other sectors. Additionally, a recent lawsuit filed by major institutional investors alleges mismanagement and failure to deliver on key performance promises. This legal battle has further shaken confidence, prompting several large investors to divest from Intel, exacerbating the company's financial strain. Leadership and Legal Troubles Intel's leadership is facing intense scrutiny. Recent high-profile exits, including the departure of several senior executives, have led to a perception of instability at the top. The company's reliance on legal strategies to address its challenges, rather than focusing on operational and strategic improvements, appears to be aggravatinh its difficulties. This reactive approach is not addressing the underlying issues affecting Intel’s performance. Future Prospects and Potential Downturn Intel’s future prospects remain uncertain. Despite a significant $15 billion R&D budget, the company’s progress in key areas like AI and autonomous driving lags behind that of its more agile competitors. Moreover, while short-term production issues in Taiwan have provided some temporary relief, these are unlikely to reverse the long-term downward trend. The competitive landscape continues to evolve rapidly, and Intel’s slower adaptation could hinder its recovery prospects. TL;DR Intel’s current strategy, which includes overhauling its product lineup and executive team, appears to be a desperate attempt to stabilize its position. For investors and stakeholders, the warning signs are clear: Intel’s challenges are substantial, and the company’s efforts to turn things around may not be sufficient in the face of ongoing and evolving issues.

Intel is a good buy.csv,"We are all well aware Intel is having it's own Boeing moment right now with design flaws in their CPUs and horrible customer service. They deserve the steaming pile dooky that is currently sitting atop their share value. That being said, they have an ace that may flip the entire market on it's head: They own their fabs. That's right: all the other big boys in town design and give their blueprints for TSMC to manufacture. That's true of AMD, Nvidia, and other ARM and mobile chip designers. Intel is the only large scale chip designers that is more or less vertically integrated. As you may know, they just got $8.8B from papa Biden to build more foundries in Ohio and Arizona, in addition to their other sites across the world. None of this is particularly noteworthy until you consider that China has always been very interested in Chinesing Taiwan, and are even more so now that they have been embargoed from Nvidia chips by the US. The Chinese military build-up over the past decade has focused heavily on amphibious warfare, and long range anti-naval weapons (think carrier buster ballistic/boost-glide stand off weapons.) It doesn't take a Ph.D in geopolitics to understand what the move is here. On the US/allied side, the discourse around Taiwan has slowly shifted: what started out as ""we have overwhelming force and we will stop any attempt at an invasion of Taiwan"" has become something like ""Maybe we can't stop them from invading, but we can make it a Pyrrhic victory"". This may actually be the case, but the trend is not great. You will have noticed Taiwan has been increasingly politically isolated, mirroring the growing Chinese military power in the region. So what happens to TSMC if Taiwan gets Chinesed? As you can imagine, China is interested in acquiring as many TSMC assets and personnel intact as possible. This means you can bet your degenerate bacon that US intelligence services have contingencies to extradite key scientists and engineers, and scuttle the production plants and machines before the Chinese can take control of them. But the result is easy to predict: no more TSMC. This means the personnel extradited will be used to advise and run US production plants owned by, you guessed it: Intel. Intel will have a quasi monopoly on chip manufacturing. The US government see this of course, that's why they are strongly nudging Nvidia to play nice with Intel, because they see a potential future where Intel is the only player in town capable of making Nvidia chips, or any consumer chips at all for that matter, in the West.

Intel is a pretty safe bet and are undervalued.csv,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs. An additional benefit is that Intel can leverage their fabs in order to achieve higher margins for their own products. It's possible Intel's stock could be hit again in a month or so when their report comes out, but they are likely already at bottom.",0.5493,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Is INTC undervalued .csv,"Valuation Analysis of Intel Corporation Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has long been a key player in the semiconductor industry, but recent market developments and the rise of competitors like AMD and Nvidia have caused its stock to significantly underperform relative to its peers. As of Q2 2024, Intel’s total assets amount to approximately $182 billion, with liabilities around $91 billion, resulting in a net asset value of $91 billion. Yet, its market capitalization is around $95 billion, reflecting an almost 1:1 ratio between market cap and net assets. In contrast, competitors such as AMD and Nvidia trade at significantly higher premiums, indicating that the market may be underpricing Intel’s growth potential. Company Market Cap (Billion $) Net Assets (Billion $) Price to Net Asset Ratio Intel 95 91 1.04 AMD 266 56.5 4.71 Nvidia 3,000 58.15 51.58 Understanding Intel’s Valuation The Price to Net Asset Ratio (P/NAV) is a critical measure of how the market values a company relative to its net assets. Intel's current P/NAV of 1.04 reveals that its market value is nearly identical to its net assets, a valuation that appears surprisingly low, particularly when compared to its competitors. AMD and Nvidia, for instance, demonstrate P/NAV ratios of 4.71 and 51.58, respectively. This significant gap highlights the possibility that Intel is undervalued, especially given its strong fundamentals and growth potential. Several factors support this assessment. Despite facing fierce competition, Intel remains a leader in the semiconductor industry, known for its quality and innovation. The company is making substantial investments in new technologies and manufacturing capabilities, positioning itself to capitalize on growing trends such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, Intel boasts a robust balance sheet, with total assets of about $182 billion and liabilities around $91 billion. This financial strength provides a solid foundation for future growth and strategic initiatives. Although the recent decision to lay off 15,000 employees might seem concerning, it is part of a broader strategy to enhance operational efficiency and focus on core competencies, enabling Intel to adapt more effectively to evolving market demands. A key factor influencing Intel's future is the increasing global demand for semiconductors. As technology becomes more integrated into daily life, the need for high-performance chips continues to rise. Intel's resources and commitment to innovation position it to capture a larger share of this expanding market. Moreover, government support for the semiconductor industry adds another layer of potential upside for Intel. Given the strategic importance of semiconductor manufacturing in light of global supply chain challenges, particularly concerning the Taiwan-China situation, there is growing interest from government entities to bolster domestic semiconductor production. This focus on strengthening local supply chains can create favorable conditions for Intel, as it could receive both financial incentives and regulatory support to expand its operations and enhance its competitive positioning. Conclusion In summary, Intel Corporation is significantly undervalued based on its current P/NAV ratio. The company possesses strong assets, a history of innovation, and a strategic focus on future technologies. As Intel continues to execute its strategic plans and navigate market challenges, it has substantial potential to regain its competitive edge and achieve remarkable growth. Furthermore, the increasing government interest in supporting semiconductor manufacturing amid geopolitical uncertainties enhances Intel's prospects.

Long-time AMD Holder (Cost Basis 1904) Starting to Sell - Anyone Else Disappointed in the Stock in 2.csv,"Wrote about my thinking below... Out of the 31 large banks, 25 have a “buy” rating and 6 have a “hold” rating on AMD 0.29%↑. It’s hard to think about why to sell when everyone is telling you to buy, but I am of the opinion that is when it should be most deeply considered. image credit to tipranks.com AMD has been my most profitable investment of the past 5 years, having risen 800% since purchased in August of 2018. For most investors (including myself), it’s difficult to part with winners. Not only that, I am someone who believes AI will proliferate throughout society in the coming years. Because they design data center GPUs, AMD should be one of the primary beneficiaries as the AI boom continues. It might seem counter-intuitive then to sell the stock here, but that is what I’ve begun doing over the past two weeks. I had high hopes for AMD this year, but it’s my view that they've failed to take significant data center GPU market share from Nvidia, and will have increased competition from Intel's new product offerings (on both client and data center), as well as proprietary silicon from large cloud players (Google, Amazon, etc). My original thesis was that AMD would profit from overextended Nvidia margins in 2024, but this underestimated the CUDA ecosystem moat that existed with Nvidia data center products (see Why I Got Nvidia Wrong). While most large cloud players want to diversify at least somewhat from Nvidia, they are still unable to do so without risking a competitive advantage with their own AI offerings. Add Intel into the mix, and the margin and market share pressure will be on AMD. The only player in the silicon value chain I think which can currently raise margins is TSMC (TSM 2.61%↑), but the geopolitical risk is too high for me to continue holding the stock (I sold my TSMC stake two weeks ago). On the PC (personal computer), Nvidia has always had a strong moat. It’s not just because they have the best performing products, but also because game developers are economically incentivized to optimize first (and often only) for the largest potential audience. This is similar to the moat CUDA protects on the data center side. One might think that Nvidia charging incredibly high prices for discrete graphics cards would cause them to lose share to AMD with consumers who directly purchase the products (as opposed to businesses who purchase the data center products). Yet Nvidia market share has only grown over the past few years. Data from Jon Peddie Research Why This Take Could Be Wrong: There is a lot of bullish momentum in the investor community around AMD currently from both professional commentators and retail investors (e.g. Twitter / X). Many people who had never heard of AMD 5 years ago are now saying to put money into the stock as it is Nvidia’s only pure AI competitor. As a result of this, AMD could see a dramatic rise on a positive earnings report later this month. In addition, I expect gaming revenues to surprise to the upside with the minor refresh of Xbox and Playstation consoles coming for holiday season. I still have ~260 shares of AMD remaining, and will likely hold to see if the stock jumps on the report. I think that AMD is extremely stretched in its current valuation (P/E of 205), and that any bad news could send it spiralling. Selling half of the remaining stake now is essentially a hedge against this possibility. Whatever happens with the earnings report, I will likely reduce my AMD holdings to zero in the next few months as I continue to lower exposure to companies reliant on Taiwan.",0.5591,NEGATIVE,0.9976

Wells Fargo ($WFC) must face a lawsuit over sham job interviews Rate Cut Countdown — Will the Fed Finally Pull the Trigger? Nope, the Fed isn’t cutting rates this week. But don’t snooze just yet—this meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn’t overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy—he's searching for that ""just right"" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same. Inflation: Cooling Off Inflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year’s 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the ""last mile"" of inflation reduction. The message? We’re on the right track, folks. Unemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it’s taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell’s recent take? The labor market isn’t adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a “sweet spot”—balancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals. Risk Management Reboot With inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed’s risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle—slightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed’s past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they’re determined to act promptly to avoid a recession. Some Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it’s time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn’t seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first. The Fed’s balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31. McDonald’s: The Golden Arches Stumble By the Numbers Revenue: $6.49 billion (missed $6.61 billion estimate) Earnings per Share: $2.97 (missed $3.07 estimate) Same-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020) U.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7% International Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1% International Franchised Sales: Down 1.3% McDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening. Value Meals to the Rescue The fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn’t translated into higher overall sales just yet. Internationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk. Defying the Odds Announcing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away. Despite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a ""buy"" and none recommending a sell. Looking Forward The golden arches are taking a ""forensic approach"" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales. So, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future. On The Horizon Tomorrow Economic Data and Earnings This week is buzzing with key economic data, especially on the employment front. Tomorrow, we'll get the June JOLTS report, which stands for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. This report measures job openings, hirings, and separations (like firings and retirements), offering a detailed snapshot of the U.S. job market.

Microsoft’s Cloud Rain on Earnings Parade In a classic case of “so close, yet so far,” Microsoft ($MSFT) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, only to see its stock plummet over 5.79% in after-hours trading. Why? Investors fixated on the company’s disappointing Azure cloud revenue. Earnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints Microsoft’s revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure’s performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue—just shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub’s impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn’t enough to quell investor concerns. By the Numbers Revenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected Market Reaction and Future Outlook While the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft’s other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure’s growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn’t enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft’s shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500’s 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market’s laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters. Chips Ahoy! AMD’s Data Center Sales Surge 115% AMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let’s break it down. Earnings Breakdown AMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street’s expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter AI Chips and Data Center Dominance The tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company’s overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast. Other Segments and Market Reaction While the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD’s business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year AMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high. On The Horizon Tomorrow’s labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let’s be honest, they’re all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week’s job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes. Before Market Open Boeing ($BA): Trouble in the skies and on the ground.

My Analysis on ARM Holdings 2 Trillion+ Valuation.csv,"I believe ARM Holdings is slept on! I believe it could be the next NVIDIA. As of this writing its Market Cap is sitting at $142.36 Billion. I believe that its market cap should be ATLEAST 1 trillion due to the fact that it has an enormous market share of damn near if not more of 95% of the worlds smart device chips. What makes ARM unique is its business model. Their primary source of revenue is from the leasing of the design of the instruction set of computer chips. For those who dont know the instruction set is often referred to as an instruction set architecture (ISA), is a group of commands for a CPU in machine language. These commands tell the processor what operations to perform. Each instruction in the set specifies a particular operation to be performed on a specified set of data operands. The instruction set is fundamental to the design and functionality of computer chips, dictating how software communicates with hardware... So what is unique about this? Well I will tell you, these instruction sets are incredibly energy effecient compared to what is used currently for AI such as RISC or X86 etc. Currently NVIDIA is soaring because of the AI craze and its success has put light onto AMD, INTEL, SMCI etc but I believe ARM is a sleeper in my opinion. Their main source on revenue is through the royalties it recieves for leasing its designs. They can easily raise the royalty rate to increase their revenue stream anytime but there are some downsides. There customers could leave them and use other options. I dont think that is going to happen because lets face it their intellectual property is far better than any of the competition in terms of effeciency. AI is growing rapidly and one key expense is going to be energy consumption. Especially in these data centers. To my knowledge most data centers run on chips that use x86 from Intel. Those chips using that instruction set uses alot of energy. I believe data centers are looking to convert to a more energy effecient chip and when they do.... ENTER: ARM. Arm is currently used in almost all smart devices because again they are energy effecient. Why do we have longer battery life in a smart phones? Its because of ARM. What chips do electric cars use? ARM what instruction set does your microwave, fridge, washing machine use? ARM. Currently ARM is all over the portable device market but once they hit the data centers I believe there revenue is going to explode and therefore the market cap. There are major catalysts going down right now such as Microsoft partnering with them to make ARM based laptops and NVIDIA collaborating with them to make computers, not to mention that Tesla ordered a ton of NVIDIA chips that use ARM architecture. But my most bullish thing about ARM is what Jensen Huang said at Computex. He said that AI will eventually become physical in terms of robotics. Do you think those robotics need a energy sucker of a computerchip instruction set? No, the need the most energy effecient tech in todays age and that where ARM steps up right again. Currently we only use AI remotely (Chat GPT, Picture Generators, Etc.) but once we put AI into something physical and tangible such as robots to do everyday tasks those devices and robots need to run on the most advance and effecient software. I am currently looking at an outlook of 5-15 years and I am long on my position is this stock. We all seen what nvidia did and can only imagine what the next stock can yield the same returns and I think its ARM Holdings. Imagine going back to 2017 and investing into NVIDIA when the markect cap was the same as ARM now. Those returns look nice right if you have invested then. The time is now. Please keep in mind that i have not decided to go completely in depth of all of my research on ARM Holdings so please do your own. Also, I purposefully did not go into fundementals such as earnings and revenue on this. This is just my personal long term outlook on the research I have done. There are plenty more catalysts and risks out there so please DYOR. Feel free to comment!",0.5404,POSITIVE,0.9991

After last year we were like WTF how is this 300 a share let alone 1400 a share in June. July 2024 $GOOG $AMZN up ~80-100% for the year. Look, its logical to take profits. No shame in that especially for retail who loses out 90% of the time. July 2024: Rate cuts like 99.999% almost certain for sept. Now suddenly Small/Mid caps rally in a massive sector rotation. $SPX/$NDX tanks. Next week: 1T outflows. Then they pump and dump the russel up 12% to 2022 highs and then sell off for a quick 6% while everyones FOMOing into $RUT. Maybe more like RUT RO!!!! I Fomo'd last of dry powder MOnday but after earnings I'm turning bearish. Tomorrow 5k realized loss for me or hold to 0. Too hard to beat the street. Profit taking, buying million dollar real estate with cash like smart investors do. Sit on the sidelines and let it bleed. But here we are still FOMO'ing calls and short dated puts that would only print 1/1000 times. Over the past few days 3 mag 7 earnings all tanked and here we are. AMD? CPUs Good for gamers and graphics cards for poors. Pennies compared to $NVDA. $NVDA has a monopoly on AI software like $ASML has a monopoly on lithography and $TSM has a monopoly on chip production. $TSLA obviously seemingly doomed. Google can't take your cookies anymore, advertising revenue down MoM. Wanna get cucked by the zuck? I'm tempted to donate $1 to people wanting to buy $META calls at this point. TLDR: This looks like the same pattern we have had in 2022 and 2023 when markets take a downturn through mid-late October. Look at the previous years. I posted last week about the last 4 septembers being red. It looks like we are in another downturn. Earnings indicates it. I don't think CPI and PCE will save us this week. I'm scrounging up 25k waiting for the correction / dip / crash and buying SHARES so i never waste so much of my lifetime just to lose money speculating with options. Will post my realized losses if you think I'm BS. Thanks for reading this or just the TLDR. Looking forward to discussion!",0.5416,NEGATIVE,0.9998
My thesis on INTC going into 2025.csv,"I am going to add my technological and geopolitical fundamentals here, because I think these are going to be important factors heading into 2025. Disclaimer: I own 575 shares of Intel at an average PpS of $29.30 I think most analysts are forgetting that the next president is the same guy who is trying to block the acquisition of US steel by Nippon steel at all costs, regardless if it makes financial sense or not because he wants to retain as much American Manufacturing as possible and wants it to succeed. Most of the ""AI revolution"" has happened over the past 4 years where the administration had no problem letting foreign chip manufacturing take the lead. Intel is competing with TSMC, and TSMC receives massive subsidies and discounts from the Taiwanese government which dwarf the 7.9B (which was even reduced) from the US government. On top of that, the US government is also giving slightly less in subsidies, 6.6B, to TSMC to build in the US. So really, the current administration is not giving Intel an advantage over TSMC. The most effective thing that they could do is levy tariffs against Taiwan, which the next president has gone on record stating he wishes to do, instead of subsidies. This would increase demand for American chip manufacturing; while TSMC can manufacture in the US, CoWoS packaging is done outside of the US, in either Malaysia or Taiwan, and would cause the product to be subject to tariffs. In the chip design space, Intel is hopelessly behind on GPUs compared to Nvidia, and now Apple, Amazon, OpenAI and others are designing their own chips and using TSMC for manufacture. Intel still dominates the CPU space, but your average datacenter rack might have 10/20+ GPUs for each CPU. AMD is also a viable alternative to Intel for CPUs, and as such takes about 25% of the market. Intel's only way to compete in the GPU space is in the cost performance market, which mainly targets budget gaming, crypto mining, and cheap datacenter. The newest release of the ""Battlemage"" B580 is expected to compete with Nvidia's 4060 at the under $300 MSRP market, which are lofty goals. Nvidia and AMD still have offerings in these spaces but they are not lucrative ones. So Intel is basically competing to be a 3rd rate designer in the US, while they still have the CPU lead it matters a lot less for the lucrative markets right now. It's clear that on the design front, Intel is not going to receive much help to be successful. While this is their core business and majority of revenue, it is a business they are falling behind substantially compared to others. Design demand is GPUs and they are late to this party. Revenue for products is expected to stagnate or decline unless they have a competitive GPU offering. However, the US needs to have a domestic cutting edge chip manufacturing supply chain. It has expressed as much as a result of the 2022 supply chain shortage when we realized that letting TSMC manufacture 90% of the world's sub 5nm chips was a bad idea. That was the motivation behind passing the CHIPS act; Pat Gelsinger was instrumental in advising the current administration for this. The method for doing so has left a lot to be desired; Pat himself even expressed as much given the delay in fund disbursement, which in all fairness was only accelerated as a result of the election result and comments from republicans that they wanted to repeal the act. TSMC is not allowed to have the latest node fabricated in the US by law of the Taiwanese government. This is so that the country keeps its ""Silicon Shield"", the dependence globally to have manufacturing be done there which keeps Taiwan protected from China. But Intel has no such limitation. And TSMC is not able to fufill 100% of the orders for its customers; it is aggressively building more fabs to keep up with the ever increasing demand of AI. This demand exists for Intel to take part of. So, Intel in the next administration will have a tremendous amount of support for its Foundry, not Products, side of the business. This leaves Intel with a potential alternative to many of the scenarios analysts predict: It could solely dedicate to Foundry and sell off its Products division, most likely to AMD which shares the x86 architecture already and is solely focused on design. This would allow Intel to become a Foundry for external customers without having a conflict of interest, which I suspect is keeping them from customers. The CHIPS act stipulates that Intel has to retain a majority stake of Foundry but NOT Products, so this does not prevent Intel from dedicating itself to Foundry, which is what the US wants. I think Pat was waiting for the right climate to do this and it is coming soon. It is sad he did not stay long enough to see it happen. If Intel received the same amount of support from the US government that the Taiwanese government gave to TSMC, and was able to win external customers as a result of Tariffs, it could become the US TSMC. Much of this hinges on the 18A and later 14A nodes which are competitive with TSMC 2nm, which is the current cutting edge. But I think this is the desire of Intel and the next administration, and so they will work towards this goal. To diminish foundry would be a slow death for Intel. That is why I am still looking forward to Intel in 2025. If you got this far, thank you for reading. EDIT: Now that I think about it, it is also entirely possible for Qualcomm to buy Intel's Products division. I think they expressed as much earlier this year, but being they are primarily ARM I am not sure if it would be a good fit.",0.5359,NEGATIVE,0.9956
My views on why NVDA beats earnings and flies to higher supports Likley past 200.csv,"For the PE bitchers and moaners, I leave you this: AMD Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 126 NVDA Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 69 Chanos bitched and moaned all the way to the broke house where he had to close shop.

NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming Latest Sept 2025, with my guess, Jensen starts marketing from first half of 2025, and wider release commercially of NVDA CPU for 1st qtr of 2026, March, me thinks Jensen starts getting market ready all of 2025 for release in the wild September 2025 for retail user and full wider release by March 2026 / end of February 2026. Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?.. I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025.

Nearly every other chip designer abandoned fabs because businesses operate best when they focus on what they do best. Intel is unique in that it is set up to transform the business into a major foundry model going forward. That takes decades of investment which Intel is ahead on. One day, Intel may fabricate chips for Nvidia, AMD, Texas Instruments, Apple, Qualcomm, and Microsoft. This is due to their potential leadership in silicon photonics and quantum computing.

NVDA has been all the rage and justifiably so.csv,"Since NVDA reporter its Q1 2023 earnings, revealing huge demand for AI chips, the stock has surged to $3.3T. Revenues 4x, margins up expanded and everything seemed perfect. Bulls claimed the stock was getting cheaper to decelerating growth. Quarterly revenue growth has dropped from 88% to 34% to 18%, heading towards single digits. Next quarter we’ll see just 7%. All of the marginal buyers are in — sucking the last few retail buyers in with the lure of a split. History suggests short term bump after a split as we are seeing, but now institutional investors have a vast pool to distribute their shares in coming months. As the saying goes, “when the ducks are quacking, feed them.” If the quarterly revenue growth continues to moderate, earnings growth will be impacted as well — making the stock become more and more “expensive” (multiple screams higher) versus the theme of last year when the higher it climbed the “cheaper” it got. This does not change the fact that it is a great business with a great leader — which will play a role in the advance of AI technologies and productivity. It’s just going to be a heavy lift that it retains a perception of greater value than Amazon, Microsoft or the entire German Stock Market Capitalizations (where it trades now). NVDA is still a semiconductor company, which has never been a secular business — it’s cyclical. Always has been, always will be. As for 70% gross margins, as Bezos famously said, “your margin is my opportunity.” NVDA has not cured cancer. There will be more and more competition going forward. Intel’s Gaudi 3 is 50% faster than NVDA’s H100 and 40% more energy efficient. AMD is gunning for them.

And then we have a rich, a very aggressive cadence of Falcon Shores products following that. We also added the Gaudi 3 PC IE card to it, this use case of Xeon plus an accelerator or Gaudi accelerator is getting very good response from customers as well. So we'll be bringing that out later this year. But the real story is delivering the TCO value, delivering the enterprise use cases.

"NVDA will hit 5T market cap in 2026, and 10T market cap before 2032.csv","Hi regards, This is not a ""copium"" post about the recent stock price drops. I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest. The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY. First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"". Name Stock price EPS SP/EPS ratio AAPL 230 1,4 164 MSFT 413 2,95 140 AMD 145 0,16 1.035 META 516 5,16 100 AMZN 171 1,26 135 NVDA 116 0,68 170 As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price. But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list. AAPL Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits. How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new. But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more. MSFT They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are. They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy. They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office? AMD I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first. Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware. Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software. And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section. META They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value. ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS. AMZN The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL. NVDA AND OUR STAR CHILD. HOT TOPIC OF 2024. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company. Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?

You can't have this kind of transformation without people getting overexcited for a few years. But we aren't at that stage yet. Look at how long the dotcom bubble took, and more importantly, look how the late stage was characterized - explosion of IPOs. Until we get a flood of IPOs, we aren't in the late stage. Until we see an IPO for SexRobots Inc, we aren't in the late stage. At the moment we've got a handful of companies beating expectations because of AI revenue (good for Nvidia, long-term), and some beating CapEx expectations because of AI spending (good for Nvidia, short-term) The current situation Look at Nvidia P/E compared to its share price. We're halfway through the year. At the end of this fiscal year, Nvidia will be worth $180 at the midline of this trend. It is currently $113. That is a 57% return, 157% on an annualized basis. Nvidia is down 17% from its peak. Its hard to call the bottom, but yesterday we saw a major flash crash followed by a v back up. Much like the opposite of the ""blow-off"" tops that we see when the bull runs peak. Big volume selling, big volume buying. Big down, big up. I expect the fast bears used that to get out. The slow ones will watch their profits start eroding before also bailing and taking their gains. The slower ones will hit their stop losses, and the slowest will drift back into the red. If you're a bear in the green, take the W and get out Upcoming catalysts Other company earnings next week - MSFT, META, SNAP, AMD, ARM Upcoming earnings What are the market expectations for next earnings? They say they are expecting $0.59 per share. But last quarter Nvidia made that, on the back of 26B in revenue. For this quarter, Nvidia predicted 28B revenue. If they hit that, we're looking at $0.66. But of course they're being conservative. Why wouldn't they? When your growth is 262% you have plenty of room to estimate conservatively. How conservative are they usually? Last time they predicted 24B and hit 26B. If roughly that amount extra happens again, we're looking at 30B in revenue and $0.70 in profit.

NVIDIA (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang Points to 1 Trillion Opportunity for the Company.csv,"Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the next few weeks until the US election would be “confusing” for many since no one could say anything with conviction about who is going to be in the White House. Lee said that the market is going to trade “well” into the upcoming Fed meeting where he expects “some” rate cuts amid the labor market needing support and positive inflation data. Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said: However, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive. For this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that a trillion dollars’ worth of general-purpose data centers will inevitably transition to accelerated computing. “We’re in a computer revolution,” Huang said, pointing out that the first wave of data center modernization is driven by generative AI, which he described as more than just a tool—it’s a skill. Huang also emphasized the need for “densification,” with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) aiming to make data centers more efficient by compressing them into smaller spaces. He discussed NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it. Nvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia. Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave. At Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range. Of course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.

Nvidia The only problem you're gonna have is that you didn't sell more.csv,"Introduction Alright, so Nvidia is crazy overvalued right now. Just check out its P/E ratio – it's sitting at a whopping 73.94. And that's not all. Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.55, and the price-to-sales ratio is over 42. These numbers are way above what you typically see for tech stocks and the semiconductor industry. There are two big reasons why Nvidia's stock might take a hit: growing competition and lowered margins. Growing Competition First off, the competition is heating up big time. 🔥 AMD's MI300 series is a beast, merging CPU and GPU on the same chip, which is great for performance and energy efficiency. This is super important for data centers and AI applications, and it could seriously cut into Nvidia's market share. AMD is coming in hot, and Nvidia might end up feeling the burn. Then you've got Intel with their Gaudi3 GPU, which is packing some serious performance and efficiency for AI and machine learning tasks. More people might start switching to Intel's GPUs, giving Nvidia a run for its money. Intel's Gaudi3 could be the ghost in Nvidia's machine👻 Lowered Margins Then there's Amazon, which is throwing its hat into the ring with custom GPUs for their EC2 instances. These GPUs are optimized for machine learning and AI, and they integrate perfectly with Amazon's cloud services. This seamless integration could mean less reliance on Nvidia's products, pushing Nvidia to cut prices to stay competitive. Lower prices mean lower margins, which isn't great for Nvidia's bottom line. Amazon could very well turn Nvidia's margins into margin call memes. 📉 Adding to the heat, TSMC is thinking about jacking up production fees for Nvidia. The chairman's plans to raise prices could eat away at Nvidia's margins even more. If TSMC hikes those fees, Nvidia might have to dig deeper into their pockets, and that could be a real pain in the margins. 💸 Link (06/04) So yeah, Nvidia's stock might be flying high right now, but with all this competition and pressure on margins, it might not stay that way for long. It's looking like Nvidia might be headed from tendies to tears if they can't keep up. 😂 TL;DR Nvidia is trading high, but AMD, Intel, and Amazon are bringing the heat. 🔥 Competition + TSMC price hikes = potential margin squeeze. Stock might go from 🚀 to 💥 if they don't keep up. 😂",0.5456,NEGATIVE,0.9812
Nvidia's Blackwell Delay Offers Investors A Chance To 'Add To Positions' says Goldman Sachs.csv,"Nvidia Corp (NVDA) finds itself at the center of tech speculation as reports have surfaced about potential delays in its much-anticipated Blackwell architecture. With tech giants like Nvidia often facing the heat of public and market scrutiny, the slightest hiccup can stir investor unease. But is this delay really a cause for concern, or just a blip on Nvidia’s otherwise smooth journey towards AI supremacy? According to a report by The Information, Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell chips might hit a speed bump, delaying their release by over three months due to alleged design flaws. These chips were set to ship later this year, boasting promises of up to 30x better Inference performance over their predecessors. Despite this setback, Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs advises investors to remain calm and continue with their current strategies. The delay, while not ideal, is unlikely to impact Nvidia's 2025 earnings power or its market dominance, according to Hari. “We expect there to be little to no impact on CY2025 earnings and, most importantly, the company's long-term competitive position.” Hari believes that any short-term volatility in Nvidia's fundamentals will be just that—short-lived. The Market Reaction: Opportunity or Overreaction? For those ready to jump ship, Hari's advice is clear: stay the course. Nvidia's stock might experience some turbulence, but the company’s strong footing in the AI market isn't going anywhere. “We would consider any near-term dislocation in the stock as an opportunity to add to positions.” Despite a recent 15% correction, Nvidia remains a top pick, firmly seated on Goldman's Americas Conviction List with a 12-month price target of $135, suggesting a potential upside of nearly 26%. Even with Blackwell’s reported delays, Nvidia’s projected 39% year-over-year growth in 2025 remains unchanged. Hari’s bullish stance is rooted in Nvidia’s role as a crucial player in the rapidly evolving AI sector, especially as the demand for advanced AI infrastructure shows no signs of slowing down. Implications for Rival – AMD Interestingly, while the Blackwell delays might appear as a dark cloud over Nvidia, there could be a silver lining for competitors like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (AMD). “We believe the market could perceive this development as a marginal positive for AMD — the only alternative to Nvidia today in Data Center GPUs.” Although the analysts say AMD is unlikely to overtake Nvidia due to Nvidia’s strong market position and AMD’s challenges in scaling operations, this situation could still present a competitive boost for AMD. What’s Next for Nvidia? In the tech world, where speed and innovation reign supreme, a three-month delay might seem significant. However, Nvidia’s legacy of innovation and market leadership paints a different picture. As Hari points out, “any impact to CY2025 earnings will be negligible,” and the temporary setback should not deter investors from seeing Nvidia’s long-term value. For now, Nvidia’s strategy remains rock solid. The potential delay, whether factual or exaggerated, is but a temporary hurdle, according to Hari. As Nvidia navigates this challenge, the market watches closely, with many investors seeing a buying opportunity amid the noise. For those invested in Nvidia's future, Hari’s message is clear: hold steady, as the AI revolution waits for no one.",0.5505,NEGATIVE,0.9994
NVIDIA's share price surge and the outlook for the AI arithmetic market bubble risk and rational lay.csv,"As NVIDIA's share price has risen sharply in the short term, many have begun to wonder if the industry is facing a turning point or if there is a bubble. From the perspective of the industry giants, GPUs, as representatives of A1 arithmetic chips, are currently far from meeting demand. We can assume that AI applications are still only in their infancy, and there has not yet been a particularly prominent Al burst application in the world. Analyse the results: The AI market is still at an early stage: AI applications, despite explosive growth in recent years, are still at an early stage. The arithmetic power required for current AI applications (e.g., big language modelling, autonomous driving, robotics, etc.), especially GPUs, is still in the pre-burst stage. The growth of Tesla and the robotics industry, for example, predicts that billions of robots will be needed in the future for arithmetic support. This means that there is a huge potential for growth in AI arithmetic demand over the next few years, especially in inferential computing. GPUs as core hardware for AI: GPUs play a key role in AI inference computing, especially in tasks that require high parallel processing power (e.g., deep learning inference, autonomous driving, robot control, etc.). Although there are already many GPU products on the market, overall, the demand for AI computing power is still in a state of oversupply, and the size of the AI computing power market is likely to continue to expand, especially in the ‘reasoning’ segment of the demand for this segment is the area of high computation, especially in the field of automated driving, cloud computing and so on. Personal view: NVIDIA's leadership in the GPU space is well recognised, but many are beginning to worry about an industry bubble due to the short-term surge in its share price. NVIDIA's dominant position: Currently, NVIDIA is the almost unrivalled leader in the field of AI hardware (especially GPUs), and its products are widely used in AI training and reasoning calculations, especially playing a central role in large-scale data centres and cloud services. NVIDIA's rising share price reflects investors' optimistic expectations about the potential of the AI market. Bubble Risk: As NVIDIA's share price has surged, the market has become sceptical about whether it is overvalued. NVIDIA's high valuation could lead to the formation of a bubble, especially if its products and technologies are not sufficiently digested by the market. While the AI industry is promising, the market is volatile in the short term and the rise of competitors (e.g. AMD) could change the market landscape. Therefore, investors and industry observers need to be wary of market overheating and short-term speculation. Core view: US tech giants (e.g. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook) are supportive of NVIDIA's technology, but they will also support NVIDIA's competitors, such as AMD, in order to avoid the arithmetic market being monopolised by one company and to ensure the sustainable development of the industry. Analyse the results: Rational rather than short-term profit-driven: the behaviour of these tech giants suggests that they are not simply pursuing short-term profit when purchasing AI arithmetic, but are planning the security and sustainability of their own development in the long term. By supporting competitors such as AMD, these companies avoid the risk of the market becoming too dependent on NVIDIA alone, ensuring diversity in market competition and technological innovation. This kind of rational decision-making is crucial to the healthy development of the AI hardware market. If NVIDIA dominates the AI arithmetic market without competitive pressure, it could lead to overpricing, affecting the interests of other tech giants. As a result, companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon prefer to ensure diversity and healthy competition in the AI arithmetic market by supporting competitors such as AMD. In summary: future outlook and risks Huge potential for AI arithmetic: The demand for AI arithmetic is far from reaching its ceiling, especially in the area of inferential computing, and the market demand for GPUs will continue to grow as robotics and autonomous driving technologies evolve. The adoption of AI technologies will generate even more demand for arithmetic power in the coming decades, especially in emerging technologies such as robotics and autonomous driving. NVIDIA's dominance and risks: While NVIDIA's dominance in the AI hardware space cannot be ignored, the sharp rise in its share price and high market valuation have raised concerns about the existence of a bubble. Future technological competition, especially the rise of competitors such as AMD, may affect NVIDIA's market share. Long-term layout of industry giants: U.S. tech giants are very rational when investing in AI arithmetic, they will not simply pursue short-term benefits, but pay more attention to the diversity of the arithmetic market and the sustainability of the technology, to ensure that they can be invincible in the competition in the coming years. The AI arithmetic market is full of great potential, but is still in the early stages of development. While NVIDIA occupies a leading position in the AI hardware market, its high valuation and share price volatility also make the risk of a bubble",0.5575,POSITIVE,0.7135
NVIDIA’s next catalyst has to be sovereign AI.csv,"NVIDIA’s current valuation is not overtly expensive (FPER: 33, PEG: 1.61 according to FINVIZ) and the GPU orders for next year are all booked. Yet the stock is meeting strong resistance around $130. I think this is partially because a lot of people have been burned by CISCO during dot-com bubble and do not want to price in the future too much. But the real concern is that their revenue is almost entirely dependent on the rest of M7 and they are charging the big tech 80 % margin. The big tech, while being hammered by Wall Street for the increased CAPEX spending, indicated during last earning that they will not reduce their investment on AI. However, they did mention that they are/plan using their NPU (Google TPU, Tesla Dojo, AMD) to reduce the usage of NVIDIA GPU. Furthermore, GPT5 and Apple Intelligence should be available to the public by the end of this year. If these do not impress, the entire AI sector may see significant slowdown. But if GPT5 shows plateauing of performance while people find Apple Intelligence interesting, paradigm could shift toward smaller models and inference efficiency, again reducing the demand for NVIDIA. To justify significant increase in NVIDIA’s stock price, they need to show that they are not entirely dependent on the Big Tech. The only other potential buyers that have as much buying power are governments. Also, if the economy is going through downturns, governments have excuse to increase their spending. What I am paying attention to during the earning call is demonstration from NVIDIA that they are receiving significant demand from non-Big Tech such as governments.",0.5529,NEGATIVE,0.9994

Short Call Strategy Am I Regarded or Might This Actually Work.csv,"Okay, so I'm guessing a good amount of us in this subreddit were new to options trading at some point in time, and when we were just itty bitty option noobs first hearing about them, we just thought: "" Wow! this is just the same thing as betting on stocks but with leverage right?"" (might just be me when I first got into options trading but whatever). Moving on. I assume that many people's first instinct was to go and buy a call on a stock they were very bullish on. And I would assume that once we did that, we lost the entire position because we never knew how theta decay, IV, DTE, strike price, and other factors could sink your entire position. The thing about these factors is that when you buy a call, the majority of these factors are stacked against you, and if you don't want them to be completely stacked against you, you gotta pay up for a higher premium which is gonna yield the same or less of a return then the lower priced (but considerably more risky) options. You're paying for less risk. Long Calls are usually only profitable when the underlying has a significant enough uptick to outweigh all the other factors dragging down the value of the option. I'm sorry I don't mean to repeat the basics of valuing options but I think it's important to pretext them a little bit so my strategy makes more sense in the grand scheme of things. Okay, so my strategy is as follows: why buy a call, and have all of these factors stacked against you, when you can sell one, and have them work in your favor; I guess the whole basis is: the shittier the call, the better (meaning how likely it is to expire or be exercised with no value). The even better thing is we can magnify the shittiness to work in our favor on the sell side by selling balls deep out of the money calls, with low IV, and few DTE. And we can magnify this even further by selling calls on options with really shitty stocks underlying; stocks that are down 40% YTD, or just really, really stagnant not moving anywhere (might also get some sexy low IV to work in your favor there too). I don't really have any stocks in mind right now to lock this trade in off the top of my head, but $NOC and $AMD are quite down this last month and a half, and are relatively popular stocks. Like I said I need to find some better stocks for this Strat; these are not the ones I wanna go with, just what I thought of off the top of my head Now you might be saying two things: 1. ""The prices on them are probably gonna be pennies on the dollar. Sure the odds might be in your favor, but the yield is gonna be very low"", and 2. ""What fucking moron is gonna be stupid enough to buy these calls?"". To answer question 1: Why not just sell more calls? And to answer question 2: I don't think I need to illustrate the stupidity of individuals in the market, but if you need me to, here you go: WSB regards (not dissing, I am also a WSB regard who has lost thousands on YOLOs), teenagers with a Robinhood account that just found out about options, and maybe even people who are legit investors, but have bought the call as a part of some bigger options play, like a straddle, or iron condor (not to mention that in the example of the straddle, I don't think they would really give a shit if the call tanked because, well, it's a straddle lol, the put on the other side would cover the losses and make profit{and yeah there are probably more plays where this is the case that I am just forgetting about, but this is the example I'm just gonna go with for now}). Not to mention markets are huge and I've checked the open interest on some of these calls and there are hundreds going up to the thousands in open interest on balls deep OTM, 2DTE, Low IV call options. Anyways, I guess the reason I made this post is to double check with some options veteran (I've been into options for a little less than a year, but I have some knowledge on them from my job) to see if this strategy is complete delusional manic retardation, or if there is actually some substance to it. I wanna make sure there isn't some variable or factor I'm not accounting for that could tank this entire play.

SMCI 1 day later.csv,"Hello fellow regards, Yesterday i had made a post on this subreddit about how SMCI is an undervalued stock, and that it is heavily involved in the future of AI, due to them supplying server systems to big companies such as AMD and Nvidia. I had also stated that the stock is undervalued, however, even though the stock had skyrocketed 12.5% today, i still strongly believe that the stock is still undervalued at $875 as it hit $960 a month ago and $1229 around march. The company also had stated that they want to supply 1000 liquid cooling racks per month, and increase their 1% market share to 15% within the next 12 months. This means that the stock has a lot of room for growth and i firmly believe that it can reach a market cap of $75 billion after its next ER, which would make the share price at around $1300. I am currently holding 10 shares right now, which is down from my 20 shares from yesterday as i had sold at $880. However, if it dips, i may buy more shares, but if it continues to rally, then i may hold onto the 10 shares i have as of right now.",0.5837,NEGATIVE,0.972

SMCI loose analysis and opportunity simmering.csv,"SMCI golden age and beautiful chart. After hours Friday SMCI jumped almost 9 percent! Makes perfect sense that investors are flooding back into this stock! It has been so beaten down over the last six months by bad press and fears of fraud. Those fears have been quelled by a new CFO and auditing team. We just saw in the last month of 72% rally and there is still plenty of room to run on Monday it will open up around $48, the last critical level we saw was $49. Also, it looks like a somewhat sloppy cup and handle pattern is forming. My half baked technical analysis is. We will see a minor pull back around $50 to finish the pattern, then it will launch back up to the next critical level around $60 a share. Fundamentally speaking, they have been showing plenty of growth and demand for their products which mainly consists of hardware to House semiconductors, especially their trademark marked water cooled rack, which directly addresses a huge issue that centers are facing as computing power gets to Skynet levels. Their price to earnings ratio is a modest 21.9, the earnings per share is a humble 2, the ps ratio is 1.5 which is the lowest among its competitors. In fact all of its metrics or lowest amongst its competitors except for the EPS for AMD, which is 1.1. There will be much to see within the next quarterly earnings report and how they managed to address their auditing issues and reporting issues. But I think this company still has room to run and definitely has legs. I have 200 shares with plans to buy much more. I was going to buy on the next red day, expecting it to be Monday, but I digress. Next pull back I’m buying calls with a strike price of about $49-$55 exp in March. Even considering a YOLO.

"SMCI will skyrocket soon, DONT MISS OUT!.csv","So currently SMCI is around the $840 to $850 levels but hit $775 on monday. This meant that there is still a chance to buy SMCI while the shares are cheap right before they release their earnings in a month. The reason why im bullish on SMCI is because AI is driving the stock to skyrocket as they work alongside Nvidia and AMD in providing data centres. Elon musk had also catapulted the stock to reach over $1000 as he had tweeted that he is partnering with Dell and SMCI to provide AI data centres for its generative AI chatbot. https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/super-micro-computer-ceo-post-picuture-with-elon-musk-at-ai-data-center-432SI-3505317 As a result of this, SMCI will most likely smash their earnings report of $8.10 per share in early august and hopefully make the stock reach above $1100, which is a 30% increase from what the share price is today.

They also have a PE ratio that is lower than Nvidia and AMD at around 45, a foward PE of 21.79 and a PEG ratio of under 1.

Strong AI and Semiconductor weeks ahead.csv,"Hi all, I think that AI and esp. Semiconductor Stocks have a couple of strong weeks ahead. Starting on Tuesday, October 15th 2024, the Open Compute Project (OCP) global summit takes place in San Jose, California. Between 9 AM and 11:30 AM there'll be short keynotes (each 12 mins) presented by Meta, NVidia, AI Clusters, Intel, AMD, Microsoft and Google (full schedule here). Now, I don't think that there'll be any big surprises. But the Summit still presents an opportunity for public remarks about how strong the demand is or what so ever. Also, there's an article that says that Broadcom (AVGO) is going to show case cutting-edge AI infrastructure. Further it is expected that Taiwan Semiconductor Company (TSM) and ASML Holding (ASML) will publish their Q3 earnings next week. TSM will present its earnings on October 17th 2024 at 14:00 Taiwan time / 02:00 Eastern Time. So pre-market movements will most likely be wild on Thursday as a large part of the industry relies on TSM. If TSM reports a great Q3 revenue, this could push Nvidia over the current all time high. Also according to Moore's law is dead, the first RTX 5000 series GPUs are ready to be sold, but are not released because of business reasons (here at 22:22). So they could still change their mind and ship in Q4. Next, it is rumored (by moore's law is dead) that AMD will release a new CPU by the end of October or early November, the 9800X3D which is an 8 Core Gaming CPU with 3D cache and it is expected that it will be the fastest gaming CPU releasing this year. Although Client is not as important for AMD, it will still be beneficial to have this CPU released before the holiday season. Especially since Zen5 Rysen has so far been viewed as rather disappointing. Moore's law is dead also mentions an RX 7650 GRE GPU, which could launch alongside Ryzen 9800X3D. Releasing a slightly refreshed and cheap RDNA3 GPU could be a good move by AMD to get rid of RDNA3 stock ahead of the RDNA4 launch in 2025. Since the Ryzen 9800X3D has not yet been anounced, I don't think that it has been priced in and could give the stock a slight boost to recover from the -4% last Thursday. Also, I although Investors were not excited about AMDs Advancing AI event, I think AMDs position in the market is still solid. According to the slides shown at the event, AMD Epic has increased its market share to 34%. And according to tests AMD Epyc Turin obliterates Xeon 6 Granite Rapids, while being cheaper. Because of this, I think AMD is in a good position to gain more server market share. Further, the news about Nvidia Blackwell being sold out for the next 12 Months is not only good news for Nvidia but also for AMD. Sure, everyone wants blackwell. but if one can't get blackwell and if AMD Instinct MI325X is faster than Nvidia Hopper (H200), then they might be able to win over customers from nvidia, who would like to buy blackwell but can't in due time. Also, AMDs earnings should be reported on October 29 2024. Due to Ryzen Zen5 being disappointing and there being apparently a large RDNA3 stock remaining. If AMDs Instinct systems are selling well, this would also be good news for Micron Industries (MU), which produces high bandwith memory (HBM3e). And then there's Intel. Their newest releases seem to have been disappointing. But they claim to be making progress with their foundries.

They are frequently gamers, so they need to buy NVDA GPUs and AMD CPUs. They often buy these at AMZN. They buy YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, so they can skip the ads of their fellow influencers (GOOGL) They spent most of their waking hours at META's Instagram website. They drive a TSLA or RIVN. They're on the GLP-1 drug (LLY) to impress their SOs. They're churning their credit cards with AXP Platinum and Gold, JPM's Chase Sapphire Preffered (no, NOT Reserve), some younger ones need to rely on COF's Venture and Venture X cards that gave nice ""subs"". They use these cards frequently to eat out and earn those points at CMG, SHAK and SG. They're flying a lot on DAL, and they need their free wifi that is often sponsored by their preferred choice of mobile carrier, TMUS. To get to the airport they need to use UBER or LYFT, since they don't want to drive their sweet electric ride. When they arrive at their destination airport, they pick up their rental car, and of course they prefer AVIS (CAR), but their credit cards give them presential circle status on HTZ, so they are ok with that too. They check into their hotel room at Marriott (MAR) to impress their friends, but really they are using all their Chase points to book Hyatt (H) hotels. The slightly less premium young ones will have to go Hilton (HLT) and fly on UAL. They often booked all this travel on EXPE or BKNG. Sometimes they use ABNB. When they check in they need to get some food, so they use their DASH gift card they bought at COST every two weeks because they get 20% off. When they go to Vegas, they prefer to stay in WYNN, because it's where all the hot ones stay. After they're done with their holidaying which they do basically 4 months out of the year, they're going to ULTA or LULU to buy their beauty products or Khakis. They are drop shipping on SHOP and sometimes they need to use ZM to conduct ""business"" for their ""coaching classes"" that they teach. A lot of times they get paid using Venmo (PYPL).

"The next tech giant Why HOOD, PLTR and DKNG are the investment opportunities of a lifetime (Part 1).csv","I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong. $AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice. $NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were. And so in true wsb fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB. There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long. From a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about. And so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry : If you are under 40 years old, $HOOD (Finance), $PLTR (Defense) and $DKNG (gambling) will 100x during your investment horizon.

The short report for Intel (INTC) - A rabbit hole of CPU failures rate since 2022.csv,"Forenote: Im a technical person, A developer, this will be a technical DD to show how intel is failing to do their basic business model of manufacturing CPUs. Over the past month or so Intels customers have been becoming increasing irrate about CPUs just flat out dying after various finger pointing from Intel being debunked. I first caught wind of intels failures when a friends system started to become unstable, he would crash in games and sometimes doing mundane tasks. It all came to a clicking point when his systems files started becoming corrupted and he needed to attempt reinstalling windows. The attempts failed, windows couldnt even install without corrupted files, sometimes it would install and look fine, but running a verification shows that various system files were still corrupted but not important enough for the system to boot successfully. He would still get various crashes doing mundane things and gaming. It was basically a working brick at this point. So i got my research hat on, and discovered various reddit users on r/pcmasterrace were also reporting instability with their PCs. Not alot tho, this has been the wierd thing, Intel has such a large CPU failure rate, but not alot of reports which caught everyone by suprise. It started to make sense, the causes of the crashes were different for everything. Users were reporting issues with Nvidia, Issues with RAM, and issues with corrupted data. Obviously to any layman, these issues dont instantly point to an issue with the CPU. With GPU errors, Nvidia initially got heat, but Nvidia quickly debunked the issue reporting the GPUs that were returned were fully functional and had no issues. So I pulled out my handy dandy debug tools since my friend managed to get windows installed and it kinda runs. The first tests I ran were memory block verification. This validates that the memory is able to hold data immutably, after 4 hours the tests finished all green, the memory was stable and wasnt corrupting data. (its worth noting that the memory test software I used was very CPU lite so the CPU has little chance to corrupt the data its self, this is a stark difference to the Drive tests I ran.). Since my friend was getting corrupted files almost everytime he install anything, I ran the disk debug tools, these pull the S.M.A.R.T data from the drive and run various read and write tests. The S.M.A.R.T data came back green, the drive was reporting it had no errors or irregularies and was functioning fine, So i moved to the read and write tests, all red, the drive had a 90% file currption rate, I pulled the S.M.A.R.T data again, All green, the drive was still reporting it was functioning correctly. At this point, anyone would deduce they had a bad drive that was misbehaving, leading to the decreased number of CPU failure reports. After all, How can you say the CPU is bad when you have corrupt files? Many people forget how much the CPU is responsable for. When you read files or write files, its the CPU that tells the Drive what to store and where and what to read and where it is on the disk to read it from. and as i said, the software I used to test the drives is CPU intensive, it uses the the CPU to generate random data to store on the drive and hashes that data to verify it. So a bad CPU = Currupted data on the drive. Luckly my friend has 4 drives, So I told him to take out the ""bad"" drive and put in another one, I ran all my tests again and same result, the drive was reporting it was functional, but all the data was corrupted. The result was the same with all the drives tested. Now, this is a luxary many people dont have. Many people would get corrupted data on their drive and think the drive is dying and get a new one. However with 4 tests samples all failing the same way when days ago they were all fine is a very low chance. Now for the kicker, Intel has a tool to verify that the Intel CPU you have is a genuine Intel CPU, I guess intel has a problem of china making fake intel CPUs??? Ive never seen any but what the hell, its a useful tools since its does some basic CPU level checks. So i ran the verifier tool and its first test for a genuine CPU comes back green, Cool, it is a real Intel CPU. Memory test comes back green (We alreadt tested this soo good), next was the Graphics tests. Failed, the CPU was attempting to send data to the GPU and it corrupted the GPU memory. So now we have 2 symptoms. Disk data corruption GPU memory corruption My friend has Nvidia GPU and Nvidia previously debunked any issues with their GPUs. But we have a common cause, Intel CPUs are corrupting data when sending it to another device in the system (except RAM), Data sent to a disk gets corrupted and data sent to the GPU gets corrupted, which would explain the game crashes. Various other tests passed from boost speed changing, Wifi tests and math operations. After I finished all the tests and determed the issue is with the CPU, my friend RMA'd the CPU. This is where more troubles start. Intel refused the RMA, citing user damage, According to intel all the issues my friend was having was his fault and he caused the damage, After it was refused, I filed the RMA for him, to the same response, but because im a stickler I pushed for more info, Intel was refusing the RMA because of overclocking done by the motherboard. This is a previous blame game intel played, they were blaming Motherboards for putting in stock overclocks on CPUs causing them to fail, but this wasnt the case with my friend, his motherboard wasnt even stock overclocked, but intel refused it anyway. After this point is when the waterfall started coming down, a advanced tech-youtuber posted an exposé about intels CPU failures. See: Intel has a HUGE problem - Level1Tech the curtains were starting to fall, Apparently Game developers and datacenters (Intels BIGGEST customers) were getting large amounts of CPU failures specificly with intel CPUs. Now datacenters are normally quiet about this type of thing, opting to sort their issues directly with intel, but intel is turning away datacenters RMA's of thousands of CPUs, these datacenters has since publicly reported they are dropping intel systems from their products and only supporting AMD systems from now on. Intel has lost their largest customer base, because of their defective products and refusing to take responsability for the product inherit flaw. Intel is hoping this goes unnoticed, since reports are still low of CPUs failing because the errors are random and different each time and users dont know their CPU is defective, there isnt a big in your face ""The Intel CPU in this system has errored"" its always an error with something else, which is caused by the CPU. So intel is betting on customers blaming other manufactures like they did with Nvidia when this all started. Timeline of events: [Dec 2022] The first instances of ""Out of Video Memory"" issues on 13th Gen Core i9 CPUs were reported back in 2022. (Source: Reddit).

[April 2024] Motherboard makers quickly roll out ""Baseline"" power profiles in new BIOS, which lower power limits on high-end 14th & 13th Gen CPUs but also lead to significant performance drops. [May 2024] Intel releases a statement, recommending motherboard makers to ship ""Intel Default Settings"" in BIOS by default rather than customized settings. [June 2024] Intel discovers a bug within its eTVB microcode while investigating the root cause of 14th and 13th Gen Instability issues. This doesn't fix the instability problems. Board makers quickly roll out BIOS with a new microcode fix. [June 2024] Alderon Games publishes about there players, developers and servers Intel CPUs failing over a period of months and switch to only AMD systems. [July 2024] Intel denies an RMA to HardwareTimes editor who already RMA'd at least two CPUs which produced instability issues. [July 2024] Wendell from Level1Techs & Steve Burke from GamersNexus are the first big tech media outlets on YouTube to further highlight the instability issues, diving into additional details such as OEM frustration with the matter and a possible recall. [July 2024] GamersNexus highlights a potential ""oxidation"" defect being a problem with a certain batch of Intel 14th & 13th Gen CPUs that might lead to instability problems. [July 2024] Intel says the 14th & 13th Gen Mobile CPUs are not affected by the same instability issues as the desktop CPUs. [July 2024] GamersNexus reports they will not be recommending Intel CPUs regardless of the outcome for upcoming AMD 9000 series reviews [July 2024] Intel issues a statement confirming that they have found the root cause of the instability issues which happen to be elevated operating voltages and will be issuing a new microcode fix to its partners by mid of August [July 2024] Users are reporting instability issues with Intel 14th gen Laptop CPUs.

Edit: Ive received internal leaks from Intel employees explaining internal issues and intels failures. Source 1: The leading theory inside Intel right now, and it is just a theory, is that the Ring Bus is getting cooked because it's fed by the same rail as the P-Cores and E-Cores. Raptor Lake required incredibly high voltages that the clocks required to be competitive with Zen 4, and it seems like it was just pushed too hard. This is an inherent flaw that would be in Bartlett too it's overvolted. Meteor Lake isn't affected, and Emerald Rapids is unlikely be effected materially. Source 2: I never worked directly on Raptor Lake [Intel Design Engineer], but I did have exposure to Alder Lake, and I can confirm that they were very concerned about the ring bus getting damaged if the voltage was pushed too high. I can also confirm that Raptor Lake was rushed through the design and validation process... Source 3: I [Intel Foundry Services] can tell you that Raptor Lake was rushed through our Fab in Arizona in record time, but it's also produced in other fabs. However, this location (Arizona) is notable because I can confirm that there was an Oxidation issue caused by some failure in our HVAC system between March & June of 2023. It was so bad that Keyvan Esfarjani had to fly in to make decision about which wafers (which cost as much as a Model X each) needed to be thrown away. To be clear, I don't know what decision was made, but I do know that this event DID happen. And by the way, it affected Sapphire Rapids yields as well...although I doubt it's an issue that wasn't",0.5221,NEGATIVE,0.9929

Yes while the main points of the short report were not mentioned and intel continues to hide this infomation from Investors, they cant ignore the impact it has on their bottom line. RMA's are not cheap and the amount of money and time they are spending to fix the issue for existing chips while trying their hardest to deny RMAs for failed CPUs. Customers have lost faith in Intel, their chips are constantly beaten by AMD offerings and having a high failure rate really was the last nail in the coffin. Enterprise customers are switching, gamers are switching, datacetners are switching. All switching to AMD (or Arm - Yes Arm is starting to see some enterprise deployments, very little tho.) Intel will continue to have bad earnings for the forseable future (as they guided), And they also havnt announced (and likly wont) the delay of their next gen CPUs (15000 series) for desktop, they are expected to announce only Mobile chips and act like Desktop and server CPUs dont exist this generation.

VSH - The Forgotten King of Chips.csv,"TLDR: $VSH (Vishay Intertechnology) is printing money while everyone sleeps on it. $VSH just got the stamp of approval from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, confirming it as a hidden winner in Nvidia’s AI and RTX 50 supply chain. With key wins in MOSFETs, capacitors, and resistors, $VSH is now primed for explosive growth, riding Nvidia’s dominance in AI servers and GPUs. If you’re not jacked up on $VSH, you’re not meant to have money. Who is $VSH? Vishay Intertechnology is a veteran in the electronics industry. They make essential components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and semiconductors. You know, the boring stuff that makes your GPU, PS5, and electric toothbrush actually work. They’ve been doing this since 1962. That’s right, this company has survived every market downturn, bubble, and chip shortage in the last 60+ years. Meanwhile, you can’t even survive a red day on SPY. Why $VSH is printing money: Chips are everywhere—cars, phones, smart homes, AI servers. The global semiconductor market is growing at an insane pace (projected $1 trillion market by 2030). Guess what? Vishay is supplying the guts. Look at their P/E ratio: 12.5 (as of last check). Compare that to Nvidia’s 75+ or AMD’s 30-ish. $VSH is practically trading at the bargain bin, and yet their revenues are consistently strong. Vishay’s last earnings report crushed expectations, with double-digit growth in several segments. They’re sitting on $3.4B in annual revenue with plans to scale. Oh, and they’re buying back shares like they’re on clearance at Costco. Everyone’s hyped about Nvidia because of AI. Guess what? Vishay supplies components used in AI hardware, EV charging stations, and industrial automation. While Nvidia makes the sexy GPUs, Vishay sells the boring but essential resistors and capacitors that keep those GPUs from melting your motherboard. They’re eating up the market share. Recent Catalysts: Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo dropped a bombshell: Vishay is a key supplier for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI servers (GB200 series, DGX/HGX B200) and the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. These are Nvidia’s future bread-and-butter products, dominating AI and high-end gaming. Vishay replaced Infineon as Nvidia’s MOSFET supplier. Yes, Infineon, the semiconductor giant, just got sidelined. This Is MASSIVE for $VSH. Vishay is providing MOSFET/DrMOS (VRPower), vPolyTan (Polymer Tantalum Capacitors), and Current Shunt Resistors. These components are critical for Nvidia’s most cutting-edge products: • GB200 series AI servers: Nvidia’s next-gen AI infrastructure. • RTX 50 series GPUs: The next flagship graphics cards. Vishay’s vPolyTan capacitors (especially the T55 series) are already facing a supply crunch for 2025. That’s how in-demand they are. Kuo estimates that Vishay’s MOSFET production alone will contribute 20%-30% of revenue by 2025—with above-average gross profit margins. The vPolyTan capacitors will add a high single-digit percentage of revenue with significantly above-average margins. Translation? Vishay is printing money. Vishay’s production lines are already at capacity through 2025. When your biggest challenge is meeting demand, you’re in a good spot. Beyond Nvidia, Vishay is also poised to benefit from: • Automotive rebound: As EV production scales, Vishay’s components are critical. • IoT growth: Billions of devices mean billions of tiny components. Vishay is at the center of it. The Stock Is Still Cheap Even after today’s 7% jump to $18.35, $VSH is wildly undervalued. As I said earlier, the P/E ratio is still around 12-13, compared to Nvidia’s 75+. This is a company with real earnings, real dividends, and real growth potential. This is a great opportunity to make back everything you lost from your MSTR calls. Positions: Shares, 01/17/25 20C",0.5352,POSITIVE,0.9824

"Weekly jobless claims fall to 233,000, less than expected, in a positive sign for labor market.csv","Last night, the U.S. announced that the number of initial unemployment claims for last week was 233,000, significantly lower than the previous week's 249,000 and also below the market's expectation of 240,000! A few days ago, Mr. Wang mentioned that for the U.S. stock market to stop declining, the economic and labor data released must continue to be strong in order to ease concerns about a potential economic recession. Yesterday's sharp drop in initial unemployment claims marked the largest decrease in a year, indicating that the number of people recently unemployed has decreased. This alleviated the recession concerns raised by last Friday's non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate data, spurring a rally in U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 index surging over 2.3%, the largest single-day gain in 21 months 📈. On the other hand, the demand for the 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds at the auctions over the past two days was poor, causing the 10-year yield to exceed 4% once again! Tech giants saw a broad rebound, with Meta rising 4.2%, Alphabet up 1.9%, Amazon gaining 1.8%, Apple increasing 1.6%, and Microsoft rebounding 1%. Nvidia surged over 6%, returning to the $100 mark, leading to a rebound in semiconductor stocks. Broadcom, Micron, and Applied Materials all jumped more than 6%, while Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and AMD all saw gains of over 5%! Taiwan's ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) also rebounded, with TSMC and UMC both jumping more than 6%, and ASE gaining over 4%. However, it's still important to note that the number of continuing unemployment claims is rising, reaching its highest level since November 2021, nearly three years ago! Therefore, Wall Street's foreign investors remain concerned about the economy. For example, JPMorgan still believes the U.S. economy will enter a recession, raising the probability from 25% to 35%!

Why I am going long on Intel and letting Bad Daddy Gelsinger take me to Uranus - DD TurboNerd Post.csv,"TLDR: This stock fucking sucks, and I love it. But the developing foundry business is gonna get absolutely bananas under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for the sole purpose of developing it. They are not gonna let the other chip companies continue to take nut shots on them and they are just gonna make everyone chips for them. Anyways I all in on Mar 2025 Calls (which are like $4.50 - $5.00) right now. Here is some DD. Dog of the Dow Intel has lagged behind other chip titans such as [[AMD - AMD]] and [[NVDA -NVIDIA]] as they race to design and build chips to handle [[AI]] workloads. Both AMD and NVIDA have seen tremendous growth over the past 18 months (as of June 2024). A growth pattern that has gone completely unanswered by INTEL up until this point. Looking at the [[Price to Earnings Ratio]] of both AMD and NVIDIA it is easy to see how disconnected from earnings they have become (though they are both incredibly profitable). AMD P/E Ratio: 67.30 NVIDIA P/E Ratio: 238.53 INTEL P/E Ratio 31.79 AMD is wildly inflated relative to its competition in the space. NVDA is has a more ""sane"" price to earnings but it has also been nearly printing its own money with the amount of sales it has been making. The price of NVIDIA still ""feels"" high despite it's recent split. Another interesting metric to take a look at is the [[Price/Tangible Book]] - Where you take the current price of the stock and compare it to the tangle value of all its assets minus good will. AMD P/TB Ratio: 23.61 NVIDIA P/TB Ratio: 64.73 INTEL P/TB Ratio: 1.75 This says a few things; One either Intel has barely any assets worth liquidating relative to its stock price and the market has priced the stock appropriately, OR the price of the stock is selling for a very reasonable price related to the actual value of the company. This could be considered paying only .75 above book value of the company as a ""premium"" for future expected value. Source: Any trading platform that has data you ding dongs - go look it up. I got these from Schwab jfc. Technical Except for this past Wednesday, this company has been hard stuck around $30 after a selloff from its 52 week high of $51.28. 31.50 appears to be the most reliable resistance level we can work off of right now, then $32.50 after that. If it breaks both of those on a run up, there is literally no ceiling until $46. SO, you tell me what that means. The further you zoom out on your shitty little trading app the more you will see that this period we are in is nothing but consolidation. Foundry Intel's new foundry business will be the corner stone of its future growth. Forget the in house made chips. The company is not-so-silently tyring to be the American version of TSMC. Here is an article they posted on their own site outlining their model. https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-outlines-new-financial-reporting-structure.html#gs.a8z07s Note this section: April 9th 2024 ""Intel Foundry is a newly established operating segment that includes foundry technology development, foundry manufacturing and supply chain, and foundry services (formerly IFS). Under this new structure, Intel Foundry will recognize revenues generated from both external foundry customers and Intel Products..."" Fuck me, if they pull this off under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for this specific function, this stock could easily moon. Not to mention this article detailing that NVIDIA will start using Intels Foundry to start making its own chips. https://www.techspot.com/news/101725-nvidia-turning-intel-foundry-services-expand-gpu-ai.html#:~:text=Nvidia%20could%20also%20choose%20to,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202024. Chips Act ""U.S. Department of Commerce has proposed up to $8.5 billion in direct funding through the CHIPS and Science Act to advance Intel’s commercial semiconductor projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon. Intel also expects to benefit from a U.S. Treasury Department Investment Tax Credit (ITC) of up to 25% on more than $100 billion in qualified investments and eligibility for federal loans up to $11 billion. Proposed funding supports Intel’s previously announced plans to invest more than $100 billion in the U.S. over five years to expand U.S. chipmaking capacity and capabilities critical to economic and national security and acceleration of emerging technologies, such as AI. Intel’s investments are expected to create more than 10,000 company jobs and nearly 20,000 construction jobs, and to support more than 50,000 indirect jobs with suppliers and supporting industries. "" https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/us-chips-act-intel-direct-funding.html#gs.a8z5ze So yea Intel is gonna get paid, and quite a bit. The article states that they are slated to receive up to $8.5 billion, with a B. X86 chips - Speculation With Arm taking dominance over portable computers like laptops, tablets and phones, X86 looks pretty boring. Except you have to remember that both AMD and Intel are still cranking these bad boys out like nobody's business. The raw horsepower in these for desktop workstations and servers is still not matched by ARM and probably wont be for quite a while. Sure they are not quite as power efficient, but who cares in a data center or major compute space anyways. Intel owns almost all of the IP for X86 processors too. AMD has a little bit and they have made improvements and designs of their own that they have been able to patent, but INTEL is the OG maker of these chips. Arm will probably continue to dominate the landscape, but they are the people who license their chips are going to need them made somewhere. They will have like two options. Intel or TSMC. China What happens when CHYNA pulls the trigger and takes over Taiwan. Where is everyone gonna have their chips made? Arizona, that's where. TSMC and Intel are both setting up MASSIVE Fabs there. So, when all the other chip companies get absolutely smoked I expect to see a giant green candle on that morning for INTC. I will probably write more later but this shit got way long way fast.

Why I bought Puts on MNST (Monster).csv,"Since Monster releases its earnings report after market, it’s time for some puts… or calls if you are based and want to inverse me Reason 1: High expectations - Current expectations for this quarterly are quite high.. Expected earnings per share are $0.452 as opposed to the $0.400 of a year ago . In this same light the market expects (has already priced in) a nearly 200 million dollar increase in revenue from the year prior.. Put quite simply these massive increases are already expected and priced in, and it’s much easier to fall short when expectations are this high Reason 2: Competition - PepsiCo is fighting hard for market share of the energy drink market and threw $550 million dollars for an 8.5% share of Celsius in 2022. Monster has already struggled to maintain market share versus Red Bull, which owns the largest portion of the energy drink market.. Now on top of this already stiff competition they have to deal with a whale like PepsiCo flooding the market with products like Rockstar and Celsius over time Reason 3: regulation- As more health focused initiatives take place in Europe and America, products like monster will face increased scrutiny, both from consumers and governments alike (regulations on certain contents). Reason 4: Even those who hit their goals have been getting smashed… AMD and Reddit- Now I get what you are thinking “what the heck do these companies have to do with monster”… and yea they have no direct relationship.. But even after surpassing their goals for this last quarter these companies have seen their value get smashed.. The market is being mad weird and bearish right now when it comes to earnings. So in essence this combined with reason 1 (the high goals they already have), means that I feel that the odds favor the Put/bear side Hope you enjoyed my presentation!!

"Why I think Intel is a Misunderstood, Undervalued Play – A Bet on 18A (+EV DD).csv","Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.",0.5307,NEGATIVE,0.9997

Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD & NVIDIA offerings. But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment. Currently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons. Microsoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in.

I don't do options so maybe this is the wrong place lmao. I moved back home to my parents place when my dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Truthfully this has been the worst year of my life (and his obviously) in a lot of ways, but I've been investing since I was 16 (I'm 25 now). My dad worked in equities, so when he lost his ability to communicate effectively with me (and since I had significantly more income because I'm not paying rent) - I truthfully went ballistic on investing. Pretty much said fuck it, I'm living at home I don't need a 6 month emergency fund till I move out and went all-in. Granted 40% of my portfolio not listed here is in a 401k account entirely in the S&P 500 (set & forget just in case my equities went to hell as with the rest of my life lol). I believe in the margin of safety when investing. I like to invest in high-quality companies that generate lots of cash as the backbone of my portfolio. Since 2021 (before my dad got this cancer shit), I spoke with him and he basically said just look at the fundamentals of a company and invest in growth companies that you think will be around in 5-10 years. I look for value within growth stocks (i know paradoxical). Some of my icons in investing are David Tepper & Michael Burry. Again below is all my own experience and reflects only my own views and are not a recommendation of my company (corporate. disclaimer). My portfolio is heavily weighted (85%) between several stocks: AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL (So fucking cheap r u kidding me sorry), NVDA, AMZN, AMD, CRM, COST, RIVN (RIP), AVGO, VOO (ik not a stock) <-- I know semi(s) are very cyclical but i believe in holding all of these companies for 5-10 years, so I don't have to worry about temp. earnings beats/misses etc. Much easier to pick a stock and hold it for a while then it is to get the timing right. Roughly at 175% return in the past 3 years. (hammered META at $100's, NVDA at $200 both in 2022) Roughly 15% of my bets are moonshots (note the word bet hehe) with promise but objectively could be overvalued/bad investments: CCL/RCL (both are crushing it and between them own 75% of the cruise line market), LCID/RIVN (going to 0 bc they can't scale profitably or will make u a very happy person 3 years down the line bc R2/Atlas at 45k/50k should capture a significant portion of model y demand), TTD, DKNG/FLUT - gambling hasn't even been legalized in Cali/Texas (the biggest markets in the U.S. come on), RBLX (feels like betting against youtube in the early innings w/o realizing how much rev. they're actually recognizing), PYPL (value - cheap af (bought at $60) should turn around in a couple years) I joke I allocate like google's budget where it's 90% bread&butter and the rest are moonshots. Was very depressed (still reasonably depressed) because I'm not sure how much time my dad has. I hope in a way I can pass some of these stocks to my kid in a better place than I found it.

Morgan Stanley anticipates that AMD's core business will ""accelerate meaningfully"" as the PC market continues to recover and server upgrades resume. The investment firm noted that AMD is likely to capture a disproportionate share of these larger projects as upgrades progress. AMD's increased Q3 revenue guidance of about $6.7 billion at the midpoint reflects ""strong momentum across compute businesses,"" according to Morgan Stanley. This momentum underscores the company's effective strategy and execution, positioning it well for sustained growth. Artificial intelligence is also expected to be a significant growth driver for AMD. The company's advancements in AI technology and its strategic roadmap place it in a favorable position to capitalize on the burgeoning AI market. While there are potential delays in the deployment of new AI silicon, the overall outlook remains robust. Morgan Stanley maintains an equal-weight rating on Advanced Micro Devices and has raised its price target to $178 from $176, reflecting confidence in the company's future performance. AMD's strategic positioning and continued execution of its roadmap suggest a promising trajectory.

AI chipmaker Cerebras files for IPO to take on Nvidia - But 87% of its revenues have come from the U.csv,"The Middle East wants chips badly but US restrictions prevent the US most powerful chips entering into certain geographical areas such as China and the Middle East; this entails the UAE. Nevertheless, the UAE wants in on the GPU chips craze and is apparently willing to pay anything to enter into the chip bonanza. The UAE can't get Nvidia's, AMD's, or Intel's best GPU chips so instead they are investing heavily into alternatives such as Cerebras. There is nothing inherently wrong with this but it's also the biggest red flag as an investment opportunity. If the agreements for Nvidia chips open up in the Middle East and specifically with the UAE that could be a crushing blow to this aspiring startup. Specifically, Cerebras Systems reported a net loss of $66.6 million for the first six months of 2024, on $136.4 million in revenue. For the same period in 2023 it has a net loss of $77.8 million on just $8.7 million in sales. 87% of this revenue for the first half of 2024 was directly from the UAE G42. The other red flag from this startup is the way in which they promote their business. It's all seemingly smoke and mirrors and conveniently based on outdated GPU pricing and throughput information; which is very publically available. For some reason, Groq and Cerebras love to keep using memory to unlock speeds on small/tiny models which is impractical and inefficient for a scaled system; or a system that is a large foundational LLM. As well, they have no clue what models will do next so it's a major after the fact architecture that uses llama because they have access to it. https://cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebras-inference-ai-at-instant-speed. A prime example of this is OpenAI's GPT-o1 model that uses reasoning in coordination with its model capabilities. Because they are not being used on the forefront of this technology they don't know how or when a model's size, function, or needs will evolve into the future. All of this plus the pricing from OpenAI and Microsoft is coming down exponentially. For Example: They are referring to a 70b param model that shoves an entire model onto memory. They are going up against h100's which is a very old technology at this point. They make no reference to h200's let alone blackwell Because they are referencing such a small model the pricing model they suggest would be radically different for a 400b param model and forget about trillion param models which are coming next. They're not being truthful about tokens per s. As of today this is Azure GPT 4o and GPT 4 mini tokens per minute gpt-4o & GPT-4 Turbo global standard Model Tier Quota Limit in tokens per minute (TPM) Requests per minute gpt-4o Enterprise agreement 30 M 180 K gpt-4o-mini Enterprise agreement 50 M 300 As you can clearly see 30 million tokens per minute is 500k tokens per second and mini is 833,333 tokens per second. So i don't know why they are referring to 20 tokens per second or their 450 tokens per second seems way off. maybe they mean million. Even if that is the case and 70 b would be more like mini it is way higher than their limit. On pricing which they lay out a 3:1 input versus output is fine the price would be for mini which is a comparable model is roughly .10 cents (input) + .20 cents = .30 cents. Per million. for regular 4o it would be higher and let's face it GPT 4o is a far superior model than llama 3.1 3.33 dollar + 5 = $8.33 Source: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/ From this information what I can tell you is that what we just went over is pricing. it is not some guarantee for what a model produces per second. That shit is very random. What I can tell you is from GPT 4 to GPT 4 turbo to Gpt 4o the speed is dramatically better. GPT 4o mini is damn near real time. Take that for what it's worth. I am not saying they're being dishonest here but I am saying they are being very cheeky with how they advertise things. The company is currently being primarily supported by the UAE, with investments worth roughly $900 million for new AI supercomputers known as the Condor Galaxy series. Any growth here is singular to this source of investment and not driven by organic growth or usage. This is not a competitor to Nvidia but rather a temporary solution in the Middle East until chip embargoes are alleviated. The media here loves to use sexy headlines on non-technical verifications of what it is they are actually comparing. I.e. H100's are now old, or The fact an entity may need to serve millions of clients... No they are instead reporting self-prompting headlines from Cerebras that say things like our chips are 20x faster than Nvidia. Live Update: As I am writing and researching this topic it has just been reported by Reuters that the U.S. is setting a new rule to allow chip shipments to the Middle East including the UAE which is a boon to Nvidia and Microsoft. US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East Here are couple excerpts: WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), to data centers in the Middle East. G42, a UAE-based AI company with historic ties to China, has been a focus of those concerns. In April, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), opens new tab announced that it would invest $1.5 billion in the company, with plans to provide G42 with chips and model weights, sophisticated data that improves an AI model's ability to emulate human reasoning.The deal drew scrutiny from China hardliners in Congress, even though G42 said in February that it had divested from China and was accepting constraints imposed on it by the United States to work with American companies. LOL you can't make this up. Literally this just got reported by Reuters today 9/30/2024. This completely aligns with my argument above regarding the UAE-G42. With chips now entering into the Middle East from Nvidia and potentially others I don't know how this startup IPO makes it off the ground. I don't mean to be bearish but I don't think this is the time for them to raise an IPO without showing more progress. I could be wrong. As of now, I don't plan on buying any shares. Instead, I will be adding more shares into Nvidia because now this is bullish news for Nvidia.",0.5441,NEGATIVE,1.0

AMD CEO Lisa Su Says AI Is In Early Stages Of Multiyear 'Supercycle' 'There's Tremendous Need For Mo.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) shares are experiencing an upward trend after the company reported strong second-quarter financial results. Following the announcement, CEO Lisa Su emphasized that the chipmaker’s performance is being driven by a multiyear AI “supercycle.” What To Know: Recently, chip stocks saw a sell-off as earnings season approached, with investors questioning the timeline for significant returns on the massive investments in AI. This led to speculation that spending on AI might slow down. However, early earnings reports indicate that capital expenditures have remained robust. Su’s comments on CNBC’s “Squawk On The Street” Wednesday provide reassurance against slowdown concerns. She stated, “From the conversations that I have with our customer set and sort of the broader industry, we can see that AI is a multiyear, you know, I would call it a supercycle frankly. There’s tremendous need for more compute.” AMD reported second-quarter revenue of $5.835 billion and adjusted earnings of 69 cents per share, surpassing analyst estimates as its AI business continues to see accelerating demand. The chipmaker also updated its forecast, expecting GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion this year, up from the previous forecast of more than $4 billion. Su highlighted that analysts and investors are “hypersensitive” to minor quarter-over-quarter changes. She believes that the AI story should be viewed in a broader context, suggesting that the demand is extraordinarily high. “I wouldn’t be hypersensitive in those areas ... Are more customers using it? Is every enterprise asking for it? Are we seeing more applications on a daily, weekly, monthly basis? The answer to that is absolutely yes,” she said. “Everywhere I go, everyone wants to talk about how can we incorporate AI into our businesses faster and more efficiently ... this early in the cycle, there’s a lot of learning and experimentation, but definitely, there will be the return on the investment on the other side,” Su added. Although the return on investment isn’t “instantaneous,” it’s occurring very quickly. AI is already boosting productivity and enabling companies to bring better products to market faster. Su emphasized, “We’re investing today for the return in a couple of years, and I think that’s absolutely the right thing to do. That’s the way to think about these investment cycles.” AMD’s strategic focus on AI and its strong financial performance underscore its robust position in the rapidly evolving technology landscape, highlighting the company’s potential for sustained growth in the coming years.",0.5537,NEGATIVE,0.8673

Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year. This report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure. With Nvidia's earnings report on the horizon, AMD's results offer a useful benchmark. Although AMD has significantly underperformed Nvidia year-to-date, this could be an opportunity to turn the tables. Data Center Growth is Key Analysts predict AMD's data center revenue will reach a record $3.52 billion for Q3. In July, CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in strong revenue growth for the year's second half, driven by demand for Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. Earlier this month, AMD launched its latest data center AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, and investors are keen to see its performance. Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari pointed to sustained growth in AI infrastructure capital expenditure, a recovery in server CPUs, and AMD's ongoing market share gains.

"Apple reportedly seeks to lock out its competitors from TSMC's 2nm process, by booking all of its ma.csv","Apple has long been cozy with TSMC, the manufacturer of the chips that end up in ever-popular iPhone, iPad and Mac products. When you've got as much cash on hand as Apple does, it puts it in a favorable position to negotiate deals with the Taiwan-based chipmaker. Now it is reportedly seeking to lock in 100% of TSMC's bleeding edge 2nm production capacity, giving it a competitive advantage when products eventually make their way to the market. According to 9to5mac (via Extreme tech), Apple's chief operating officer met with TSMC bosses to negotiate terms to secure 2nm capacity. The report cites 'local sources', so there needs to be a pinch of salt here, but given Apple's track record of locking up TSMC's capacity, this would certainly come as no surprise. TSMC's 2nm process is currently scheduled to enter risk production in 2025, with volume production set for the second half of 2025. That means the upcoming iPhone 16 family with A18 chips will stick with 3nm, but it could mean the high end iPhone 17 Pro and Max could be the first in line to be built with 2nm technology. The specifics of deals between TSMC and its customers are obviously not made public, but it is widely accepted that Apple booked all of TSMC's 3nm capacity, at least for a period of time. These chips, including the A17 and M3 families made their way into the latest generation iPhone 15 Pros and MacBooks. That would make Apple's 2nm play unsurprising. It's easy to see why Apple would attempt to secure the maximum amount of 2nm capacity. It will give it an advantage over its competitors, as 2nm chips will allow Apple to pack in more transistors into a given area, leading to better performance or lower power consumption—if not both. Samsung has its own manufacturing capacity, and future Exynos chips will be built in-house, but 2nm Snapdragon and possibly Google Tensor chips may have to wait in line behind Apple. Even mega-companies such as Google and Qualcomm don't have the cash on hand to outbid big daddy Apple. It's not just Arm competitors that will be disadvantaged. Nvidia will want every possible power and performance advantage it can get as it dominates the market for AI processors, while AMD will also have to wait for access to the best nodes. Even Intel could find itself at a disadvantage given some of the tiles for its chips are manufactured by TSMC.

"BEARISH NVDA Development Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Intel developing open standard AI Accelerator .csv","Full Article: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-giants-form-industry-group-120000567.html NVDA's current GPU (AIPU) market domination currently stands at 85-95% of the accelerator market. This is pushing profit margins to extreme levels, protected by a moat defended by CUDA and their consistent R&D in the space, leading to further chip advancements along inference and power efficiencies at a much faster pace than their competitors (AMD/INTEL in particular). This new open standards alliance (UALink Promoter Group) for the interconnect (a.k.a backbone) of server clusters challenges NVDA's own proprietary interconnect systems, but will likely not be able to compete with the new B200 line being delivered in the coming months, due to its extreme efficiencies across GPUs and clusters. However, this new alliance is interesting, and combined with the hyperscalers consistently developing in-house specialized chips for model training and inferences, we will likely see a gradual decrease of market domination over the next 2-5 years. Overall, this seems like a BEARISH development for NVDA",0.5448,POSITIVE,0.9841

Bloomberg Again Reports on Semiconductors With Flimsy Information on Secret Government Contacts.csv,"Usually, when things that are leaked with an intention the entity where the leak comes from is pleased with said leak. Not for Bloomberg though. Bloomberg actually accomplishes citing an anonymous source about on ongoing discussions related to chip distribution and subsequently takes that information to the White House National Security Council to ask them to comment. Here is the WHNSC's response. Bloomberg: US Weighs Capping Exports of AI Chips From Nvidia and AMD to Some Countries A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the talks but pointed to a recent joint statement by the US and UAE on artificial intelligence. In it, the two countries acknowledged the “tremendous potential of AI for good,” as well as the “challenges and risks of this emerging technology and the vital importance of safeguards.” The council responds with a no comment while directing them to a positive statement. To me, this greatly diminishes whomever the Bloomberg contact is. This is the second time that Bloomberg goes out of their way citing a leaky government source that on it's own merits isn't really that sensational at all. The headline is sensational the reality is not. The approach would set a ceiling on export licenses for certain countries in the interest of national security, according to the people, who described the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Officials are focused on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing appetite for AI data centers and the deep pockets to fund them, the people said. This isn't even news. Reuters reported on this a month ago with a much more neutral to positive tone. Which it is. Reuters: US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia to data centers in the Middle East.Since October 2023, U.S. exporters have been required to obtain licenses before shipping advanced chips to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.Under the new rule, data centers will be able to apply for Validated End User status that will allow them to receive chips under a general authorization, rather than requiring their U.S. suppliers to obtain individual licenses to ship to them. If you're tracking, this simply seems to be the 2nd half of that original conversation. There are already chip restrictions. Nvidia is already not delivering the most advanced chips to those countries. The framework proposed would allow Nvidia to deliver chips under certain restrictions and guidelines. Bloomberg acknowledges this towards the tail end of the article. While officials have debated the best approach, they’ve slowed high-volume AI chip license approvals to the Middle East and elsewhere. But there are signs things could get moving soon: Under the new rules for shipments to data centers, US officials will vet and preapprove specific customers based on security commitments from both the companies and their national governments, paving the way for easier licensing down the road. What I don't understand is why does Bloomberg like to make things salacious when they're seemingly not. There is 0 chips to parts of the Middle-East today, but the U.S. government is working on a framework that may relieve that. Reuter story from a month ago. The end. When you read the headline one would believe that they are already selling these chips to the UAE and they're not.",0.5344,NEGATIVE,1.0

For the US and European AI Software Sector the restrictions should be regarded as good news, because with less systems being sold abroad, they won't have to wait that long for their orders.

Could PLTR go on a TSLA-like Run (70%) if Included in SP500.csv,"On June 7th, S&P 500 is set to rebalance and Palantir will be eligible for the third time. With the spotlight on AI and Palantir's continued strong performance, there's a very high likelihood it is included in the S&P, which could lead PLTR going on a Tesla-like run. First, let me break down why Palantir is a great candidate for inclusion. Inclusion in the S&P 500 index involves meeting several stringent criteria related to market capitalization, liquidity, financial viability, and corporate governance. For Palantir Technologies (PLTR) to be considered a good candidate for S&P 500 inclusion, it must satisfy these key requirements: Market Capitalization: A company must have a market cap of at least $14.6 billion (as of 2023). Palantir's market capitalization has been above this threshold for a while. Liquidity: Companies need to have adequate liquidity, with a high trading volume. Palantir's shares are actively traded, reflecting strong investor interest and sufficient liquidity. Financial Viability: The company must report positive earnings in the most recent quarter and over the last four quarters combined. Palantir has demonstrated profitability, reporting positive GAAP EPS in recent quarters (InvestorPlace). U.S. Based: Companies must be U.S.-based, with the majority of their assets and revenues derived from the U.S. Palantir fits this criterion, being headquartered in Denver, Colorado, and deriving significant revenue from U.S. operations. Public Float: At least 50% of a company's shares must be in the public float. Palantir's public float percentage is adequate to meet this requirement, with substantial institutional ownership indicating wide distribution among public shareholders Palantir meets all the eligibility criteria, the only which could be a problem is corporate governance, ie, the insiders own a lot of shares of the company; however there are tons of examples of other companies that have a similar structure. As many of you know, Tesla went on a 70% in the weeks leading up to and the month following its inclusion. However, it's not alone. Many other ""sexy/high-profile"" names go on epic runs when SP500 inclusion is announced. Twitter (TWTR) Inclusion Date: June 7, 2018 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $26 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on May 21, 2018, Twitter's stock increased by approximately 14%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, Twitter's stock increased by about 5%. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2019 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2019, NXP's stock rose by approximately 10%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, NXP's stock increased by around 6%. AMD (Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.) (AMD) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2017 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $20 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2017, AMD's stock increased by approximately 12%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, AMD's stock rose by around 9%. T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS) Inclusion Date: June 22, 2020 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on June 5, 2020, T-Mobile's stock increased by approximately 8%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, T-Mobile's stock saw an increase of about 7%. NVIDIA (NVDA) Inclusion Date: November 18, 2001 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $25 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: NVIDIA's stock saw a significant rise, roughly around 20-25%, in the weeks leading up to the inclusion. Month Following Inclusion: The stock continued to perform well, with an additional increase of around 10-15%. ""S&P 500 effect,"" is a real phenomenon and I think it's even more powerful with high-profile names like Palantir. As mentioned earlier, Tesla went on a god-like run in the weeks leading up to and after the announcement. And I think Palantir shares many characteristics with Tesla that may see it go on a similar run. Both companies have a very high-profile CEO. Alex Karp is loved by Palantir holders just like Elon is by Tesla fanboys, which leads to my most important point: retail ownership. Palantir has a significant amount of its shares outstanding owned by retail; if SP500 inclusion is announced and institutions have to buy shares it may create a similar move like Tesla's as most palantir fanboys won't sell. Like Tesla, they believe Palantir is changing the world (look at their subreddit). I think buying Palantir options is a great upside play with limited downside, depending on when you purchase your options. The inclusion announcement is on Friday after hours, so you could buy Friday before close or anytime this week and sell Monday morning if its not included for a minimum loss. And with options being so cheap, this could be a 50-bagger if it goes to 30 bucks. 6/21 23 C 6/21 25 C.",0.5557,POSITIVE,0.7174

How Terrifying is the Start of August.csv,"Just over the past three trading days, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 indices have all recorded their largest three-day cumulative decline since June 2022! Last night, the Nasdaq plummeted by over 6% at one point, and the S&P 500 dropped by more than 4%, with both indices returning to their early May levels by the close of trading. Although the major U.S. indices and individual stocks still closed with significant losses, the intraday declines were somewhat moderated. The primary reason for this was the release of the U.S. July ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, which rebounded from a four-year low in June to 51.4, exceeding market expectations and returning to the expansion zone above 50! Sub-indices, including the New Orders Index and Employment Index, also showed growth. Notably, the Employment Index reached 51.1, marking the largest increase since September of last year and the first time this year that it has entered the expansion zone above 50. This data slightly alleviated fears from last week's significant non-farm payroll decline, making the market believe that the drop in new jobs was primarily due to Hurricane Barry hitting Texas. 👉 As discussed previously, the sharp decline in U.S. stocks at the start of August stemmed from worries about the U.S. economy falling into recession. Therefore, when the ISM Non-Manufacturing number showed growth yesterday, it somewhat restored market confidence in the economy, helping to narrow the intraday losses of U.S. stocks. The U.S. stock market now needs to see positive economic growth news to recover, unlike before when everyone was hoping for bad news, anticipating a Federal Reserve interest rate cut! Hence, it is crucial to continue monitoring other economic data. If strong and robust growth numbers do not consistently appear, investors will remain concerned about an economic recession, and the trend of selling stocks for cash will not end. The VIX Fear Index is a crucial indicator to observe market sentiment calming down.

I wait all year for this opportunity - now I'm going to share it with you.csv,"If you trade long enough, you begin to see patterns emerge. On October 30th, one of my favorite patterns is starting. If you buy AMD stock on the last Monday of October, the average return for the rest of the year is 24.52%, and the stock is higher 88.89% of the time. This data starts in 2015 because it is the first full year after Dr. Lisa Su became CEO of AMD. Some of you may be wondering why this period is so strong for AMD stock. Let me share my personal theory. AMD depends on TSMC for chip manufacturing. Taiwan is protected by its geography and weather, but the Chinese have two windows of opportunity to cross the Strait with favorable weather. The first is from late March to the end of April. The second is from late September to late October. Last year, China launched major military exercises around Taiwan in April. This year, they did it in October, which just ended a few days ago. (They also launch these exercises when they are provoked, such as when Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan or during the recent Taiwanese elections.) In my view, the end of October triggers a relief rally in stocks related to TSMC, most notably AMD and Nvidia. This combines with earnings and strong seasonality, resulting in massive outperformance in a relatively short period of time. A quick word of warning—this time period includes earnings.

In INTC I trust.csv,"I've shifted my entire S&P 500 holdings into Intel, and here's why: The AI Revolution: NVIDIA currently dominates the AI technology landscape, and that’s indisputable. Their unmatched tech and visionary leadership have set the bar high. However, with the U.S. aiming to maintain its global leadership, relying on a single company for AI tech could become a security risk and a bottleneck in innovation. Why Intel Could Be the Game-Changer? Intel (INTC) is uniquely positioned to disrupt NVIDIA's monopoly. Alongside AMD, Intel possesses the expertise and resources needed to engineer AI chips. Enter Gaudi 3. If Gaudi 3 lives up to the hype, Intel’s stock could potentially skyrocket, doubling in value in a matter of months hands down. Government Backing: The U.S. government and major institutions are already showing their support for Intel, recognizing its strategic importance in the tech race. Positive Vibes: Reviews for Intel's Arrow Lake architecture are rolling in with strong positives, indicating that Intel's on the right track to regain dominance.

INTC - A dumb person's retrospective.csv,"I'm lazy and you regards don't like to read so I'll leave it to bullet points and you can piece them together. Intel was seen as a bargain in 2023 compared to NVDA and AMD after their 400% run up. US gov have vested interest in Intel. No they are not propping Intel up, but it's effectively giving Intel a big loan to buy a second house. That loan can pay off if the housing market goes up, or they are double fucked because they leveraged to buy a second house. If you bought Intel because china will invade Taiwan, you are really regarded. If China invades Taiwan, everything is going to sell. That's a disruption of global trade on WW2 levels. Your best case scenario still loses you money. Intel bullish scenario is 18A, High-Na EUV paying dividends, early experience granting them a year technological lead over TSMC. It doesn't have to work, but the upside is a 10x from these levels. TSMC pass up High NA EUV is repeating the same decision Intel did in 2012 when Intel controlled the market and did not view EUV as economically feasible. Again, doesn't mean TSMC is incorrect in their assessment, but history does repeat itself. Intel bearish scenario is just repeat of 2016 and delay after delay. In which case they head to legacy company status like Ford. Anyone else remember all the Ford bulls in 2016? They're not on this sub anymore because they all went broke. I'm no crayon guy.

The investment only somewhat paid off in 2018 when AMD traded to 30, but then half the regards lost everything (myself included) when it crashed to 18 in 2 months following Powell's rate hike. Look how quickly sentiment changed for AMD from 2018. This very well could be history repeating itself, as the semiconductor companies have demonstrated over and over again. Intel 18A is a repeat situation of AMD ZEN. The upside cannot be understated. I'm still bullish. Proper execution can bring the company to a $200+ stock.

Intel - Pinnacle of failure.csv,"Intel's Slippery Slope: Financial Woes, Investor Distrust, and Leadership Issues Intel Corporation, once a dominant force in the tech industry, is now grappling with a series of significant challenges that have fueled a troubling decline. Despite attempts to project a positive outlook, the company’s current trajectory suggests a troubling downward spiral. Financial Performance and Market Challenges Intel's financial performance has continued to deteriorate. For the first half of 2024, Intel reported revenues of $24 billion, marking a slight decrease compared to previous periods. This decline is occurring amid a broader tech sector recovery and highlights Intel’s struggle to maintain its competitive edge. The company's net income for this period was a mere $800 million, translating to a profit margin of approximately 3.3%, indicating substantial operational inefficiencies and intense competition from rivals such as AMD and NVIDIA. Declining Customer Satisfaction and Product Concerns Customer dissatisfaction remains a critical issue. The release of Intel's 14th Gen Core processors has not addressed the performance inconsistencies that plagued previous models. While the company has introduced new features, reviews suggest that these updates have not significantly improved reliability or performance compared to competitors. This ongoing issue is eroding customer trust and impacting market share. Eroding Investor Confidence Investor confidence in Intel is faltering. The recent involvement of Apollo Global Management has raised concerns, particularly following Apollo’s controversial investment decisions in other sectors. Additionally, a recent lawsuit filed by major institutional investors alleges mismanagement and failure to deliver on key performance promises. This legal battle has further shaken confidence, prompting several large investors to divest from Intel, exacerbating the company's financial strain. Leadership and Legal Troubles Intel's leadership is facing intense scrutiny. Recent high-profile exits, including the departure of several senior executives, have led to a perception of instability at the top. The company's reliance on legal strategies to address its challenges, rather than focusing on operational and strategic improvements, appears to be aggravatinh its difficulties. This reactive approach is not addressing the underlying issues affecting Intel’s performance. Future Prospects and Potential Downturn Intel’s future prospects remain uncertain. Despite a significant $15 billion R&D budget, the company’s progress in key areas like AI and autonomous driving lags behind that of its more agile competitors. Moreover, while short-term production issues in Taiwan have provided some temporary relief, these are unlikely to reverse the long-term downward trend. The competitive landscape continues to evolve rapidly, and Intel’s slower adaptation could hinder its recovery prospects. TL;DR Intel’s current strategy, which includes overhauling its product lineup and executive team, appears to be a desperate attempt to stabilize its position. For investors and stakeholders, the warning signs are clear: Intel’s challenges are substantial, and the company’s efforts to turn things around may not be sufficient in the face of ongoing and evolving issues.

Intel is a good buy.csv,"We are all well aware Intel is having it's own Boeing moment right now with design flaws in their CPUs and horrible customer service. They deserve the steaming pile dooky that is currently sitting atop their share value. That being said, they have an ace that may flip the entire market on it's head: They own their fabs. That's right: all the other big boys in town design and give their blueprints for TSMC to manufacture. That's true of AMD, Nvidia, and other ARM and mobile chip designers. Intel is the only large scale chip designers that is more or less vertically integrated. As you may know, they just got $8.8B from papa Biden to build more foundries in Ohio and Arizona, in addition to their other sites across the world. None of this is particularly noteworthy until you consider that China has always been very interested in Chinesing Taiwan, and are even more so now that they have been embargoed from Nvidia chips by the US. The Chinese military build-up over the past decade has focused heavily on amphibious warfare, and long range anti-naval weapons (think carrier buster ballistic/boost-glide stand off weapons.) It doesn't take a Ph.D in geopolitics to understand what the move is here. On the US/allied side, the discourse around Taiwan has slowly shifted: what started out as ""we have overwhelming force and we will stop any attempt at an invasion of Taiwan"" has become something like ""Maybe we can't stop them from invading, but we can make it a Pyrrhic victory"". This may actually be the case, but the trend is not great. You will have noticed Taiwan has been increasingly politically isolated, mirroring the growing Chinese military power in the region. So what happens to TSMC if Taiwan gets Chinesed? As you can imagine, China is interested in acquiring as many TSMC assets and personnel intact as possible. This means you can bet your degenerate bacon that US intelligence services have contingencies to extradite key scientists and engineers, and scuttle the production plants and machines before the Chinese can take control of them. But the result is easy to predict: no more TSMC. This means the personnel extradited will be used to advise and run US production plants owned by, you guessed it: Intel. Intel will have a quasi monopoly on chip manufacturing. The US government see this of course, that's why they are strongly nudging Nvidia to play nice with Intel, because they see a potential future where Intel is the only player in town capable of making Nvidia chips, or any consumer chips at all for that matter, in the West.

Intel is a pretty safe bet and are undervalued.csv,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs. An additional benefit is that Intel can leverage their fabs in order to achieve higher margins for their own products. It's possible Intel's stock could be hit again in a month or so when their report comes out, but they are likely already at bottom.",0.5493,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Is INTC undervalued .csv,"Valuation Analysis of Intel Corporation Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has long been a key player in the semiconductor industry, but recent market developments and the rise of competitors like AMD and Nvidia have caused its stock to significantly underperform relative to its peers. As of Q2 2024, Intel’s total assets amount to approximately $182 billion, with liabilities around $91 billion, resulting in a net asset value of $91 billion. Yet, its market capitalization is around $95 billion, reflecting an almost 1:1 ratio between market cap and net assets. In contrast, competitors such as AMD and Nvidia trade at significantly higher premiums, indicating that the market may be underpricing Intel’s growth potential. Company Market Cap (Billion $) Net Assets (Billion $) Price to Net Asset Ratio Intel 95 91 1.04 AMD 266 56.5 4.71 Nvidia 3,000 58.15 51.58 Understanding Intel’s Valuation The Price to Net Asset Ratio (P/NAV) is a critical measure of how the market values a company relative to its net assets. Intel's current P/NAV of 1.04 reveals that its market value is nearly identical to its net assets, a valuation that appears surprisingly low, particularly when compared to its competitors. AMD and Nvidia, for instance, demonstrate P/NAV ratios of 4.71 and 51.58, respectively. This significant gap highlights the possibility that Intel is undervalued, especially given its strong fundamentals and growth potential. Several factors support this assessment. Despite facing fierce competition, Intel remains a leader in the semiconductor industry, known for its quality and innovation. The company is making substantial investments in new technologies and manufacturing capabilities, positioning itself to capitalize on growing trends such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, Intel boasts a robust balance sheet, with total assets of about $182 billion and liabilities around $91 billion. This financial strength provides a solid foundation for future growth and strategic initiatives. Although the recent decision to lay off 15,000 employees might seem concerning, it is part of a broader strategy to enhance operational efficiency and focus on core competencies, enabling Intel to adapt more effectively to evolving market demands. A key factor influencing Intel's future is the increasing global demand for semiconductors. As technology becomes more integrated into daily life, the need for high-performance chips continues to rise. Intel's resources and commitment to innovation position it to capture a larger share of this expanding market. Moreover, government support for the semiconductor industry adds another layer of potential upside for Intel. Given the strategic importance of semiconductor manufacturing in light of global supply chain challenges, particularly concerning the Taiwan-China situation, there is growing interest from government entities to bolster domestic semiconductor production. This focus on strengthening local supply chains can create favorable conditions for Intel, as it could receive both financial incentives and regulatory support to expand its operations and enhance its competitive positioning. Conclusion In summary, Intel Corporation is significantly undervalued based on its current P/NAV ratio. The company possesses strong assets, a history of innovation, and a strategic focus on future technologies. As Intel continues to execute its strategic plans and navigate market challenges, it has substantial potential to regain its competitive edge and achieve remarkable growth. Furthermore, the increasing government interest in supporting semiconductor manufacturing amid geopolitical uncertainties enhances Intel's prospects. The market's current valuation does not adequately reflect Intel's true value and growth potential, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

It's like saying my local grocery store doesn't use Nvidia chips. Emojis' don't need H100's.

Long-time AMD Holder (Cost Basis 1904) Starting to Sell - Anyone Else Disappointed in the Stock in 2.csv,"Wrote about my thinking below... Out of the 31 large banks, 25 have a “buy” rating and 6 have a “hold” rating on AMD 0.29%↑. It’s hard to think about why to sell when everyone is telling you to buy, but I am of the opinion that is when it should be most deeply considered. image credit to tipranks.com AMD has been my most profitable investment of the past 5 years, having risen 800% since purchased in August of 2018. For most investors (including myself), it’s difficult to part with winners. Not only that, I am someone who believes AI will proliferate throughout society in the coming years. Because they design data center GPUs, AMD should be one of the primary beneficiaries as the AI boom continues. It might seem counter-intuitive then to sell the stock here, but that is what I’ve begun doing over the past two weeks. I had high hopes for AMD this year, but it’s my view that they've failed to take significant data center GPU market share from Nvidia, and will have increased competition from Intel's new product offerings (on both client and data center), as well as proprietary silicon from large cloud players (Google, Amazon, etc). My original thesis was that AMD would profit from overextended Nvidia margins in 2024, but this underestimated the CUDA ecosystem moat that existed with Nvidia data center products (see Why I Got Nvidia Wrong). While most large cloud players want to diversify at least somewhat from Nvidia, they are still unable to do so without risking a competitive advantage with their own AI offerings. Add Intel into the mix, and the margin and market share pressure will be on AMD. The only player in the silicon value chain I think which can currently raise margins is TSMC (TSM 2.61%↑), but the geopolitical risk is too high for me to continue holding the stock (I sold my TSMC stake two weeks ago). On the PC (personal computer), Nvidia has always had a strong moat. It’s not just because they have the best performing products, but also because game developers are economically incentivized to optimize first (and often only) for the largest potential audience. This is similar to the moat CUDA protects on the data center side. One might think that Nvidia charging incredibly high prices for discrete graphics cards would cause them to lose share to AMD with consumers who directly purchase the products (as opposed to businesses who purchase the data center products). Yet Nvidia market share has only grown over the past few years. Data from Jon Peddie Research Why This Take Could Be Wrong: There is a lot of bullish momentum in the investor community around AMD currently from both professional commentators and retail investors (e.g. Twitter / X). Many people who had never heard of AMD 5 years ago are now saying to put money into the stock as it is Nvidia’s only pure AI competitor. As a result of this, AMD could see a dramatic rise on a positive earnings report later this month. In addition, I expect gaming revenues to surprise to the upside with the minor refresh of Xbox and Playstation consoles coming for holiday season. I still have ~260 shares of AMD remaining, and will likely hold to see if the stock jumps on the report. I think that AMD is extremely stretched in its current valuation (P/E of 205), and that any bad news could send it spiralling. Selling half of the remaining stake now is essentially a hedge against this possibility. Whatever happens with the earnings report, I will likely reduce my AMD holdings to zero in the next few months as I continue to lower exposure to companies reliant on Taiwan.",0.5591,NEGATIVE,0.9976

Wells Fargo ($WFC) must face a lawsuit over sham job interviews Rate Cut Countdown — Will the Fed Finally Pull the Trigger? Nope, the Fed isn’t cutting rates this week. But don’t snooze just yet—this meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn’t overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy—he's searching for that ""just right"" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same. Inflation: Cooling Off Inflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year’s 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the ""last mile"" of inflation reduction. The message? We’re on the right track, folks. Unemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it’s taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell’s recent take? The labor market isn’t adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a “sweet spot”—balancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals. Risk Management Reboot With inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed’s risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle—slightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed’s past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they’re determined to act promptly to avoid a recession. Some Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it’s time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn’t seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first. The Fed’s balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31. McDonald’s: The Golden Arches Stumble By the Numbers Revenue: $6.49 billion (missed $6.61 billion estimate) Earnings per Share: $2.97 (missed $3.07 estimate) Same-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020) U.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7% International Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1% International Franchised Sales: Down 1.3% McDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening. Value Meals to the Rescue The fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn’t translated into higher overall sales just yet. Internationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk. Defying the Odds Announcing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away. Despite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a ""buy"" and none recommending a sell. Looking Forward The golden arches are taking a ""forensic approach"" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales. So, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future. On The Horizon Tomorrow Economic Data and Earnings This week is buzzing with key economic data, especially on the employment front. Tomorrow, we'll get the June JOLTS report, which stands for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. This report measures job openings, hirings, and separations (like firings and retirements), offering a detailed snapshot of the U.S. job market. The May report surprised everyone with an unexpected increase in job openings, suggesting a stronger labor market. This might just be the signal the Fed needs to consider rate cuts sooner than expected. Earnings season is heating up, and the first of the Magnificent Seven stocks reports tomorrow after the close.

Microsoft’s Cloud Rain on Earnings Parade In a classic case of “so close, yet so far,” Microsoft ($MSFT) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, only to see its stock plummet over 5.79% in after-hours trading. Why? Investors fixated on the company’s disappointing Azure cloud revenue. Earnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints Microsoft’s revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure’s performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue—just shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub’s impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn’t enough to quell investor concerns. By the Numbers Revenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected Market Reaction and Future Outlook While the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft’s other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure’s growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn’t enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft’s shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500’s 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market’s laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters. Chips Ahoy! AMD’s Data Center Sales Surge 115% AMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let’s break it down. Earnings Breakdown AMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street’s expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter AI Chips and Data Center Dominance The tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company’s overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast. Other Segments and Market Reaction While the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD’s business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year AMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high. On The Horizon Tomorrow’s labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let’s be honest, they’re all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week’s job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes. Before Market Open Boeing ($BA): Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels.

My Analysis on ARM Holdings 2 Trillion+ Valuation.csv,"I believe ARM Holdings is slept on! I believe it could be the next NVIDIA. As of this writing its Market Cap is sitting at $142.36 Billion. I believe that its market cap should be ATLEAST 1 trillion due to the fact that it has an enormous market share of damn near if not more of 95% of the worlds smart device chips. What makes ARM unique is its business model. Their primary source of revenue is from the leasing of the design of the instruction set of computer chips. For those who dont know the instruction set is often referred to as an instruction set architecture (ISA), is a group of commands for a CPU in machine language. These commands tell the processor what operations to perform. Each instruction in the set specifies a particular operation to be performed on a specified set of data operands. The instruction set is fundamental to the design and functionality of computer chips, dictating how software communicates with hardware... So what is unique about this? Well I will tell you, these instruction sets are incredibly energy effecient compared to what is used currently for AI such as RISC or X86 etc. Currently NVIDIA is soaring because of the AI craze and its success has put light onto AMD, INTEL, SMCI etc but I believe ARM is a sleeper in my opinion. Their main source on revenue is through the royalties it recieves for leasing its designs. They can easily raise the royalty rate to increase their revenue stream anytime but there are some downsides. There customers could leave them and use other options. I dont think that is going to happen because lets face it their intellectual property is far better than any of the competition in terms of effeciency. AI is growing rapidly and one key expense is going to be energy consumption. Especially in these data centers. To my knowledge most data centers run on chips that use x86 from Intel. Those chips using that instruction set uses alot of energy. I believe data centers are looking to convert to a more energy effecient chip and when they do.... ENTER: ARM. Arm is currently used in almost all smart devices because again they are energy effecient. Why do we have longer battery life in a smart phones? Its because of ARM. What chips do electric cars use? ARM what instruction set does your microwave, fridge, washing machine use? ARM. Currently ARM is all over the portable device market but once they hit the data centers I believe there revenue is going to explode and therefore the market cap. There are major catalysts going down right now such as Microsoft partnering with them to make ARM based laptops and NVIDIA collaborating with them to make computers, not to mention that Tesla ordered a ton of NVIDIA chips that use ARM architecture. But my most bullish thing about ARM is what Jensen Huang said at Computex. He said that AI will eventually become physical in terms of robotics. Do you think those robotics need a energy sucker of a computerchip instruction set? No, the need the most energy effecient tech in todays age and that where ARM steps up right again. Currently we only use AI remotely (Chat GPT, Picture Generators, Etc.) but once we put AI into something physical and tangible such as robots to do everyday tasks those devices and robots need to run on the most advance and effecient software. I am currently looking at an outlook of 5-15 years and I am long on my position is this stock. We all seen what nvidia did and can only imagine what the next stock can yield the same returns and I think its ARM Holdings. Imagine going back to 2017 and investing into NVIDIA when the markect cap was the same as ARM now. Those returns look nice right if you have invested then. The time is now. Please keep in mind that i have not decided to go completely in depth of all of my research on ARM Holdings so please do your own. Also, I purposefully did not go into fundementals such as earnings and revenue on this. This is just my personal long term outlook on the research I have done. There are plenty more catalysts and risks out there so please DYOR. Feel free to comment!",0.5404,POSITIVE,0.9991

But here we are still FOMO'ing calls and short dated puts that would only print 1/1000 times. Over the past few days 3 mag 7 earnings all tanked and here we are. AMD? CPUs Good for gamers and graphics cards for poors. Pennies compared to $NVDA. $NVDA has a monopoly on AI software like $ASML has a monopoly on lithography and $TSM has a monopoly on chip production. $TSLA obviously seemingly doomed. Google can't take your cookies anymore, advertising revenue down MoM. Wanna get cucked by the zuck? I'm tempted to donate $1 to people wanting to buy $META calls at this point. TLDR: This looks like the same pattern we have had in 2022 and 2023 when markets take a downturn through mid-late October. Look at the previous years. I posted last week about the last 4 septembers being red. It looks like we are in another downturn. Earnings indicates it. I don't think CPI and PCE will save us this week. I'm scrounging up 25k waiting for the correction / dip / crash and buying SHARES so i never waste so much of my lifetime just to lose money speculating with options. Will post my realized losses if you think I'm BS. Thanks for reading this or just the TLDR. Looking forward to discussion!",0.5416,NEGATIVE,0.9998
My thesis on INTC going into 2025.csv,"I am going to add my technological and geopolitical fundamentals here, because I think these are going to be important factors heading into 2025. Disclaimer: I own 575 shares of Intel at an average PpS of $29.30 I think most analysts are forgetting that the next president is the same guy who is trying to block the acquisition of US steel by Nippon steel at all costs, regardless if it makes financial sense or not because he wants to retain as much American Manufacturing as possible and wants it to succeed. Most of the ""AI revolution"" has happened over the past 4 years where the administration had no problem letting foreign chip manufacturing take the lead. Intel is competing with TSMC, and TSMC receives massive subsidies and discounts from the Taiwanese government which dwarf the 7.9B (which was even reduced) from the US government. On top of that, the US government is also giving slightly less in subsidies, 6.6B, to TSMC to build in the US. So really, the current administration is not giving Intel an advantage over TSMC. The most effective thing that they could do is levy tariffs against Taiwan, which the next president has gone on record stating he wishes to do, instead of subsidies. This would increase demand for American chip manufacturing; while TSMC can manufacture in the US, CoWoS packaging is done outside of the US, in either Malaysia or Taiwan, and would cause the product to be subject to tariffs. In the chip design space, Intel is hopelessly behind on GPUs compared to Nvidia, and now Apple, Amazon, OpenAI and others are designing their own chips and using TSMC for manufacture. Intel still dominates the CPU space, but your average datacenter rack might have 10/20+ GPUs for each CPU. AMD is also a viable alternative to Intel for CPUs, and as such takes about 25% of the market. Intel's only way to compete in the GPU space is in the cost performance market, which mainly targets budget gaming, crypto mining, and cheap datacenter. The newest release of the ""Battlemage"" B580 is expected to compete with Nvidia's 4060 at the under $300 MSRP market, which are lofty goals. Nvidia and AMD still have offerings in these spaces but they are not lucrative ones. So Intel is basically competing to be a 3rd rate designer in the US, while they still have the CPU lead it matters a lot less for the lucrative markets right now. It's clear that on the design front, Intel is not going to receive much help to be successful. While this is their core business and majority of revenue, it is a business they are falling behind substantially compared to others. Design demand is GPUs and they are late to this party. Revenue for products is expected to stagnate or decline unless they have a competitive GPU offering. However, the US needs to have a domestic cutting edge chip manufacturing supply chain. It has expressed as much as a result of the 2022 supply chain shortage when we realized that letting TSMC manufacture 90% of the world's sub 5nm chips was a bad idea. That was the motivation behind passing the CHIPS act; Pat Gelsinger was instrumental in advising the current administration for this. The method for doing so has left a lot to be desired; Pat himself even expressed as much given the delay in fund disbursement, which in all fairness was only accelerated as a result of the election result and comments from republicans that they wanted to repeal the act. TSMC is not allowed to have the latest node fabricated in the US by law of the Taiwanese government. This is so that the country keeps its ""Silicon Shield"", the dependence globally to have manufacturing be done there which keeps Taiwan protected from China. But Intel has no such limitation. And TSMC is not able to fufill 100% of the orders for its customers; it is aggressively building more fabs to keep up with the ever increasing demand of AI. This demand exists for Intel to take part of. So, Intel in the next administration will have a tremendous amount of support for its Foundry, not Products, side of the business. This leaves Intel with a potential alternative to many of the scenarios analysts predict: It could solely dedicate to Foundry and sell off its Products division, most likely to AMD which shares the x86 architecture already and is solely focused on design. This would allow Intel to become a Foundry for external customers without having a conflict of interest, which I suspect is keeping them from customers. The CHIPS act stipulates that Intel has to retain a majority stake of Foundry but NOT Products, so this does not prevent Intel from dedicating itself to Foundry, which is what the US wants. I think Pat was waiting for the right climate to do this and it is coming soon. It is sad he did not stay long enough to see it happen. If Intel received the same amount of support from the US government that the Taiwanese government gave to TSMC, and was able to win external customers as a result of Tariffs, it could become the US TSMC. Much of this hinges on the 18A and later 14A nodes which are competitive with TSMC 2nm, which is the current cutting edge. But I think this is the desire of Intel and the next administration, and so they will work towards this goal. To diminish foundry would be a slow death for Intel. That is why I am still looking forward to Intel in 2025. If you got this far, thank you for reading. EDIT: Now that I think about it, it is also entirely possible for Qualcomm to buy Intel's Products division. I think they expressed as much earlier this year, but being they are primarily ARM I am not sure if it would be a good fit.",0.5359,NEGATIVE,0.9956

They think Amazon will overtake a 30 year CUDA industry software environment the entire world/industry has created THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AROUND). Go look up CUDA. It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four...

NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming Latest Sept 2025, with my guess, Jensen starts marketing from first half of 2025, and wider release commercially of NVDA CPU for 1st qtr of 2026, March, me thinks Jensen starts getting market ready all of 2025 for release in the wild September 2025 for retail user and full wider release by March 2026 / end of February 2026. Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?.. I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about.

Nearly every other chip designer abandoned fabs because businesses operate best when they focus on what they do best. Intel is unique in that it is set up to transform the business into a major foundry model going forward. That takes decades of investment which Intel is ahead on.

NVDA has been all the rage and justifiably so.csv,"Since NVDA reporter its Q1 2023 earnings, revealing huge demand for AI chips, the stock has surged to $3.3T. Revenues 4x, margins up expanded and everything seemed perfect. Bulls claimed the stock was getting cheaper to decelerating growth. Quarterly revenue growth has dropped from 88% to 34% to 18%, heading towards single digits. Next quarter we’ll see just 7%. All of the marginal buyers are in — sucking the last few retail buyers in with the lure of a split. History suggests short term bump after a split as we are seeing, but now institutional investors have a vast pool to distribute their shares in coming months. As the saying goes, “when the ducks are quacking, feed them.” If the quarterly revenue growth continues to moderate, earnings growth will be impacted as well — making the stock become more and more “expensive” (multiple screams higher) versus the theme of last year when the higher it climbed the “cheaper” it got. This does not change the fact that it is a great business with a great leader — which will play a role in the advance of AI technologies and productivity. It’s just going to be a heavy lift that it retains a perception of greater value than Amazon, Microsoft or the entire German Stock Market Capitalizations (where it trades now). NVDA is still a semiconductor company, which has never been a secular business — it’s cyclical. Always has been, always will be. As for 70% gross margins, as Bezos famously said, “your margin is my opportunity.” NVDA has not cured cancer. There will be more and more competition going forward. Intel’s Gaudi 3 is 50% faster than NVDA’s H100 and 40% more energy efficient. AMD is gunning for them.

And then we have a rich, a very aggressive cadence of Falcon Shores products following that. We also added the Gaudi 3 PC IE card to it, this use case of Xeon plus an accelerator or Gaudi accelerator is getting very good response from customers as well. So we'll be bringing that out later this year. But the real story is delivering the TCO value, delivering the enterprise use cases.

"NVDA will hit 5T market cap in 2026, and 10T market cap before 2032.csv","Hi regards, This is not a ""copium"" post about the recent stock price drops. I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest. The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY. First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"". Name Stock price EPS SP/EPS ratio AAPL 230 1,4 164 MSFT 413 2,95 140 AMD 145 0,16 1.035 META 516 5,16 100 AMZN 171 1,26 135 NVDA 116 0,68 170 As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price. But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list. AAPL Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits. How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new. But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more. MSFT They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are. They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy. They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office? AMD I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first. Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware. Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software. And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section. META They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value. ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS. AMZN The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL. NVDA AND OUR STAR CHILD. HOT TOPIC OF 2024. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company. Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?

Look at how long the dotcom bubble took, and more importantly, look how the late stage was characterized - explosion of IPOs. Until we get a flood of IPOs, we aren't in the late stage. Until we see an IPO for SexRobots Inc, we aren't in the late stage. At the moment we've got a handful of companies beating expectations because of AI revenue (good for Nvidia, long-term), and some beating CapEx expectations because of AI spending (good for Nvidia, short-term) The current situation Look at Nvidia P/E compared to its share price. We're halfway through the year. At the end of this fiscal year, Nvidia will be worth $180 at the midline of this trend. It is currently $113. That is a 57% return, 157% on an annualized basis. Nvidia is down 17% from its peak. Its hard to call the bottom, but yesterday we saw a major flash crash followed by a v back up. Much like the opposite of the ""blow-off"" tops that we see when the bull runs peak. Big volume selling, big volume buying. Big down, big up. I expect the fast bears used that to get out. The slow ones will watch their profits start eroding before also bailing and taking their gains. The slower ones will hit their stop losses, and the slowest will drift back into the red. If you're a bear in the green, take the W and get out Upcoming catalysts Other company earnings next week - MSFT, META, SNAP, AMD, ARM Upcoming earnings What are the market expectations for next earnings? They say they are expecting $0.59 per share. But last quarter Nvidia made that, on the back of 26B in revenue. For this quarter, Nvidia predicted 28B revenue. If they hit that, we're looking at $0.66. But of course they're being conservative. Why wouldn't they? When your growth is 262% you have plenty of room to estimate conservatively. How conservative are they usually? Last time they predicted 24B and hit 26B. If roughly that amount extra happens again, we're looking at 30B in revenue and $0.70 in profit.

NVIDIA (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang Points to 1 Trillion Opportunity for the Company.csv,"Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the next few weeks until the US election would be “confusing” for many since no one could say anything with conviction about who is going to be in the White House. Lee said that the market is going to trade “well” into the upcoming Fed meeting where he expects “some” rate cuts amid the labor market needing support and positive inflation data. Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said: However, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive. For this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that a trillion dollars’ worth of general-purpose data centers will inevitably transition to accelerated computing. “We’re in a computer revolution,” Huang said, pointing out that the first wave of data center modernization is driven by generative AI, which he described as more than just a tool—it’s a skill. Huang also emphasized the need for “densification,” with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) aiming to make data centers more efficient by compressing them into smaller spaces. He discussed NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it. Nvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia. Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave. At Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range. Of course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.

Nvidia The only problem you're gonna have is that you didn't sell more.csv,"Introduction Alright, so Nvidia is crazy overvalued right now. Just check out its P/E ratio – it's sitting at a whopping 73.94. And that's not all. Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.55, and the price-to-sales ratio is over 42. These numbers are way above what you typically see for tech stocks and the semiconductor industry. There are two big reasons why Nvidia's stock might take a hit: growing competition and lowered margins. Growing Competition First off, the competition is heating up big time. 🔥 AMD's MI300 series is a beast, merging CPU and GPU on the same chip, which is great for performance and energy efficiency. This is super important for data centers and AI applications, and it could seriously cut into Nvidia's market share. AMD is coming in hot, and Nvidia might end up feeling the burn. Then you've got Intel with their Gaudi3 GPU, which is packing some serious performance and efficiency for AI and machine learning tasks. More people might start switching to Intel's GPUs, giving Nvidia a run for its money. Intel's Gaudi3 could be the ghost in Nvidia's machine👻 Lowered Margins Then there's Amazon, which is throwing its hat into the ring with custom GPUs for their EC2 instances. These GPUs are optimized for machine learning and AI, and they integrate perfectly with Amazon's cloud services. This seamless integration could mean less reliance on Nvidia's products, pushing Nvidia to cut prices to stay competitive. Lower prices mean lower margins, which isn't great for Nvidia's bottom line. Amazon could very well turn Nvidia's margins into margin call memes. 📉 Adding to the heat, TSMC is thinking about jacking up production fees for Nvidia. The chairman's plans to raise prices could eat away at Nvidia's margins even more. If TSMC hikes those fees, Nvidia might have to dig deeper into their pockets, and that could be a real pain in the margins. 💸 Link (06/04) So yeah, Nvidia's stock might be flying high right now, but with all this competition and pressure on margins, it might not stay that way for long. It's looking like Nvidia might be headed from tendies to tears if they can't keep up. 😂 TL;DR Nvidia is trading high, but AMD, Intel, and Amazon are bringing the heat. 🔥 Competition + TSMC price hikes = potential margin squeeze. Stock might go from 🚀 to 💥 if they don't keep up. 😂",0.5456,NEGATIVE,0.9812
Nvidia's Blackwell Delay Offers Investors A Chance To 'Add To Positions' says Goldman Sachs.csv,"Nvidia Corp (NVDA) finds itself at the center of tech speculation as reports have surfaced about potential delays in its much-anticipated Blackwell architecture. With tech giants like Nvidia often facing the heat of public and market scrutiny, the slightest hiccup can stir investor unease. But is this delay really a cause for concern, or just a blip on Nvidia’s otherwise smooth journey towards AI supremacy? According to a report by The Information, Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell chips might hit a speed bump, delaying their release by over three months due to alleged design flaws. These chips were set to ship later this year, boasting promises of up to 30x better Inference performance over their predecessors. Despite this setback, Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs advises investors to remain calm and continue with their current strategies. The delay, while not ideal, is unlikely to impact Nvidia's 2025 earnings power or its market dominance, according to Hari. “We expect there to be little to no impact on CY2025 earnings and, most importantly, the company's long-term competitive position.” Hari believes that any short-term volatility in Nvidia's fundamentals will be just that—short-lived. The Market Reaction: Opportunity or Overreaction? For those ready to jump ship, Hari's advice is clear: stay the course. Nvidia's stock might experience some turbulence, but the company’s strong footing in the AI market isn't going anywhere. “We would consider any near-term dislocation in the stock as an opportunity to add to positions.” Despite a recent 15% correction, Nvidia remains a top pick, firmly seated on Goldman's Americas Conviction List with a 12-month price target of $135, suggesting a potential upside of nearly 26%. Even with Blackwell’s reported delays, Nvidia’s projected 39% year-over-year growth in 2025 remains unchanged. Hari’s bullish stance is rooted in Nvidia’s role as a crucial player in the rapidly evolving AI sector, especially as the demand for advanced AI infrastructure shows no signs of slowing down. Implications for Rival – AMD Interestingly, while the Blackwell delays might appear as a dark cloud over Nvidia, there could be a silver lining for competitors like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (AMD). “We believe the market could perceive this development as a marginal positive for AMD — the only alternative to Nvidia today in Data Center GPUs.” Although the analysts say AMD is unlikely to overtake Nvidia due to Nvidia’s strong market position and AMD’s challenges in scaling operations, this situation could still present a competitive boost for AMD. What’s Next for Nvidia? In the tech world, where speed and innovation reign supreme, a three-month delay might seem significant. However, Nvidia’s legacy of innovation and market leadership paints a different picture. As Hari points out, “any impact to CY2025 earnings will be negligible,” and the temporary setback should not deter investors from seeing Nvidia’s long-term value. For now, Nvidia’s strategy remains rock solid. The potential delay, whether factual or exaggerated, is but a temporary hurdle, according to Hari. As Nvidia navigates this challenge, the market watches closely, with many investors seeing a buying opportunity amid the noise. For those invested in Nvidia's future, Hari’s message is clear: hold steady, as the AI revolution waits for no one.",0.5505,NEGATIVE,0.9994
NVIDIA's share price surge and the outlook for the AI arithmetic market bubble risk and rational lay.csv,"As NVIDIA's share price has risen sharply in the short term, many have begun to wonder if the industry is facing a turning point or if there is a bubble. From the perspective of the industry giants, GPUs, as representatives of A1 arithmetic chips, are currently far from meeting demand. We can assume that AI applications are still only in their infancy, and there has not yet been a particularly prominent Al burst application in the world. Analyse the results: The AI market is still at an early stage: AI applications, despite explosive growth in recent years, are still at an early stage. The arithmetic power required for current AI applications (e.g., big language modelling, autonomous driving, robotics, etc.), especially GPUs, is still in the pre-burst stage. The growth of Tesla and the robotics industry, for example, predicts that billions of robots will be needed in the future for arithmetic support. This means that there is a huge potential for growth in AI arithmetic demand over the next few years, especially in inferential computing. GPUs as core hardware for AI: GPUs play a key role in AI inference computing, especially in tasks that require high parallel processing power (e.g., deep learning inference, autonomous driving, robot control, etc.). Although there are already many GPU products on the market, overall, the demand for AI computing power is still in a state of oversupply, and the size of the AI computing power market is likely to continue to expand, especially in the ‘reasoning’ segment of the demand for this segment is the area of high computation, especially in the field of automated driving, cloud computing and so on. Personal view: NVIDIA's leadership in the GPU space is well recognised, but many are beginning to worry about an industry bubble due to the short-term surge in its share price. NVIDIA's dominant position: Currently, NVIDIA is the almost unrivalled leader in the field of AI hardware (especially GPUs), and its products are widely used in AI training and reasoning calculations, especially playing a central role in large-scale data centres and cloud services. NVIDIA's rising share price reflects investors' optimistic expectations about the potential of the AI market. Bubble Risk: As NVIDIA's share price has surged, the market has become sceptical about whether it is overvalued. NVIDIA's high valuation could lead to the formation of a bubble, especially if its products and technologies are not sufficiently digested by the market. While the AI industry is promising, the market is volatile in the short term and the rise of competitors (e.g. AMD) could change the market landscape. Therefore, investors and industry observers need to be wary of market overheating and short-term speculation. Core view: US tech giants (e.g. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook) are supportive of NVIDIA's technology, but they will also support NVIDIA's competitors, such as AMD, in order to avoid the arithmetic market being monopolised by one company and to ensure the sustainable development of the industry. Analyse the results: Rational rather than short-term profit-driven: the behaviour of these tech giants suggests that they are not simply pursuing short-term profit when purchasing AI arithmetic, but are planning the security and sustainability of their own development in the long term. By supporting competitors such as AMD, these companies avoid the risk of the market becoming too dependent on NVIDIA alone, ensuring diversity in market competition and technological innovation. This kind of rational decision-making is crucial to the healthy development of the AI hardware market. If NVIDIA dominates the AI arithmetic market without competitive pressure, it could lead to overpricing, affecting the interests of other tech giants. As a result, companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon prefer to ensure diversity and healthy competition in the AI arithmetic market by supporting competitors such as AMD. In summary: future outlook and risks Huge potential for AI arithmetic: The demand for AI arithmetic is far from reaching its ceiling, especially in the area of inferential computing, and the market demand for GPUs will continue to grow as robotics and autonomous driving technologies evolve. The adoption of AI technologies will generate even more demand for arithmetic power in the coming decades, especially in emerging technologies such as robotics and autonomous driving. NVIDIA's dominance and risks: While NVIDIA's dominance in the AI hardware space cannot be ignored, the sharp rise in its share price and high market valuation have raised concerns about the existence of a bubble. Future technological competition, especially the rise of competitors such as AMD, may affect NVIDIA's market share. Long-term layout of industry giants: U.S. tech giants are very rational when investing in AI arithmetic, they will not simply pursue short-term benefits, but pay more attention to the diversity of the arithmetic market and the sustainability of the technology, to ensure that they can be invincible in the competition in the coming years. The AI arithmetic market is full of great potential, but is still in the early stages of development. While NVIDIA occupies a leading position in the AI hardware market, its high valuation and share price volatility also make the risk of a bubble",0.5575,POSITIVE,0.7135
NVIDIA’s next catalyst has to be sovereign AI.csv,"NVIDIA’s current valuation is not overtly expensive (FPER: 33, PEG: 1.61 according to FINVIZ) and the GPU orders for next year are all booked. Yet the stock is meeting strong resistance around $130. I think this is partially because a lot of people have been burned by CISCO during dot-com bubble and do not want to price in the future too much. But the real concern is that their revenue is almost entirely dependent on the rest of M7 and they are charging the big tech 80 % margin. The big tech, while being hammered by Wall Street for the increased CAPEX spending, indicated during last earning that they will not reduce their investment on AI. However, they did mention that they are/plan using their NPU (Google TPU, Tesla Dojo, AMD) to reduce the usage of NVIDIA GPU. Furthermore, GPT5 and Apple Intelligence should be available to the public by the end of this year. If these do not impress, the entire AI sector may see significant slowdown. But if GPT5 shows plateauing of performance while people find Apple Intelligence interesting, paradigm could shift toward smaller models and inference efficiency, again reducing the demand for NVIDIA. To justify significant increase in NVIDIA’s stock price, they need to show that they are not entirely dependent on the Big Tech. The only other potential buyers that have as much buying power are governments. Also, if the economy is going through downturns, governments have excuse to increase their spending. What I am paying attention to during the earning call is demonstration from NVIDIA that they are receiving significant demand from non-Big Tech such as governments.",0.5529,NEGATIVE,0.9994

Short Call Strategy Am I Regarded or Might This Actually Work.csv,"Okay, so I'm guessing a good amount of us in this subreddit were new to options trading at some point in time, and when we were just itty bitty option noobs first hearing about them, we just thought: "" Wow! this is just the same thing as betting on stocks but with leverage right?"" (might just be me when I first got into options trading but whatever). Moving on. I assume that many people's first instinct was to go and buy a call on a stock they were very bullish on. And I would assume that once we did that, we lost the entire position because we never knew how theta decay, IV, DTE, strike price, and other factors could sink your entire position. The thing about these factors is that when you buy a call, the majority of these factors are stacked against you, and if you don't want them to be completely stacked against you, you gotta pay up for a higher premium which is gonna yield the same or less of a return then the lower priced (but considerably more risky) options. You're paying for less risk. Long Calls are usually only profitable when the underlying has a significant enough uptick to outweigh all the other factors dragging down the value of the option. I'm sorry I don't mean to repeat the basics of valuing options but I think it's important to pretext them a little bit so my strategy makes more sense in the grand scheme of things. Okay, so my strategy is as follows: why buy a call, and have all of these factors stacked against you, when you can sell one, and have them work in your favor; I guess the whole basis is: the shittier the call, the better (meaning how likely it is to expire or be exercised with no value). The even better thing is we can magnify the shittiness to work in our favor on the sell side by selling balls deep out of the money calls, with low IV, and few DTE. And we can magnify this even further by selling calls on options with really shitty stocks underlying; stocks that are down 40% YTD, or just really, really stagnant not moving anywhere (might also get some sexy low IV to work in your favor there too). I don't really have any stocks in mind right now to lock this trade in off the top of my head, but $NOC and $AMD are quite down this last month and a half, and are relatively popular stocks. Like I said I need to find some better stocks for this Strat; these are not the ones I wanna go with, just what I thought of off the top of my head Now you might be saying two things: 1. ""The prices on them are probably gonna be pennies on the dollar. Sure the odds might be in your favor, but the yield is gonna be very low"", and 2. ""What fucking moron is gonna be stupid enough to buy these calls?"". To answer question 1: Why not just sell more calls? And to answer question 2: I don't think I need to illustrate the stupidity of individuals in the market, but if you need me to, here you go: WSB regards (not dissing, I am also a WSB regard who has lost thousands on YOLOs), teenagers with a Robinhood account that just found out about options, and maybe even people who are legit investors, but have bought the call as a part of some bigger options play, like a straddle, or iron condor (not to mention that in the example of the straddle, I don't think they would really give a shit if the call tanked because, well, it's a straddle lol, the put on the other side would cover the losses and make profit{and yeah there are probably more plays where this is the case that I am just forgetting about, but this is the example I'm just gonna go with for now}). Not to mention markets are huge and I've checked the open interest on some of these calls and there are hundreds going up to the thousands in open interest on balls deep OTM, 2DTE, Low IV call options. Anyways, I guess the reason I made this post is to double check with some options veteran (I've been into options for a little less than a year, but I have some knowledge on them from my job) to see if this strategy is complete delusional manic retardation, or if there is actually some substance to it. I wanna make sure there isn't some variable or factor I'm not accounting for that could tank this entire play.

This means that the stock has a lot of room for growth and i firmly believe that it can reach a market cap of $75 billion after its next ER, which would make the share price at around $1300. I am currently holding 10 shares right now, which is down from my 20 shares from yesterday as i had sold at $880.

SMCI loose analysis and opportunity simmering.csv,"SMCI golden age and beautiful chart. After hours Friday SMCI jumped almost 9 percent! Makes perfect sense that investors are flooding back into this stock! It has been so beaten down over the last six months by bad press and fears of fraud. Those fears have been quelled by a new CFO and auditing team. We just saw in the last month of 72% rally and there is still plenty of room to run on Monday it will open up around $48, the last critical level we saw was $49. Also, it looks like a somewhat sloppy cup and handle pattern is forming. My half baked technical analysis is. We will see a minor pull back around $50 to finish the pattern, then it will launch back up to the next critical level around $60 a share. Fundamentally speaking, they have been showing plenty of growth and demand for their products which mainly consists of hardware to House semiconductors, especially their trademark marked water cooled rack, which directly addresses a huge issue that centers are facing as computing power gets to Skynet levels. Their price to earnings ratio is a modest 21.9, the earnings per share is a humble 2, the ps ratio is 1.5 which is the lowest among its competitors. In fact all of its metrics or lowest amongst its competitors except for the EPS for AMD, which is 1.1. There will be much to see within the next quarterly earnings report and how they managed to address their auditing issues and reporting issues. But I think this company still has room to run and definitely has legs. I have 200 shares with plans to buy much more. I was going to buy on the next red day, expecting it to be Monday, but I digress. Next pull back I’m buying calls with a strike price of about $49-$55 exp in March. Even considering a YOLO.

"SMCI will skyrocket soon, DONT MISS OUT!.csv","So currently SMCI is around the $840 to $850 levels but hit $775 on monday. This meant that there is still a chance to buy SMCI while the shares are cheap right before they release their earnings in a month. The reason why im bullish on SMCI is because AI is driving the stock to skyrocket as they work alongside Nvidia and AMD in providing data centres. Elon musk had also catapulted the stock to reach over $1000 as he had tweeted that he is partnering with Dell and SMCI to provide AI data centres for its generative AI chatbot. https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/super-micro-computer-ceo-post-picuture-with-elon-musk-at-ai-data-center-432SI-3505317 As a result of this, SMCI will most likely smash their earnings report of $8.10 per share in early august and hopefully make the stock reach above $1100, which is a 30% increase from what the share price is today.

Due to their partnerships, and the increasing demand for AI server systems, SMCI had their EPS increase significantly as their EPS forecast is around $8.00 per share, which is a major increase from last year, which was $3.51 per share. They also have a PE ratio that is lower than Nvidia and AMD at around 45, a foward PE of 21.79 and a PEG ratio of under 1. As a result of their PEG ratio being below 1, it means that the company is considered as undervalued, and a good investment to have. The stock is down 40% from ATH and i personally believe that it could reach over $1000 by their next earnings release which is in the end of july.

Strong AI and Semiconductor weeks ahead.csv,"Hi all, I think that AI and esp. Semiconductor Stocks have a couple of strong weeks ahead. Starting on Tuesday, October 15th 2024, the Open Compute Project (OCP) global summit takes place in San Jose, California. Between 9 AM and 11:30 AM there'll be short keynotes (each 12 mins) presented by Meta, NVidia, AI Clusters, Intel, AMD, Microsoft and Google (full schedule here). Now, I don't think that there'll be any big surprises. But the Summit still presents an opportunity for public remarks about how strong the demand is or what so ever. Also, there's an article that says that Broadcom (AVGO) is going to show case cutting-edge AI infrastructure. Further it is expected that Taiwan Semiconductor Company (TSM) and ASML Holding (ASML) will publish their Q3 earnings next week. TSM will present its earnings on October 17th 2024 at 14:00 Taiwan time / 02:00 Eastern Time. So pre-market movements will most likely be wild on Thursday as a large part of the industry relies on TSM. If TSM reports a great Q3 revenue, this could push Nvidia over the current all time high. Also according to Moore's law is dead, the first RTX 5000 series GPUs are ready to be sold, but are not released because of business reasons (here at 22:22). So they could still change their mind and ship in Q4. Next, it is rumored (by moore's law is dead) that AMD will release a new CPU by the end of October or early November, the 9800X3D which is an 8 Core Gaming CPU with 3D cache and it is expected that it will be the fastest gaming CPU releasing this year. Although Client is not as important for AMD, it will still be beneficial to have this CPU released before the holiday season. Especially since Zen5 Rysen has so far been viewed as rather disappointing. Moore's law is dead also mentions an RX 7650 GRE GPU, which could launch alongside Ryzen 9800X3D. Releasing a slightly refreshed and cheap RDNA3 GPU could be a good move by AMD to get rid of RDNA3 stock ahead of the RDNA4 launch in 2025. Since the Ryzen 9800X3D has not yet been anounced, I don't think that it has been priced in and could give the stock a slight boost to recover from the -4% last Thursday. Also, I although Investors were not excited about AMDs Advancing AI event, I think AMDs position in the market is still solid. According to the slides shown at the event, AMD Epic has increased its market share to 34%. And according to tests AMD Epyc Turin obliterates Xeon 6 Granite Rapids, while being cheaper. Because of this, I think AMD is in a good position to gain more server market share. Further, the news about Nvidia Blackwell being sold out for the next 12 Months is not only good news for Nvidia but also for AMD. Sure, everyone wants blackwell. but if one can't get blackwell and if AMD Instinct MI325X is faster than Nvidia Hopper (H200), then they might be able to win over customers from nvidia, who would like to buy blackwell but can't in due time. Also, AMDs earnings should be reported on October 29 2024. Due to Ryzen Zen5 being disappointing and there being apparently a large RDNA3 stock remaining. If AMDs Instinct systems are selling well, this would also be good news for Micron Industries (MU), which produces high bandwith memory (HBM3e). And then there's Intel. Their newest releases seem to have been disappointing. But they claim to be making progress with their foundries.

To start off, we'll go big in the cap spectrum. Our millenial buys AAPL products, uses MSFT Excel and Outlook at their ""Information Worker"" job. They are frequently gamers, so they need to buy NVDA GPUs and AMD CPUs. They often buy these at AMZN. They buy YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, so they can skip the ads of their fellow influencers (GOOGL) They spent most of their waking hours at META's Instagram website. They drive a TSLA or RIVN. They're on the GLP-1 drug (LLY) to impress their SOs. They're churning their credit cards with AXP Platinum and Gold, JPM's Chase Sapphire Preffered (no, NOT Reserve), some younger ones need to rely on COF's Venture and Venture X cards that gave nice ""subs"". They use these cards frequently to eat out and earn those points at CMG, SHAK and SG. They're flying a lot on DAL, and they need their free wifi that is often sponsored by their preferred choice of mobile carrier, TMUS. To get to the airport they need to use UBER or LYFT, since they don't want to drive their sweet electric ride. When they arrive at their destination airport, they pick up their rental car, and of course they prefer AVIS (CAR), but their credit cards give them presential circle status on HTZ, so they are ok with that too. They check into their hotel room at Marriott (MAR) to impress their friends, but really they are using all their Chase points to book Hyatt (H) hotels. The slightly less premium young ones will have to go Hilton (HLT) and fly on UAL. They often booked all this travel on EXPE or BKNG. Sometimes they use ABNB. When they check in they need to get some food, so they use their DASH gift card they bought at COST every two weeks because they get 20% off. When they go to Vegas, they prefer to stay in WYNN, because it's where all the hot ones stay. After they're done with their holidaying which they do basically 4 months out of the year, they're going to ULTA or LULU to buy their beauty products or Khakis. They are drop shipping on SHOP and sometimes they need to use ZM to conduct ""business"" for their ""coaching classes"" that they teach. A lot of times they get paid using Venmo (PYPL).

"The next tech giant Why HOOD, PLTR and DKNG are the investment opportunities of a lifetime (Part 1).csv","I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong. $AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice. $NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were. And so in true wsb fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB. There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long. From a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about. And so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry : If you are under 40 years old, $HOOD (Finance), $PLTR (Defense) and $DKNG (gambling) will 100x during your investment horizon.

The short report for Intel (INTC) - A rabbit hole of CPU failures rate since 2022.csv,"Forenote: Im a technical person, A developer, this will be a technical DD to show how intel is failing to do their basic business model of manufacturing CPUs. Over the past month or so Intels customers have been becoming increasing irrate about CPUs just flat out dying after various finger pointing from Intel being debunked. I first caught wind of intels failures when a friends system started to become unstable, he would crash in games and sometimes doing mundane tasks. It all came to a clicking point when his systems files started becoming corrupted and he needed to attempt reinstalling windows. The attempts failed, windows couldnt even install without corrupted files, sometimes it would install and look fine, but running a verification shows that various system files were still corrupted but not important enough for the system to boot successfully. He would still get various crashes doing mundane things and gaming. It was basically a working brick at this point. So i got my research hat on, and discovered various reddit users on r/pcmasterrace were also reporting instability with their PCs. Not alot tho, this has been the wierd thing, Intel has such a large CPU failure rate, but not alot of reports which caught everyone by suprise. It started to make sense, the causes of the crashes were different for everything. Users were reporting issues with Nvidia, Issues with RAM, and issues with corrupted data. Obviously to any layman, these issues dont instantly point to an issue with the CPU. With GPU errors, Nvidia initially got heat, but Nvidia quickly debunked the issue reporting the GPUs that were returned were fully functional and had no issues. So I pulled out my handy dandy debug tools since my friend managed to get windows installed and it kinda runs. The first tests I ran were memory block verification. This validates that the memory is able to hold data immutably, after 4 hours the tests finished all green, the memory was stable and wasnt corrupting data. (its worth noting that the memory test software I used was very CPU lite so the CPU has little chance to corrupt the data its self, this is a stark difference to the Drive tests I ran.). Since my friend was getting corrupted files almost everytime he install anything, I ran the disk debug tools, these pull the S.M.A.R.T data from the drive and run various read and write tests. The S.M.A.R.T data came back green, the drive was reporting it had no errors or irregularies and was functioning fine, So i moved to the read and write tests, all red, the drive had a 90% file currption rate, I pulled the S.M.A.R.T data again, All green, the drive was still reporting it was functioning correctly. At this point, anyone would deduce they had a bad drive that was misbehaving, leading to the decreased number of CPU failure reports. After all, How can you say the CPU is bad when you have corrupt files? Many people forget how much the CPU is responsable for. When you read files or write files, its the CPU that tells the Drive what to store and where and what to read and where it is on the disk to read it from. and as i said, the software I used to test the drives is CPU intensive, it uses the the CPU to generate random data to store on the drive and hashes that data to verify it. So a bad CPU = Currupted data on the drive. Luckly my friend has 4 drives, So I told him to take out the ""bad"" drive and put in another one, I ran all my tests again and same result, the drive was reporting it was functional, but all the data was corrupted. The result was the same with all the drives tested. Now, this is a luxary many people dont have. Many people would get corrupted data on their drive and think the drive is dying and get a new one. However with 4 tests samples all failing the same way when days ago they were all fine is a very low chance. Now for the kicker, Intel has a tool to verify that the Intel CPU you have is a genuine Intel CPU, I guess intel has a problem of china making fake intel CPUs??? Ive never seen any but what the hell, its a useful tools since its does some basic CPU level checks. So i ran the verifier tool and its first test for a genuine CPU comes back green, Cool, it is a real Intel CPU. Memory test comes back green (We alreadt tested this soo good), next was the Graphics tests. Failed, the CPU was attempting to send data to the GPU and it corrupted the GPU memory. So now we have 2 symptoms. Disk data corruption GPU memory corruption My friend has Nvidia GPU and Nvidia previously debunked any issues with their GPUs. But we have a common cause, Intel CPUs are corrupting data when sending it to another device in the system (except RAM), Data sent to a disk gets corrupted and data sent to the GPU gets corrupted, which would explain the game crashes. Various other tests passed from boost speed changing, Wifi tests and math operations. After I finished all the tests and determed the issue is with the CPU, my friend RMA'd the CPU. This is where more troubles start. Intel refused the RMA, citing user damage, According to intel all the issues my friend was having was his fault and he caused the damage, After it was refused, I filed the RMA for him, to the same response, but because im a stickler I pushed for more info, Intel was refusing the RMA because of overclocking done by the motherboard. This is a previous blame game intel played, they were blaming Motherboards for putting in stock overclocks on CPUs causing them to fail, but this wasnt the case with my friend, his motherboard wasnt even stock overclocked, but intel refused it anyway. After this point is when the waterfall started coming down, a advanced tech-youtuber posted an exposé about intels CPU failures. See: Intel has a HUGE problem - Level1Tech the curtains were starting to fall, Apparently Game developers and datacenters (Intels BIGGEST customers) were getting large amounts of CPU failures specificly with intel CPUs. Now datacenters are normally quiet about this type of thing, opting to sort their issues directly with intel, but intel is turning away datacenters RMA's of thousands of CPUs, these datacenters has since publicly reported they are dropping intel systems from their products and only supporting AMD systems from now on. Intel has lost their largest customer base, because of their defective products and refusing to take responsability for the product inherit flaw. Intel is hoping this goes unnoticed, since reports are still low of CPUs failing because the errors are random and different each time and users dont know their CPU is defective, there isnt a big in your face ""The Intel CPU in this system has errored"" its always an error with something else, which is caused by the CPU. So intel is betting on customers blaming other manufactures like they did with Nvidia when this all started. Timeline of events: [Dec 2022] The first instances of ""Out of Video Memory"" issues on 13th Gen Core i9 CPUs were reported back in 2022. (Source: Reddit). This is a few months after the release of Intel's 13th Gen CPUs & RTX 40 GPUs. [Throughout 2023] Several users have started reporting game crashes and issues in high-profile AAA titles such as Callisto Protocol and Hogwarts Legacy (among many others). Both tiles are based on Unreal Engine (released in 2023) and feature a shader compilation process at the start. There are currently thousands of such issues reported on Steam Community Forums and Reddit. [February 2024] A post by Sebastian Castellanos brings the issue to the limelight, highlighting the ""worrying trend"" of stability issues affecting 14th and 13th-gen CPUs. [February 2024] Our editor along with various other tech outlets start reporting the issue and bringing the matter on to the mainstream media. Quickly, it is pointed out that underclocking and undervolting the chips can result in better stability. [April 2024] NVIDIA Issued a formal statement that the stability issues are not related to its GPUs but rather Intel CPUs. [April 2024] Intel announces its investigation of the reports of instability issues affecting 13th and 14th Gen CPUs. [April 2024] Oodle Publishes about their discovery about users Intel systems experiencing data corruption. [April 2024] Motherboard makers quickly roll out ""Baseline"" power profiles in new BIOS, which lower power limits on high-end 14th & 13th Gen CPUs but also lead to significant performance drops. [May 2024] Intel releases a statement, recommending motherboard makers to ship ""Intel Default Settings"" in BIOS by default rather than customized settings. [June 2024] Intel discovers a bug within its eTVB microcode while investigating the root cause of 14th and 13th Gen Instability issues. This doesn't fix the instability problems. Board makers quickly roll out BIOS with a new microcode fix. [June 2024] Alderon Games publishes about there players, developers and servers Intel CPUs failing over a period of months and switch to only AMD systems. [July 2024] Intel denies an RMA to HardwareTimes editor who already RMA'd at least two CPUs which produced instability issues. [July 2024] Wendell from Level1Techs & Steve Burke from GamersNexus are the first big tech media outlets on YouTube to further highlight the instability issues, diving into additional details such as OEM frustration with the matter and a possible recall. [July 2024] GamersNexus highlights a potential ""oxidation"" defect being a problem with a certain batch of Intel 14th & 13th Gen CPUs that might lead to instability problems. [July 2024] Intel says the 14th & 13th Gen Mobile CPUs are not affected by the same instability issues as the desktop CPUs. [July 2024] GamersNexus reports they will not be recommending Intel CPUs regardless of the outcome for upcoming AMD 9000 series reviews [July 2024] Intel issues a statement confirming that they have found the root cause of the instability issues which happen to be elevated operating voltages and will be issuing a new microcode fix to its partners by mid of August [July 2024] Users are reporting instability issues with Intel 14th gen Laptop CPUs.

Edit: Ive received internal leaks from Intel employees explaining internal issues and intels failures. Source 1: The leading theory inside Intel right now, and it is just a theory, is that the Ring Bus is getting cooked because it's fed by the same rail as the P-Cores and E-Cores. Raptor Lake required incredibly high voltages that the clocks required to be competitive with Zen 4, and it seems like it was just pushed too hard. This is an inherent flaw that would be in Bartlett too it's overvolted. Meteor Lake isn't affected, and Emerald Rapids is unlikely be effected materially. Source 2: I never worked directly on Raptor Lake [Intel Design Engineer], but I did have exposure to Alder Lake, and I can confirm that they were very concerned about the ring bus getting damaged if the voltage was pushed too high. I can also confirm that Raptor Lake was rushed through the design and validation process... Source 3: I [Intel Foundry Services] can tell you that Raptor Lake was rushed through our Fab in Arizona in record time, but it's also produced in other fabs. However, this location (Arizona) is notable because I can confirm that there was an Oxidation issue caused by some failure in our HVAC system between March & June of 2023. It was so bad that Keyvan Esfarjani had to fly in to make decision about which wafers (which cost as much as a Model X each) needed to be thrown away. To be clear, I don't know what decision was made, but I do know that this event DID happen. And by the way, it affected Sapphire Rapids yields as well...although I doubt it's an issue that wasn't",0.5221,NEGATIVE,0.9929

Yes while the main points of the short report were not mentioned and intel continues to hide this infomation from Investors, they cant ignore the impact it has on their bottom line. RMA's are not cheap and the amount of money and time they are spending to fix the issue for existing chips while trying their hardest to deny RMAs for failed CPUs. Customers have lost faith in Intel, their chips are constantly beaten by AMD offerings and having a high failure rate really was the last nail in the coffin. Enterprise customers are switching, gamers are switching, datacetners are switching. All switching to AMD (or Arm - Yes Arm is starting to see some enterprise deployments, very little tho.) Intel will continue to have bad earnings for the forseable future (as they guided), And they also havnt announced (and likly wont) the delay of their next gen CPUs (15000 series) for desktop, they are expected to announce only Mobile chips and act like Desktop and server CPUs dont exist this generation.

VSH - The Forgotten King of Chips.csv,"TLDR: $VSH (Vishay Intertechnology) is printing money while everyone sleeps on it. $VSH just got the stamp of approval from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, confirming it as a hidden winner in Nvidia’s AI and RTX 50 supply chain. With key wins in MOSFETs, capacitors, and resistors, $VSH is now primed for explosive growth, riding Nvidia’s dominance in AI servers and GPUs. If you’re not jacked up on $VSH, you’re not meant to have money. Who is $VSH? Vishay Intertechnology is a veteran in the electronics industry. They make essential components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and semiconductors. You know, the boring stuff that makes your GPU, PS5, and electric toothbrush actually work. They’ve been doing this since 1962. That’s right, this company has survived every market downturn, bubble, and chip shortage in the last 60+ years. Meanwhile, you can’t even survive a red day on SPY. Why $VSH is printing money: Chips are everywhere—cars, phones, smart homes, AI servers. The global semiconductor market is growing at an insane pace (projected $1 trillion market by 2030). Guess what? Vishay is supplying the guts. Look at their P/E ratio: 12.5 (as of last check). Compare that to Nvidia’s 75+ or AMD’s 30-ish. $VSH is practically trading at the bargain bin, and yet their revenues are consistently strong. Vishay’s last earnings report crushed expectations, with double-digit growth in several segments. They’re sitting on $3.4B in annual revenue with plans to scale. Oh, and they’re buying back shares like they’re on clearance at Costco. Everyone’s hyped about Nvidia because of AI. Guess what? Vishay supplies components used in AI hardware, EV charging stations, and industrial automation. While Nvidia makes the sexy GPUs, Vishay sells the boring but essential resistors and capacitors that keep those GPUs from melting your motherboard. They’re eating up the market share. Recent Catalysts: Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo dropped a bombshell: Vishay is a key supplier for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI servers (GB200 series, DGX/HGX B200) and the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. These are Nvidia’s future bread-and-butter products, dominating AI and high-end gaming. Vishay replaced Infineon as Nvidia’s MOSFET supplier. Yes, Infineon, the semiconductor giant, just got sidelined. This Is MASSIVE for $VSH. Vishay is providing MOSFET/DrMOS (VRPower), vPolyTan (Polymer Tantalum Capacitors), and Current Shunt Resistors. These components are critical for Nvidia’s most cutting-edge products: • GB200 series AI servers: Nvidia’s next-gen AI infrastructure. • RTX 50 series GPUs: The next flagship graphics cards. Vishay’s vPolyTan capacitors (especially the T55 series) are already facing a supply crunch for 2025. That’s how in-demand they are. Kuo estimates that Vishay’s MOSFET production alone will contribute 20%-30% of revenue by 2025—with above-average gross profit margins. The vPolyTan capacitors will add a high single-digit percentage of revenue with significantly above-average margins. Translation? Vishay is printing money. Vishay’s production lines are already at capacity through 2025. When your biggest challenge is meeting demand, you’re in a good spot. Beyond Nvidia, Vishay is also poised to benefit from: • Automotive rebound: As EV production scales, Vishay’s components are critical. • IoT growth: Billions of devices mean billions of tiny components. Vishay is at the center of it. The Stock Is Still Cheap Even after today’s 7% jump to $18.35, $VSH is wildly undervalued. As I said earlier, the P/E ratio is still around 12-13, compared to Nvidia’s 75+. This is a company with real earnings, real dividends, and real growth potential. This is a great opportunity to make back everything you lost from your MSTR calls. Positions: Shares, 01/17/25 20C",0.5352,POSITIVE,0.9824

"Weekly jobless claims fall to 233,000, less than expected, in a positive sign for labor market.csv","Last night, the U.S. announced that the number of initial unemployment claims for last week was 233,000, significantly lower than the previous week's 249,000 and also below the market's expectation of 240,000! A few days ago, Mr. Wang mentioned that for the U.S. stock market to stop declining, the economic and labor data released must continue to be strong in order to ease concerns about a potential economic recession. Yesterday's sharp drop in initial unemployment claims marked the largest decrease in a year, indicating that the number of people recently unemployed has decreased. This alleviated the recession concerns raised by last Friday's non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate data, spurring a rally in U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 index surging over 2.3%, the largest single-day gain in 21 months 📈. On the other hand, the demand for the 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds at the auctions over the past two days was poor, causing the 10-year yield to exceed 4% once again! Tech giants saw a broad rebound, with Meta rising 4.2%, Alphabet up 1.9%, Amazon gaining 1.8%, Apple increasing 1.6%, and Microsoft rebounding 1%. Nvidia surged over 6%, returning to the $100 mark, leading to a rebound in semiconductor stocks. Broadcom, Micron, and Applied Materials all jumped more than 6%, while Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and AMD all saw gains of over 5%! Taiwan's ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) also rebounded, with TSMC and UMC both jumping more than 6%, and ASE gaining over 4%. However, it's still important to note that the number of continuing unemployment claims is rising, reaching its highest level since November 2021, nearly three years ago! Therefore, Wall Street's foreign investors remain concerned about the economy. For example, JPMorgan still believes the U.S. economy will enter a recession, raising the probability from 25% to 35%!

Why I am going long on Intel and letting Bad Daddy Gelsinger take me to Uranus - DD TurboNerd Post.csv,"TLDR: This stock fucking sucks, and I love it. But the developing foundry business is gonna get absolutely bananas under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for the sole purpose of developing it. They are not gonna let the other chip companies continue to take nut shots on them and they are just gonna make everyone chips for them. Anyways I all in on Mar 2025 Calls (which are like $4.50 - $5.00) right now. Here is some DD. Dog of the Dow Intel has lagged behind other chip titans such as [[AMD - AMD]] and [[NVDA -NVIDIA]] as they race to design and build chips to handle [[AI]] workloads. Both AMD and NVIDA have seen tremendous growth over the past 18 months (as of June 2024). A growth pattern that has gone completely unanswered by INTEL up until this point. Looking at the [[Price to Earnings Ratio]] of both AMD and NVIDIA it is easy to see how disconnected from earnings they have become (though they are both incredibly profitable). AMD P/E Ratio: 67.30 NVIDIA P/E Ratio: 238.53 INTEL P/E Ratio 31.79 AMD is wildly inflated relative to its competition in the space. NVDA is has a more ""sane"" price to earnings but it has also been nearly printing its own money with the amount of sales it has been making. The price of NVIDIA still ""feels"" high despite it's recent split. Another interesting metric to take a look at is the [[Price/Tangible Book]] - Where you take the current price of the stock and compare it to the tangle value of all its assets minus good will. AMD P/TB Ratio: 23.61 NVIDIA P/TB Ratio: 64.73 INTEL P/TB Ratio: 1.75 This says a few things; One either Intel has barely any assets worth liquidating relative to its stock price and the market has priced the stock appropriately, OR the price of the stock is selling for a very reasonable price related to the actual value of the company. This could be considered paying only .75 above book value of the company as a ""premium"" for future expected value. Source: Any trading platform that has data you ding dongs - go look it up. I got these from Schwab jfc. Technical Except for this past Wednesday, this company has been hard stuck around $30 after a selloff from its 52 week high of $51.28. 31.50 appears to be the most reliable resistance level we can work off of right now, then $32.50 after that. If it breaks both of those on a run up, there is literally no ceiling until $46. SO, you tell me what that means. The further you zoom out on your shitty little trading app the more you will see that this period we are in is nothing but consolidation. Foundry Intel's new foundry business will be the corner stone of its future growth. Forget the in house made chips. The company is not-so-silently tyring to be the American version of TSMC. Here is an article they posted on their own site outlining their model. https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-outlines-new-financial-reporting-structure.html#gs.a8z07s Note this section: April 9th 2024 ""Intel Foundry is a newly established operating segment that includes foundry technology development, foundry manufacturing and supply chain, and foundry services (formerly IFS). Under this new structure, Intel Foundry will recognize revenues generated from both external foundry customers and Intel Products..."" Fuck me, if they pull this off under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for this specific function, this stock could easily moon. Not to mention this article detailing that NVIDIA will start using Intels Foundry to start making its own chips. https://www.techspot.com/news/101725-nvidia-turning-intel-foundry-services-expand-gpu-ai.html#:~:text=Nvidia%20could%20also%20choose%20to,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202024. Chips Act ""U.S. Department of Commerce has proposed up to $8.5 billion in direct funding through the CHIPS and Science Act to advance Intel’s commercial semiconductor projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon. Intel also expects to benefit from a U.S. Treasury Department Investment Tax Credit (ITC) of up to 25% on more than $100 billion in qualified investments and eligibility for federal loans up to $11 billion. Proposed funding supports Intel’s previously announced plans to invest more than $100 billion in the U.S. over five years to expand U.S. chipmaking capacity and capabilities critical to economic and national security and acceleration of emerging technologies, such as AI. Intel’s investments are expected to create more than 10,000 company jobs and nearly 20,000 construction jobs, and to support more than 50,000 indirect jobs with suppliers and supporting industries. "" https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/us-chips-act-intel-direct-funding.html#gs.a8z5ze So yea Intel is gonna get paid, and quite a bit. The article states that they are slated to receive up to $8.5 billion, with a B. X86 chips - Speculation With Arm taking dominance over portable computers like laptops, tablets and phones, X86 looks pretty boring. Except you have to remember that both AMD and Intel are still cranking these bad boys out like nobody's business. The raw horsepower in these for desktop workstations and servers is still not matched by ARM and probably wont be for quite a while. Sure they are not quite as power efficient, but who cares in a data center or major compute space anyways. Intel owns almost all of the IP for X86 processors too. AMD has a little bit and they have made improvements and designs of their own that they have been able to patent, but INTEL is the OG maker of these chips. Arm will probably continue to dominate the landscape, but they are the people who license their chips are going to need them made somewhere. They will have like two options. Intel or TSMC. China What happens when CHYNA pulls the trigger and takes over Taiwan. Where is everyone gonna have their chips made? Arizona, that's where. TSMC and Intel are both setting up MASSIVE Fabs there. So, when all the other chip companies get absolutely smoked I expect to see a giant green candle on that morning for INTC. I will probably write more later but this shit got way long way fast.

Why I bought Puts on MNST (Monster).csv,"Since Monster releases its earnings report after market, it’s time for some puts… or calls if you are based and want to inverse me Reason 1: High expectations - Current expectations for this quarterly are quite high.. Expected earnings per share are $0.452 as opposed to the $0.400 of a year ago . In this same light the market expects (has already priced in) a nearly 200 million dollar increase in revenue from the year prior.. Put quite simply these massive increases are already expected and priced in, and it’s much easier to fall short when expectations are this high Reason 2: Competition - PepsiCo is fighting hard for market share of the energy drink market and threw $550 million dollars for an 8.5% share of Celsius in 2022. Monster has already struggled to maintain market share versus Red Bull, which owns the largest portion of the energy drink market.. Now on top of this already stiff competition they have to deal with a whale like PepsiCo flooding the market with products like Rockstar and Celsius over time Reason 3: regulation- As more health focused initiatives take place in Europe and America, products like monster will face increased scrutiny, both from consumers and governments alike (regulations on certain contents). Reason 4: Even those who hit their goals have been getting smashed… AMD and Reddit- Now I get what you are thinking “what the heck do these companies have to do with monster”… and yea they have no direct relationship.. But even after surpassing their goals for this last quarter these companies have seen their value get smashed.. The market is being mad weird and bearish right now when it comes to earnings. So in essence this combined with reason 1 (the high goals they already have), means that I feel that the odds favor the Put/bear side Hope you enjoyed my presentation!!

"Why I think Intel is a Misunderstood, Undervalued Play – A Bet on 18A (+EV DD).csv","Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.",0.5307,NEGATIVE,0.9997
Why Intel is the most undervalued tech stock right now.csv,"Intel ($INTC) is an insane bargain right now, as it is trading at year 1999 stock price.

Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3). Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD & NVIDIA offerings. But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment. Currently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons. Microsoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in.

My dad worked in equities, so when he lost his ability to communicate effectively with me (and since I had significantly more income because I'm not paying rent) - I truthfully went ballistic on investing. Pretty much said fuck it, I'm living at home I don't need a 6 month emergency fund till I move out and went all-in. Granted 40% of my portfolio not listed here is in a 401k account entirely in the S&P 500 (set & forget just in case my equities went to hell as with the rest of my life lol). I believe in the margin of safety when investing. I like to invest in high-quality companies that generate lots of cash as the backbone of my portfolio. Since 2021 (before my dad got this cancer shit), I spoke with him and he basically said just look at the fundamentals of a company and invest in growth companies that you think will be around in 5-10 years. I look for value within growth stocks (i know paradoxical). Some of my icons in investing are David Tepper & Michael Burry. Again below is all my own experience and reflects only my own views and are not a recommendation of my company (corporate. disclaimer). My portfolio is heavily weighted (85%) between several stocks: AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL (So fucking cheap r u kidding me sorry), NVDA, AMZN, AMD, CRM, COST, RIVN (RIP), AVGO, VOO (ik not a stock) <-- I know semi(s) are very cyclical but i believe in holding all of these companies for 5-10 years, so I don't have to worry about temp. earnings beats/misses etc. Much easier to pick a stock and hold it for a while then it is to get the timing right. Roughly at 175% return in the past 3 years. (hammered META at $100's, NVDA at $200 both in 2022) Roughly 15% of my bets are moonshots (note the word bet hehe) with promise but objectively could be overvalued/bad investments: CCL/RCL (both are crushing it and between them own 75% of the cruise line market), LCID/RIVN (going to 0 bc they can't scale profitably or will make u a very happy person 3 years down the line bc R2/Atlas at 45k/50k should capture a significant portion of model y demand), TTD, DKNG/FLUT - gambling hasn't even been legalized in Cali/Texas (the biggest markets in the U.S. come on), RBLX (feels like betting against youtube in the early innings w/o realizing how much rev. they're actually recognizing), PYPL (value - cheap af (bought at $60) should turn around in a couple years) I joke I allocate like google's budget where it's 90% bread&butter and the rest are moonshots. Was very depressed (still reasonably depressed) because I'm not sure how much time my dad has. I hope in a way I can pass some of these stocks to my kid in a better place than I found it.

"Advanced Micro Devices to See Continued Share Gains in Notebook, Server Processors, Morgan Stanley.csv","Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is poised for continued share gains in notebook and server processors through 2025, according to Morgan Stanley's analysis of the company's product roadmap. Morgan Stanley anticipates that AMD's core business will ""accelerate meaningfully"" as the PC market continues to recover and server upgrades resume. The investment firm noted that AMD is likely to capture a disproportionate share of these larger projects as upgrades progress. AMD's increased Q3 revenue guidance of about $6.7 billion at the midpoint reflects ""strong momentum across compute businesses,"" according to Morgan Stanley. This momentum underscores the company's effective strategy and execution, positioning it well for sustained growth. Artificial intelligence is also expected to be a significant growth driver for AMD. The company's advancements in AI technology and its strategic roadmap place it in a favorable position to capitalize on the burgeoning AI market. While there are potential delays in the deployment of new AI silicon, the overall outlook remains robust. Morgan Stanley maintains an equal-weight rating on Advanced Micro Devices and has raised its price target to $178 from $176, reflecting confidence in the company's future performance. AMD's strategic positioning and continued execution of its roadmap suggest a promising trajectory. As the PC market recovers and server upgrades accelerate, AMD is well-positioned to capture a significant share of these markets, driving further growth and reinforcing its competitive edge in the industry.",0.5943,POSITIVE,0.9953

AI chipmaker Cerebras files for IPO to take on Nvidia - But 87% of its revenues have come from the U.csv,"The Middle East wants chips badly but US restrictions prevent the US most powerful chips entering into certain geographical areas such as China and the Middle East; this entails the UAE. Nevertheless, the UAE wants in on the GPU chips craze and is apparently willing to pay anything to enter into the chip bonanza. The UAE can't get Nvidia's, AMD's, or Intel's best GPU chips so instead they are investing heavily into alternatives such as Cerebras. There is nothing inherently wrong with this but it's also the biggest red flag as an investment opportunity. If the agreements for Nvidia chips open up in the Middle East and specifically with the UAE that could be a crushing blow to this aspiring startup. Specifically, Cerebras Systems reported a net loss of $66.6 million for the first six months of 2024, on $136.4 million in revenue. For the same period in 2023 it has a net loss of $77.8 million on just $8.7 million in sales. 87% of this revenue for the first half of 2024 was directly from the UAE G42. The other red flag from this startup is the way in which they promote their business. It's all seemingly smoke and mirrors and conveniently based on outdated GPU pricing and throughput information; which is very publically available. For some reason, Groq and Cerebras love to keep using memory to unlock speeds on small/tiny models which is impractical and inefficient for a scaled system; or a system that is a large foundational LLM. As well, they have no clue what models will do next so it's a major after the fact architecture that uses llama because they have access to it. https://cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebras-inference-ai-at-instant-speed. A prime example of this is OpenAI's GPT-o1 model that uses reasoning in coordination with its model capabilities. Because they are not being used on the forefront of this technology they don't know how or when a model's size, function, or needs will evolve into the future. All of this plus the pricing from OpenAI and Microsoft is coming down exponentially. For Example: They are referring to a 70b param model that shoves an entire model onto memory. They are going up against h100's which is a very old technology at this point. They make no reference to h200's let alone blackwell Because they are referencing such a small model the pricing model they suggest would be radically different for a 400b param model and forget about trillion param models which are coming next. They're not being truthful about tokens per s. As of today this is Azure GPT 4o and GPT 4 mini tokens per minute gpt-4o & GPT-4 Turbo global standard Model Tier Quota Limit in tokens per minute (TPM) Requests per minute gpt-4o Enterprise agreement 30 M 180 K gpt-4o-mini Enterprise agreement 50 M 300 As you can clearly see 30 million tokens per minute is 500k tokens per second and mini is 833,333 tokens per second. So i don't know why they are referring to 20 tokens per second or their 450 tokens per second seems way off. maybe they mean million. Even if that is the case and 70 b would be more like mini it is way higher than their limit. On pricing which they lay out a 3:1 input versus output is fine the price would be for mini which is a comparable model is roughly .10 cents (input) + .20 cents = .30 cents. Per million. for regular 4o it would be higher and let's face it GPT 4o is a far superior model than llama 3.1 3.33 dollar + 5 = $8.33 Source: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/ From this information what I can tell you is that what we just went over is pricing. it is not some guarantee for what a model produces per second. That shit is very random. What I can tell you is from GPT 4 to GPT 4 turbo to Gpt 4o the speed is dramatically better. GPT 4o mini is damn near real time. Take that for what it's worth. I am not saying they're being dishonest here but I am saying they are being very cheeky with how they advertise things. The company is currently being primarily supported by the UAE, with investments worth roughly $900 million for new AI supercomputers known as the Condor Galaxy series. Any growth here is singular to this source of investment and not driven by organic growth or usage. This is not a competitor to Nvidia but rather a temporary solution in the Middle East until chip embargoes are alleviated. The media here loves to use sexy headlines on non-technical verifications of what it is they are actually comparing. I.e. H100's are now old, or The fact an entity may need to serve millions of clients... No they are instead reporting self-prompting headlines from Cerebras that say things like our chips are 20x faster than Nvidia. Live Update: As I am writing and researching this topic it has just been reported by Reuters that the U.S. is setting a new rule to allow chip shipments to the Middle East including the UAE which is a boon to Nvidia and Microsoft. US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East Here are couple excerpts: WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), to data centers in the Middle East. G42, a UAE-based AI company with historic ties to China, has been a focus of those concerns. In April, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), opens new tab announced that it would invest $1.5 billion in the company, with plans to provide G42 with chips and model weights, sophisticated data that improves an AI model's ability to emulate human reasoning.The deal drew scrutiny from China hardliners in Congress, even though G42 said in February that it had divested from China and was accepting constraints imposed on it by the United States to work with American companies. LOL you can't make this up. Literally this just got reported by Reuters today 9/30/2024. This completely aligns with my argument above regarding the UAE-G42. With chips now entering into the Middle East from Nvidia and potentially others I don't know how this startup IPO makes it off the ground. I don't mean to be bearish but I don't think this is the time for them to raise an IPO without showing more progress. I could be wrong. As of now, I don't plan on buying any shares. Instead, I will be adding more shares into Nvidia because now this is bullish news for Nvidia.",0.5441,NEGATIVE,1.0

AMD CEO Lisa Su Says AI Is In Early Stages Of Multiyear 'Supercycle' 'There's Tremendous Need For Mo.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) shares are experiencing an upward trend after the company reported strong second-quarter financial results. Following the announcement, CEO Lisa Su emphasized that the chipmaker’s performance is being driven by a multiyear AI “supercycle.” What To Know: Recently, chip stocks saw a sell-off as earnings season approached, with investors questioning the timeline for significant returns on the massive investments in AI. This led to speculation that spending on AI might slow down. However, early earnings reports indicate that capital expenditures have remained robust. Su’s comments on CNBC’s “Squawk On The Street” Wednesday provide reassurance against slowdown concerns. She stated, “From the conversations that I have with our customer set and sort of the broader industry, we can see that AI is a multiyear, you know, I would call it a supercycle frankly. There’s tremendous need for more compute.” AMD reported second-quarter revenue of $5.835 billion and adjusted earnings of 69 cents per share, surpassing analyst estimates as its AI business continues to see accelerating demand. The chipmaker also updated its forecast, expecting GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion this year, up from the previous forecast of more than $4 billion. Su highlighted that analysts and investors are “hypersensitive” to minor quarter-over-quarter changes. She believes that the AI story should be viewed in a broader context, suggesting that the demand is extraordinarily high. “I wouldn’t be hypersensitive in those areas ... Are more customers using it? Is every enterprise asking for it? Are we seeing more applications on a daily, weekly, monthly basis? The answer to that is absolutely yes,” she said. “Everywhere I go, everyone wants to talk about how can we incorporate AI into our businesses faster and more efficiently ... this early in the cycle, there’s a lot of learning and experimentation, but definitely, there will be the return on the investment on the other side,” Su added. Although the return on investment isn’t “instantaneous,” it’s occurring very quickly. AI is already boosting productivity and enabling companies to bring better products to market faster. Su emphasized, “We’re investing today for the return in a couple of years, and I think that’s absolutely the right thing to do. That’s the way to think about these investment cycles.” AMD’s strategic focus on AI and its strong financial performance underscore its robust position in the rapidly evolving technology landscape, highlighting the company’s potential for sustained growth in the coming years.",0.5537,NEGATIVE,0.8673

Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year. This report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure. With Nvidia's earnings report on the horizon, AMD's results offer a useful benchmark. Although AMD has significantly underperformed Nvidia year-to-date, this could be an opportunity to turn the tables. Data Center Growth is Key Analysts predict AMD's data center revenue will reach a record $3.52 billion for Q3. In July, CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in strong revenue growth for the year's second half, driven by demand for Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. Earlier this month, AMD launched its latest data center AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, and investors are keen to see its performance. Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari pointed to sustained growth in AI infrastructure capital expenditure, a recovery in server CPUs, and AMD's ongoing market share gains.

"Apple reportedly seeks to lock out its competitors from TSMC's 2nm process, by booking all of its ma.csv","Apple has long been cozy with TSMC, the manufacturer of the chips that end up in ever-popular iPhone, iPad and Mac products. When you've got as much cash on hand as Apple does, it puts it in a favorable position to negotiate deals with the Taiwan-based chipmaker. Now it is reportedly seeking to lock in 100% of TSMC's bleeding edge 2nm production capacity, giving it a competitive advantage when products eventually make their way to the market. According to 9to5mac (via Extreme tech), Apple's chief operating officer met with TSMC bosses to negotiate terms to secure 2nm capacity. The report cites 'local sources', so there needs to be a pinch of salt here, but given Apple's track record of locking up TSMC's capacity, this would certainly come as no surprise. TSMC's 2nm process is currently scheduled to enter risk production in 2025, with volume production set for the second half of 2025. That means the upcoming iPhone 16 family with A18 chips will stick with 3nm, but it could mean the high end iPhone 17 Pro and Max could be the first in line to be built with 2nm technology. The specifics of deals between TSMC and its customers are obviously not made public, but it is widely accepted that Apple booked all of TSMC's 3nm capacity, at least for a period of time. These chips, including the A17 and M3 families made their way into the latest generation iPhone 15 Pros and MacBooks. That would make Apple's 2nm play unsurprising. It's easy to see why Apple would attempt to secure the maximum amount of 2nm capacity. It will give it an advantage over its competitors, as 2nm chips will allow Apple to pack in more transistors into a given area, leading to better performance or lower power consumption—if not both. Samsung has its own manufacturing capacity, and future Exynos chips will be built in-house, but 2nm Snapdragon and possibly Google Tensor chips may have to wait in line behind Apple. Even mega-companies such as Google and Qualcomm don't have the cash on hand to outbid big daddy Apple. It's not just Arm competitors that will be disadvantaged. Nvidia will want every possible power and performance advantage it can get as it dominates the market for AI processors, while AMD will also have to wait for access to the best nodes. Even Intel could find itself at a disadvantage given some of the tiles for its chips are manufactured by TSMC.

This isn’t just a stock, this is the Infinity Stone of Tech Stocks. 💎🦍 We all laughed when Intel fell behind, when AMD and Nvidia seemed like the Thanos of chips. But Intel is Iron Man, baby. Old, reliable, and gearing up for the comeback of the century. The Vision: Intel's long game is power efficiency, AI chips, and their 7nm breakthrough. You thought they were snapped out of existence? Wrong! They’ve been in the Quantum Realm, grinding to make sure they can snap the competition away. They’re about to snap their competition into dust. The Play: Options? You want 'em? Load up. Shares? Stack 'em. We’re not just hodling, we’re creating the next big moon mission. They’ve got Arc GPUs, Meteor Lake, and a battle plan to take down the chip overlords. THE BULL CASE: AI Chips: Think Wakanda tech. Ready to change the world. We’re all in this together. Remember how the Avengers fought against impossible. They may have fallen, but they’re about to RISE UP. 💎🦍 HODL. BUY. BELIEVE. Intel isn't just a stock. It’s a movement. The SNAP is coming. AVENGERS, ASSEMBLE!",0.5324,NEGATIVE,0.9156
"BEARISH NVDA Development Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Intel developing open standard AI Accelerator .csv","Full Article: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-giants-form-industry-group-120000567.html NVDA's current GPU (AIPU) market domination currently stands at 85-95% of the accelerator market. This is pushing profit margins to extreme levels, protected by a moat defended by CUDA and their consistent R&D in the space, leading to further chip advancements along inference and power efficiencies at a much faster pace than their competitors (AMD/INTEL in particular). This new open standards alliance (UALink Promoter Group) for the interconnect (a.k.a backbone) of server clusters challenges NVDA's own proprietary interconnect systems, but will likely not be able to compete with the new B200 line being delivered in the coming months, due to its extreme efficiencies across GPUs and clusters. However, this new alliance is interesting, and combined with the hyperscalers consistently developing in-house specialized chips for model training and inferences, we will likely see a gradual decrease of market domination over the next 2-5 years. Overall, this seems like a BEARISH development for NVDA",0.5448,POSITIVE,0.9841

Bloomberg Again Reports on Semiconductors With Flimsy Information on Secret Government Contacts.csv,"Usually, when things that are leaked with an intention the entity where the leak comes from is pleased with said leak. Not for Bloomberg though. Bloomberg actually accomplishes citing an anonymous source about on ongoing discussions related to chip distribution and subsequently takes that information to the White House National Security Council to ask them to comment. Here is the WHNSC's response. Bloomberg: US Weighs Capping Exports of AI Chips From Nvidia and AMD to Some Countries A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the talks but pointed to a recent joint statement by the US and UAE on artificial intelligence. In it, the two countries acknowledged the “tremendous potential of AI for good,” as well as the “challenges and risks of this emerging technology and the vital importance of safeguards.” The council responds with a no comment while directing them to a positive statement. To me, this greatly diminishes whomever the Bloomberg contact is. This is the second time that Bloomberg goes out of their way citing a leaky government source that on it's own merits isn't really that sensational at all. The headline is sensational the reality is not. The approach would set a ceiling on export licenses for certain countries in the interest of national security, according to the people, who described the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Officials are focused on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing appetite for AI data centers and the deep pockets to fund them, the people said. This isn't even news. Reuters reported on this a month ago with a much more neutral to positive tone. Which it is. Reuters: US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia to data centers in the Middle East.Since October 2023, U.S. exporters have been required to obtain licenses before shipping advanced chips to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.Under the new rule, data centers will be able to apply for Validated End User status that will allow them to receive chips under a general authorization, rather than requiring their U.S. suppliers to obtain individual licenses to ship to them. If you're tracking, this simply seems to be the 2nd half of that original conversation. There are already chip restrictions. Nvidia is already not delivering the most advanced chips to those countries. The framework proposed would allow Nvidia to deliver chips under certain restrictions and guidelines. Bloomberg acknowledges this towards the tail end of the article. While officials have debated the best approach, they’ve slowed high-volume AI chip license approvals to the Middle East and elsewhere. But there are signs things could get moving soon: Under the new rules for shipments to data centers, US officials will vet and preapprove specific customers based on security commitments from both the companies and their national governments, paving the way for easier licensing down the road. What I don't understand is why does Bloomberg like to make things salacious when they're seemingly not. There is 0 chips to parts of the Middle-East today, but the U.S. government is working on a framework that may relieve that. Reuter story from a month ago. The end. When you read the headline one would believe that they are already selling these chips to the UAE and they're not.",0.5344,NEGATIVE,1.0

For the US and European AI Software Sector the restrictions should be regarded as good news, because with less systems being sold abroad, they won't have to wait that long for their orders. Further it keeps the foreign competition from getting faster AI chips. This poses a massive advantage for US and European AI Software Producers.

Could PLTR go on a TSLA-like Run (70%) if Included in SP500.csv,"On June 7th, S&P 500 is set to rebalance and Palantir will be eligible for the third time. With the spotlight on AI and Palantir's continued strong performance, there's a very high likelihood it is included in the S&P, which could lead PLTR going on a Tesla-like run. First, let me break down why Palantir is a great candidate for inclusion. Inclusion in the S&P 500 index involves meeting several stringent criteria related to market capitalization, liquidity, financial viability, and corporate governance. For Palantir Technologies (PLTR) to be considered a good candidate for S&P 500 inclusion, it must satisfy these key requirements: Market Capitalization: A company must have a market cap of at least $14.6 billion (as of 2023). Palantir's market capitalization has been above this threshold for a while. Liquidity: Companies need to have adequate liquidity, with a high trading volume. Palantir's shares are actively traded, reflecting strong investor interest and sufficient liquidity. Financial Viability: The company must report positive earnings in the most recent quarter and over the last four quarters combined. Palantir has demonstrated profitability, reporting positive GAAP EPS in recent quarters (InvestorPlace). U.S. Based: Companies must be U.S.-based, with the majority of their assets and revenues derived from the U.S. Palantir fits this criterion, being headquartered in Denver, Colorado, and deriving significant revenue from U.S. operations. Public Float: At least 50% of a company's shares must be in the public float. Palantir's public float percentage is adequate to meet this requirement, with substantial institutional ownership indicating wide distribution among public shareholders Palantir meets all the eligibility criteria, the only which could be a problem is corporate governance, ie, the insiders own a lot of shares of the company; however there are tons of examples of other companies that have a similar structure. As many of you know, Tesla went on a 70% in the weeks leading up to and the month following its inclusion. However, it's not alone. Many other ""sexy/high-profile"" names go on epic runs when SP500 inclusion is announced. Twitter (TWTR) Inclusion Date: June 7, 2018 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $26 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on May 21, 2018, Twitter's stock increased by approximately 14%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, Twitter's stock increased by about 5%. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2019 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2019, NXP's stock rose by approximately 10%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, NXP's stock increased by around 6%. AMD (Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.) (AMD) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2017 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $20 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2017, AMD's stock increased by approximately 12%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, AMD's stock rose by around 9%. T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS) Inclusion Date: June 22, 2020 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on June 5, 2020, T-Mobile's stock increased by approximately 8%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, T-Mobile's stock saw an increase of about 7%. NVIDIA (NVDA) Inclusion Date: November 18, 2001 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $25 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: NVIDIA's stock saw a significant rise, roughly around 20-25%, in the weeks leading up to the inclusion. Month Following Inclusion: The stock continued to perform well, with an additional increase of around 10-15%. ""S&P 500 effect,"" is a real phenomenon and I think it's even more powerful with high-profile names like Palantir. As mentioned earlier, Tesla went on a god-like run in the weeks leading up to and after the announcement. And I think Palantir shares many characteristics with Tesla that may see it go on a similar run. Both companies have a very high-profile CEO. Alex Karp is loved by Palantir holders just like Elon is by Tesla fanboys, which leads to my most important point: retail ownership. Palantir has a significant amount of its shares outstanding owned by retail; if SP500 inclusion is announced and institutions have to buy shares it may create a similar move like Tesla's as most palantir fanboys won't sell. Like Tesla, they believe Palantir is changing the world (look at their subreddit). I think buying Palantir options is a great upside play with limited downside, depending on when you purchase your options. The inclusion announcement is on Friday after hours, so you could buy Friday before close or anytime this week and sell Monday morning if its not included for a minimum loss. And with options being so cheap, this could be a 50-bagger if it goes to 30 bucks. 6/21 23 C 6/21 25 C.",0.5557,POSITIVE,0.7174

How Terrifying is the Start of August.csv,"Just over the past three trading days, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 indices have all recorded their largest three-day cumulative decline since June 2022! Last night, the Nasdaq plummeted by over 6% at one point, and the S&P 500 dropped by more than 4%, with both indices returning to their early May levels by the close of trading. Although the major U.S. indices and individual stocks still closed with significant losses, the intraday declines were somewhat moderated. The primary reason for this was the release of the U.S. July ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, which rebounded from a four-year low in June to 51.4, exceeding market expectations and returning to the expansion zone above 50! Sub-indices, including the New Orders Index and Employment Index, also showed growth. Notably, the Employment Index reached 51.1, marking the largest increase since September of last year and the first time this year that it has entered the expansion zone above 50. This data slightly alleviated fears from last week's significant non-farm payroll decline, making the market believe that the drop in new jobs was primarily due to Hurricane Barry hitting Texas. 👉 As discussed previously, the sharp decline in U.S. stocks at the start of August stemmed from worries about the U.S. economy falling into recession. Therefore, when the ISM Non-Manufacturing number showed growth yesterday, it somewhat restored market confidence in the economy, helping to narrow the intraday losses of U.S. stocks. The U.S. stock market now needs to see positive economic growth news to recover, unlike before when everyone was hoping for bad news, anticipating a Federal Reserve interest rate cut! Hence, it is crucial to continue monitoring other economic data. If strong and robust growth numbers do not consistently appear, investors will remain concerned about an economic recession, and the trend of selling stocks for cash will not end. The VIX Fear Index is a crucial indicator to observe market sentiment calming down.

I wait all year for this opportunity - now I'm going to share it with you.csv,"If you trade long enough, you begin to see patterns emerge. On October 30th, one of my favorite patterns is starting. If you buy AMD stock on the last Monday of October, the average return for the rest of the year is 24.52%, and the stock is higher 88.89% of the time. This data starts in 2015 because it is the first full year after Dr. Lisa Su became CEO of AMD. Some of you may be wondering why this period is so strong for AMD stock. Let me share my personal theory. AMD depends on TSMC for chip manufacturing. Taiwan is protected by its geography and weather, but the Chinese have two windows of opportunity to cross the Strait with favorable weather. The first is from late March to the end of April. The second is from late September to late October. Last year, China launched major military exercises around Taiwan in April. This year, they did it in October, which just ended a few days ago. (They also launch these exercises when they are provoked, such as when Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan or during the recent Taiwanese elections.) In my view, the end of October triggers a relief rally in stocks related to TSMC, most notably AMD and Nvidia. This combines with earnings and strong seasonality, resulting in massive outperformance in a relatively short period of time. A quick word of warning—this time period includes earnings. If you want to avoid earnings risk, you can wait until the first Monday of November. If you wait until November, the average return is 19.06%, and the stock is higher 77.78% of the time by the end of the year.

In INTC I trust.csv,"I've shifted my entire S&P 500 holdings into Intel, and here's why: The AI Revolution: NVIDIA currently dominates the AI technology landscape, and that’s indisputable. Their unmatched tech and visionary leadership have set the bar high. However, with the U.S. aiming to maintain its global leadership, relying on a single company for AI tech could become a security risk and a bottleneck in innovation. Why Intel Could Be the Game-Changer? Intel (INTC) is uniquely positioned to disrupt NVIDIA's monopoly. Alongside AMD, Intel possesses the expertise and resources needed to engineer AI chips. Enter Gaudi 3. If Gaudi 3 lives up to the hype, Intel’s stock could potentially skyrocket, doubling in value in a matter of months hands down. Government Backing: The U.S. government and major institutions are already showing their support for Intel, recognizing its strategic importance in the tech race. Positive Vibes: Reviews for Intel's Arrow Lake architecture are rolling in with strong positives, indicating that Intel's on the right track to regain dominance.

Intel was seen as a bargain in 2023 compared to NVDA and AMD after their 400% run up. US gov have vested interest in Intel. No they are not propping Intel up, but it's effectively giving Intel a big loan to buy a second house. That loan can pay off if the housing market goes up, or they are double fucked because they leveraged to buy a second house. If you bought Intel because china will invade Taiwan, you are really regarded. If China invades Taiwan, everything is going to sell. That's a disruption of global trade on WW2 levels. Your best case scenario still loses you money. Intel bullish scenario is 18A, High-Na EUV paying dividends, early experience granting them a year technological lead over TSMC. It doesn't have to work, but the upside is a 10x from these levels. TSMC pass up High NA EUV is repeating the same decision Intel did in 2012 when Intel controlled the market and did not view EUV as economically feasible. Again, doesn't mean TSMC is incorrect in their assessment, but history does repeat itself. Intel bearish scenario is just repeat of 2016 and delay after delay.

Intel - Pinnacle of failure.csv,"Intel's Slippery Slope: Financial Woes, Investor Distrust, and Leadership Issues Intel Corporation, once a dominant force in the tech industry, is now grappling with a series of significant challenges that have fueled a troubling decline. Despite attempts to project a positive outlook, the company’s current trajectory suggests a troubling downward spiral. Financial Performance and Market Challenges Intel's financial performance has continued to deteriorate. For the first half of 2024, Intel reported revenues of $24 billion, marking a slight decrease compared to previous periods. This decline is occurring amid a broader tech sector recovery and highlights Intel’s struggle to maintain its competitive edge. The company's net income for this period was a mere $800 million, translating to a profit margin of approximately 3.3%, indicating substantial operational inefficiencies and intense competition from rivals such as AMD and NVIDIA. Declining Customer Satisfaction and Product Concerns Customer dissatisfaction remains a critical issue. The release of Intel's 14th Gen Core processors has not addressed the performance inconsistencies that plagued previous models. While the company has introduced new features, reviews suggest that these updates have not significantly improved reliability or performance compared to competitors. This ongoing issue is eroding customer trust and impacting market share. Eroding Investor Confidence Investor confidence in Intel is faltering. The recent involvement of Apollo Global Management has raised concerns, particularly following Apollo’s controversial investment decisions in other sectors. Additionally, a recent lawsuit filed by major institutional investors alleges mismanagement and failure to deliver on key performance promises. This legal battle has further shaken confidence, prompting several large investors to divest from Intel, exacerbating the company's financial strain. Leadership and Legal Troubles Intel's leadership is facing intense scrutiny. Recent high-profile exits, including the departure of several senior executives, have led to a perception of instability at the top. The company's reliance on legal strategies to address its challenges, rather than focusing on operational and strategic improvements, appears to be aggravatinh its difficulties. This reactive approach is not addressing the underlying issues affecting Intel’s performance. Future Prospects and Potential Downturn Intel’s future prospects remain uncertain. Despite a significant $15 billion R&D budget, the company’s progress in key areas like AI and autonomous driving lags behind that of its more agile competitors. Moreover, while short-term production issues in Taiwan have provided some temporary relief, these are unlikely to reverse the long-term downward trend. The competitive landscape continues to evolve rapidly, and Intel’s slower adaptation could hinder its recovery prospects. TL;DR Intel’s current strategy, which includes overhauling its product lineup and executive team, appears to be a desperate attempt to stabilize its position. For investors and stakeholders, the warning signs are clear: Intel’s challenges are substantial, and the company’s efforts to turn things around may not be sufficient in the face of ongoing and evolving issues.

Intel is a good buy.csv,"We are all well aware Intel is having it's own Boeing moment right now with design flaws in their CPUs and horrible customer service. They deserve the steaming pile dooky that is currently sitting atop their share value. That being said, they have an ace that may flip the entire market on it's head: They own their fabs. That's right: all the other big boys in town design and give their blueprints for TSMC to manufacture. That's true of AMD, Nvidia, and other ARM and mobile chip designers. Intel is the only large scale chip designers that is more or less vertically integrated. As you may know, they just got $8.8B from papa Biden to build more foundries in Ohio and Arizona, in addition to their other sites across the world. None of this is particularly noteworthy until you consider that China has always been very interested in Chinesing Taiwan, and are even more so now that they have been embargoed from Nvidia chips by the US. The Chinese military build-up over the past decade has focused heavily on amphibious warfare, and long range anti-naval weapons (think carrier buster ballistic/boost-glide stand off weapons.) It doesn't take a Ph.D in geopolitics to understand what the move is here. On the US/allied side, the discourse around Taiwan has slowly shifted: what started out as ""we have overwhelming force and we will stop any attempt at an invasion of Taiwan"" has become something like ""Maybe we can't stop them from invading, but we can make it a Pyrrhic victory"". This may actually be the case, but the trend is not great. You will have noticed Taiwan has been increasingly politically isolated, mirroring the growing Chinese military power in the region. So what happens to TSMC if Taiwan gets Chinesed? As you can imagine, China is interested in acquiring as many TSMC assets and personnel intact as possible. This means you can bet your degenerate bacon that US intelligence services have contingencies to extradite key scientists and engineers, and scuttle the production plants and machines before the Chinese can take control of them. But the result is easy to predict: no more TSMC. This means the personnel extradited will be used to advise and run US production plants owned by, you guessed it: Intel. Intel will have a quasi monopoly on chip manufacturing. The US government see this of course, that's why they are strongly nudging Nvidia to play nice with Intel, because they see a potential future where Intel is the only player in town capable of making Nvidia chips, or any consumer chips at all for that matter, in the West.

Intel is a pretty safe bet and are undervalued.csv,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs. An additional benefit is that Intel can leverage their fabs in order to achieve higher margins for their own products. It's possible Intel's stock could be hit again in a month or so when their report comes out, but they are likely already at bottom.",0.5493,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Is INTC undervalued .csv,"Valuation Analysis of Intel Corporation Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has long been a key player in the semiconductor industry, but recent market developments and the rise of competitors like AMD and Nvidia have caused its stock to significantly underperform relative to its peers. As of Q2 2024, Intel’s total assets amount to approximately $182 billion, with liabilities around $91 billion, resulting in a net asset value of $91 billion. Yet, its market capitalization is around $95 billion, reflecting an almost 1:1 ratio between market cap and net assets. In contrast, competitors such as AMD and Nvidia trade at significantly higher premiums, indicating that the market may be underpricing Intel’s growth potential. Company Market Cap (Billion $) Net Assets (Billion $) Price to Net Asset Ratio Intel 95 91 1.04 AMD 266 56.5 4.71 Nvidia 3,000 58.15 51.58 Understanding Intel’s Valuation The Price to Net Asset Ratio (P/NAV) is a critical measure of how the market values a company relative to its net assets. Intel's current P/NAV of 1.04 reveals that its market value is nearly identical to its net assets, a valuation that appears surprisingly low, particularly when compared to its competitors. AMD and Nvidia, for instance, demonstrate P/NAV ratios of 4.71 and 51.58, respectively. This significant gap highlights the possibility that Intel is undervalued, especially given its strong fundamentals and growth potential. Several factors support this assessment. Despite facing fierce competition, Intel remains a leader in the semiconductor industry, known for its quality and innovation. The company is making substantial investments in new technologies and manufacturing capabilities, positioning itself to capitalize on growing trends such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, Intel boasts a robust balance sheet, with total assets of about $182 billion and liabilities around $91 billion. This financial strength provides a solid foundation for future growth and strategic initiatives. Although the recent decision to lay off 15,000 employees might seem concerning, it is part of a broader strategy to enhance operational efficiency and focus on core competencies, enabling Intel to adapt more effectively to evolving market demands. A key factor influencing Intel's future is the increasing global demand for semiconductors. As technology becomes more integrated into daily life, the need for high-performance chips continues to rise. Intel's resources and commitment to innovation position it to capture a larger share of this expanding market. Moreover, government support for the semiconductor industry adds another layer of potential upside for Intel. Given the strategic importance of semiconductor manufacturing in light of global supply chain challenges, particularly concerning the Taiwan-China situation, there is growing interest from government entities to bolster domestic semiconductor production. This focus on strengthening local supply chains can create favorable conditions for Intel, as it could receive both financial incentives and regulatory support to expand its operations and enhance its competitive positioning. Conclusion In summary, Intel Corporation is significantly undervalued based on its current P/NAV ratio. The company possesses strong assets, a history of innovation, and a strategic focus on future technologies. As Intel continues to execute its strategic plans and navigate market challenges, it has substantial potential to regain its competitive edge and achieve remarkable growth. Furthermore, the increasing government interest in supporting semiconductor manufacturing amid geopolitical uncertainties enhances Intel's prospects. The market's current valuation does not adequately reflect Intel's true value and growth potential, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

Only then, will the insane articles that read blatant idiocracy stop printing. Check out a few of the wild headlines below. Apple doesn't use Nvidia chips - Reuters Apple hasn't made shit with AI. It's like saying my local grocery store doesn't use Nvidia chips. Emojis' don't need H100's. Furthermore, which negates the entire argument, is that Apple had to concede to using ChatGPT which does use Nvidia. Just like they use Google search and Google maps and Outlook to make their phone actually viable based on some closed off crazy walled garden that nobody really appreciates. Nvidia will fall 50% - The Motley Fool AI has no ROI Yes it does AI is only good for Emoji's Meanwhile people are automating workflows as their core job with AI. Keep thinking this. Nobody is making money from AI Not true Google is building their own chips And they buy hella Nvidia chips AMD is competition Cuda We are building our own chips Where? We can't afford the chips because our car company isn't profitable so I'd rather invest in Dojo with Broadcom Ok - good for you ChatGPT lost 5 billion (but made 5 billion itself) Do you think they are just going to be buying chips forever? At some point the ROI will fully kick in. It is going to take 1 or perhaps 2 more foundational models to enter into the system before that happens. A Google search query uses 10x less energy than a GPT query Here is the thing. When I GPT something I don't need to browse 100 websites to get one answer. Has anyone thought of that? I bet if you redid the study and actually included the practicality of asking something and getting a direct answer they would tell you that is a large cost savings. AI is a bubble - My personal favorite Terminator say no The list goes on folks. What are we even doing here? It's time to pack up and go home. We are defeated, there is nothing left. But wait, are you telling me that on the call where Microsoft said their AI receipts were only 7% last q is because there was too much demand won't improve this quarter? I think not. You can banbet me for a lifetime if that number has not significantly increased to the likes of 9% - 10% or more this quarter. We are in the early innings folks. And all this ever was is a buying opportunity for the ages. Positions: MSFT, ARM, and a little Nvidia",0.5364,NEGATIVE,0.9998
Long-time AMD Holder (Cost Basis 1904) Starting to Sell - Anyone Else Disappointed in the Stock in 2.csv,"Wrote about my thinking below... Out of the 31 large banks, 25 have a “buy” rating and 6 have a “hold” rating on AMD 0.29%↑. It’s hard to think about why to sell when everyone is telling you to buy, but I am of the opinion that is when it should be most deeply considered. image credit to tipranks.com AMD has been my most profitable investment of the past 5 years, having risen 800% since purchased in August of 2018. For most investors (including myself), it’s difficult to part with winners. Not only that, I am someone who believes AI will proliferate throughout society in the coming years. Because they design data center GPUs, AMD should be one of the primary beneficiaries as the AI boom continues. It might seem counter-intuitive then to sell the stock here, but that is what I’ve begun doing over the past two weeks. I had high hopes for AMD this year, but it’s my view that they've failed to take significant data center GPU market share from Nvidia, and will have increased competition from Intel's new product offerings (on both client and data center), as well as proprietary silicon from large cloud players (Google, Amazon, etc). My original thesis was that AMD would profit from overextended Nvidia margins in 2024, but this underestimated the CUDA ecosystem moat that existed with Nvidia data center products (see Why I Got Nvidia Wrong). While most large cloud players want to diversify at least somewhat from Nvidia, they are still unable to do so without risking a competitive advantage with their own AI offerings. Add Intel into the mix, and the margin and market share pressure will be on AMD. The only player in the silicon value chain I think which can currently raise margins is TSMC (TSM 2.61%↑), but the geopolitical risk is too high for me to continue holding the stock (I sold my TSMC stake two weeks ago). On the PC (personal computer), Nvidia has always had a strong moat. It’s not just because they have the best performing products, but also because game developers are economically incentivized to optimize first (and often only) for the largest potential audience. This is similar to the moat CUDA protects on the data center side. One might think that Nvidia charging incredibly high prices for discrete graphics cards would cause them to lose share to AMD with consumers who directly purchase the products (as opposed to businesses who purchase the data center products). Yet Nvidia market share has only grown over the past few years. Data from Jon Peddie Research Why This Take Could Be Wrong: There is a lot of bullish momentum in the investor community around AMD currently from both professional commentators and retail investors (e.g. Twitter / X). Many people who had never heard of AMD 5 years ago are now saying to put money into the stock as it is Nvidia’s only pure AI competitor. As a result of this, AMD could see a dramatic rise on a positive earnings report later this month. In addition, I expect gaming revenues to surprise to the upside with the minor refresh of Xbox and Playstation consoles coming for holiday season. I still have ~260 shares of AMD remaining, and will likely hold to see if the stock jumps on the report. I think that AMD is extremely stretched in its current valuation (P/E of 205), and that any bad news could send it spiralling. Selling half of the remaining stake now is essentially a hedge against this possibility. Whatever happens with the earnings report, I will likely reduce my AMD holdings to zero in the next few months as I continue to lower exposure to companies reliant on Taiwan.",0.5591,NEGATIVE,0.9976

Market Recap Today 07 29 2024.csv,"The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed higher on Monday, boosted by anticipation around upcoming tech earnings. This optimism comes despite last week's selloff triggered by Tesla and Alphabet. Meanwhile, the Dow couldn't find its footing and ended the day in the red. Treasury yields mostly held steady, dipping slightly before the session's end as investors await the Federal Reserve's announcement on Wednesday. What’s up ⬆️ ON Semiconductor ($ON) soared 11.54% after smashing analyst estimates on both revenue and earnings last quarter. Revvity ($RVTY) rocketed 9.14% following stellar results that beat analyst expectations. Philips ($PHG) climbed 6.04% on strong earnings despite a sales dip in China.

Wells Fargo ($WFC) must face a lawsuit over sham job interviews Rate Cut Countdown — Will the Fed Finally Pull the Trigger? Nope, the Fed isn’t cutting rates this week. But don’t snooze just yet—this meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn’t overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy—he's searching for that ""just right"" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same. Inflation: Cooling Off Inflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year’s 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the ""last mile"" of inflation reduction. The message? We’re on the right track, folks. Unemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it’s taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell’s recent take? The labor market isn’t adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a “sweet spot”—balancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals. Risk Management Reboot With inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed’s risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle—slightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed’s past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they’re determined to act promptly to avoid a recession. Some Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it’s time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn’t seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first. The Fed’s balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31. McDonald’s: The Golden Arches Stumble By the Numbers Revenue: $6.49 billion (missed $6.61 billion estimate) Earnings per Share: $2.97 (missed $3.07 estimate) Same-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020) U.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7% International Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1% International Franchised Sales: Down 1.3% McDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening. Value Meals to the Rescue The fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn’t translated into higher overall sales just yet. Internationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk. Defying the Odds Announcing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away. Despite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a ""buy"" and none recommending a sell. Looking Forward The golden arches are taking a ""forensic approach"" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales. So, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future. On The Horizon Tomorrow Economic Data and Earnings This week is buzzing with key economic data, especially on the employment front. Tomorrow, we'll get the June JOLTS report, which stands for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. This report measures job openings, hirings, and separations (like firings and retirements), offering a detailed snapshot of the U.S. job market. The May report surprised everyone with an unexpected increase in job openings, suggesting a stronger labor market. This might just be the signal the Fed needs to consider rate cuts sooner than expected. Earnings season is heating up, and the first of the Magnificent Seven stocks reports tomorrow after the close.

However, Corning’s traditionally steady growth might not match these high expectations. If management doesn’t deliver impressive forecasts, a selloff could be on the horizon. Analysts are expecting $0.46 EPS and $3.54 billion in revenue. Paypal ($PYPL) faced a setback when Apple introduced a competing payment service in June. Nonetheless, PayPal remains robust, thanks to its strong e-commerce presence, Venmo's popularity, and its new checkout system, Fastlane. Optimistic shareholders are hoping for an earnings beat.

Microsoft’s Cloud Rain on Earnings Parade In a classic case of “so close, yet so far,” Microsoft ($MSFT) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, only to see its stock plummet over 5.79% in after-hours trading. Why? Investors fixated on the company’s disappointing Azure cloud revenue. Earnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints Microsoft’s revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure’s performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue—just shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub’s impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn’t enough to quell investor concerns. By the Numbers Revenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected Market Reaction and Future Outlook While the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft’s other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure’s growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn’t enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft’s shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500’s 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market’s laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters. Chips Ahoy! AMD’s Data Center Sales Surge 115% AMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let’s break it down. Earnings Breakdown AMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street’s expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter AI Chips and Data Center Dominance The tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company’s overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast. Other Segments and Market Reaction While the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD’s business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year AMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high. On The Horizon Tomorrow’s labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let’s be honest, they’re all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week’s job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes. Before Market Open Boeing ($BA): Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels.

My Analysis on ARM Holdings 2 Trillion+ Valuation.csv,"I believe ARM Holdings is slept on! I believe it could be the next NVIDIA. As of this writing its Market Cap is sitting at $142.36 Billion. I believe that its market cap should be ATLEAST 1 trillion due to the fact that it has an enormous market share of damn near if not more of 95% of the worlds smart device chips. What makes ARM unique is its business model. Their primary source of revenue is from the leasing of the design of the instruction set of computer chips. For those who dont know the instruction set is often referred to as an instruction set architecture (ISA), is a group of commands for a CPU in machine language. These commands tell the processor what operations to perform. Each instruction in the set specifies a particular operation to be performed on a specified set of data operands. The instruction set is fundamental to the design and functionality of computer chips, dictating how software communicates with hardware... So what is unique about this? Well I will tell you, these instruction sets are incredibly energy effecient compared to what is used currently for AI such as RISC or X86 etc. Currently NVIDIA is soaring because of the AI craze and its success has put light onto AMD, INTEL, SMCI etc but I believe ARM is a sleeper in my opinion. Their main source on revenue is through the royalties it recieves for leasing its designs. They can easily raise the royalty rate to increase their revenue stream anytime but there are some downsides. There customers could leave them and use other options. I dont think that is going to happen because lets face it their intellectual property is far better than any of the competition in terms of effeciency. AI is growing rapidly and one key expense is going to be energy consumption. Especially in these data centers. To my knowledge most data centers run on chips that use x86 from Intel. Those chips using that instruction set uses alot of energy. I believe data centers are looking to convert to a more energy effecient chip and when they do.... ENTER: ARM. Arm is currently used in almost all smart devices because again they are energy effecient. Why do we have longer battery life in a smart phones? Its because of ARM. What chips do electric cars use? ARM what instruction set does your microwave, fridge, washing machine use? ARM. Currently ARM is all over the portable device market but once they hit the data centers I believe there revenue is going to explode and therefore the market cap. There are major catalysts going down right now such as Microsoft partnering with them to make ARM based laptops and NVIDIA collaborating with them to make computers, not to mention that Tesla ordered a ton of NVIDIA chips that use ARM architecture. But my most bullish thing about ARM is what Jensen Huang said at Computex. He said that AI will eventually become physical in terms of robotics. Do you think those robotics need a energy sucker of a computerchip instruction set? No, the need the most energy effecient tech in todays age and that where ARM steps up right again. Currently we only use AI remotely (Chat GPT, Picture Generators, Etc.) but once we put AI into something physical and tangible such as robots to do everyday tasks those devices and robots need to run on the most advance and effecient software. I am currently looking at an outlook of 5-15 years and I am long on my position is this stock. We all seen what nvidia did and can only imagine what the next stock can yield the same returns and I think its ARM Holdings. Imagine going back to 2017 and investing into NVIDIA when the markect cap was the same as ARM now. Those returns look nice right if you have invested then. The time is now. Please keep in mind that i have not decided to go completely in depth of all of my research on ARM Holdings so please do your own. Also, I purposefully did not go into fundementals such as earnings and revenue on this. This is just my personal long term outlook on the research I have done. There are plenty more catalysts and risks out there so please DYOR. Feel free to comment!",0.5404,POSITIVE,0.9991

April 2024: I am now a reformed bear continuing bull strategy from the first 6 weeks: S*P drop 5.4% through April 19 - higher than expected inflation date. Push rates higher, lower # of anticipated rate cuts. I got hammered trying the same call strategy. Gave away 15k if not more. May 2024: AI AI AI every time you say AI in your earnings call the price goes up $1. S&P up 5.96% June 2024: News Report: tech doesn't even need a rate cut to continue the bull run.

My thesis on INTC going into 2025.csv,"I am going to add my technological and geopolitical fundamentals here, because I think these are going to be important factors heading into 2025. Disclaimer: I own 575 shares of Intel at an average PpS of $29.30 I think most analysts are forgetting that the next president is the same guy who is trying to block the acquisition of US steel by Nippon steel at all costs, regardless if it makes financial sense or not because he wants to retain as much American Manufacturing as possible and wants it to succeed. Most of the ""AI revolution"" has happened over the past 4 years where the administration had no problem letting foreign chip manufacturing take the lead. Intel is competing with TSMC, and TSMC receives massive subsidies and discounts from the Taiwanese government which dwarf the 7.9B (which was even reduced) from the US government. On top of that, the US government is also giving slightly less in subsidies, 6.6B, to TSMC to build in the US. So really, the current administration is not giving Intel an advantage over TSMC. The most effective thing that they could do is levy tariffs against Taiwan, which the next president has gone on record stating he wishes to do, instead of subsidies. This would increase demand for American chip manufacturing; while TSMC can manufacture in the US, CoWoS packaging is done outside of the US, in either Malaysia or Taiwan, and would cause the product to be subject to tariffs. In the chip design space, Intel is hopelessly behind on GPUs compared to Nvidia, and now Apple, Amazon, OpenAI and others are designing their own chips and using TSMC for manufacture. Intel still dominates the CPU space, but your average datacenter rack might have 10/20+ GPUs for each CPU. AMD is also a viable alternative to Intel for CPUs, and as such takes about 25% of the market. Intel's only way to compete in the GPU space is in the cost performance market, which mainly targets budget gaming, crypto mining, and cheap datacenter. The newest release of the ""Battlemage"" B580 is expected to compete with Nvidia's 4060 at the under $300 MSRP market, which are lofty goals. Nvidia and AMD still have offerings in these spaces but they are not lucrative ones. So Intel is basically competing to be a 3rd rate designer in the US, while they still have the CPU lead it matters a lot less for the lucrative markets right now. It's clear that on the design front, Intel is not going to receive much help to be successful. While this is their core business and majority of revenue, it is a business they are falling behind substantially compared to others. Design demand is GPUs and they are late to this party. Revenue for products is expected to stagnate or decline unless they have a competitive GPU offering. However, the US needs to have a domestic cutting edge chip manufacturing supply chain. It has expressed as much as a result of the 2022 supply chain shortage when we realized that letting TSMC manufacture 90% of the world's sub 5nm chips was a bad idea. That was the motivation behind passing the CHIPS act; Pat Gelsinger was instrumental in advising the current administration for this. The method for doing so has left a lot to be desired; Pat himself even expressed as much given the delay in fund disbursement, which in all fairness was only accelerated as a result of the election result and comments from republicans that they wanted to repeal the act. TSMC is not allowed to have the latest node fabricated in the US by law of the Taiwanese government. This is so that the country keeps its ""Silicon Shield"", the dependence globally to have manufacturing be done there which keeps Taiwan protected from China. But Intel has no such limitation. And TSMC is not able to fufill 100% of the orders for its customers; it is aggressively building more fabs to keep up with the ever increasing demand of AI. This demand exists for Intel to take part of. So, Intel in the next administration will have a tremendous amount of support for its Foundry, not Products, side of the business. This leaves Intel with a potential alternative to many of the scenarios analysts predict: It could solely dedicate to Foundry and sell off its Products division, most likely to AMD which shares the x86 architecture already and is solely focused on design. This would allow Intel to become a Foundry for external customers without having a conflict of interest, which I suspect is keeping them from customers. The CHIPS act stipulates that Intel has to retain a majority stake of Foundry but NOT Products, so this does not prevent Intel from dedicating itself to Foundry, which is what the US wants. I think Pat was waiting for the right climate to do this and it is coming soon. It is sad he did not stay long enough to see it happen. If Intel received the same amount of support from the US government that the Taiwanese government gave to TSMC, and was able to win external customers as a result of Tariffs, it could become the US TSMC. Much of this hinges on the 18A and later 14A nodes which are competitive with TSMC 2nm, which is the current cutting edge. But I think this is the desire of Intel and the next administration, and so they will work towards this goal. To diminish foundry would be a slow death for Intel. That is why I am still looking forward to Intel in 2025. If you got this far, thank you for reading. EDIT: Now that I think about it, it is also entirely possible for Qualcomm to buy Intel's Products division. I think they expressed as much earlier this year, but being they are primarily ARM I am not sure if it would be a good fit.",0.5359,NEGATIVE,0.9956

It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four...

NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming Latest Sept 2025, with my guess, Jensen starts marketing from first half of 2025, and wider release commercially of NVDA CPU for 1st qtr of 2026, March, me thinks Jensen starts getting market ready all of 2025 for release in the wild September 2025 for retail user and full wider release by March 2026 / end of February 2026. Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?.. I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip.

Nearly every other chip designer abandoned fabs because businesses operate best when they focus on what they do best. Intel is unique in that it is set up to transform the business into a major foundry model going forward. That takes decades of investment which Intel is ahead on.

NVDA has been all the rage and justifiably so.csv,"Since NVDA reporter its Q1 2023 earnings, revealing huge demand for AI chips, the stock has surged to $3.3T. Revenues 4x, margins up expanded and everything seemed perfect. Bulls claimed the stock was getting cheaper to decelerating growth. Quarterly revenue growth has dropped from 88% to 34% to 18%, heading towards single digits. Next quarter we’ll see just 7%. All of the marginal buyers are in — sucking the last few retail buyers in with the lure of a split. History suggests short term bump after a split as we are seeing, but now institutional investors have a vast pool to distribute their shares in coming months. As the saying goes, “when the ducks are quacking, feed them.” If the quarterly revenue growth continues to moderate, earnings growth will be impacted as well — making the stock become more and more “expensive” (multiple screams higher) versus the theme of last year when the higher it climbed the “cheaper” it got. This does not change the fact that it is a great business with a great leader — which will play a role in the advance of AI technologies and productivity. It’s just going to be a heavy lift that it retains a perception of greater value than Amazon, Microsoft or the entire German Stock Market Capitalizations (where it trades now). NVDA is still a semiconductor company, which has never been a secular business — it’s cyclical. Always has been, always will be. As for 70% gross margins, as Bezos famously said, “your margin is my opportunity.” NVDA has not cured cancer. There will be more and more competition going forward. Intel’s Gaudi 3 is 50% faster than NVDA’s H100 and 40% more energy efficient. AMD is gunning for them.

And then we have a rich, a very aggressive cadence of Falcon Shores products following that. We also added the Gaudi 3 PC IE card to it, this use case of Xeon plus an accelerator or Gaudi accelerator is getting very good response from customers as well. So we'll be bringing that out later this year. But the real story is delivering the TCO value, delivering the enterprise use cases.

"NVDA will hit 5T market cap in 2026, and 10T market cap before 2032.csv","Hi regards, This is not a ""copium"" post about the recent stock price drops. I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest. The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY. First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"". Name Stock price EPS SP/EPS ratio AAPL 230 1,4 164 MSFT 413 2,95 140 AMD 145 0,16 1.035 META 516 5,16 100 AMZN 171 1,26 135 NVDA 116 0,68 170 As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price. But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list. AAPL Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits. How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new. But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more. MSFT They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are. They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy. They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office? AMD I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first. Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware. Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software. And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section. META They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value. ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS. AMZN The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL. NVDA AND OUR STAR CHILD. HOT TOPIC OF 2024. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company. Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?

Until we see an IPO for SexRobots Inc, we aren't in the late stage. At the moment we've got a handful of companies beating expectations because of AI revenue (good for Nvidia, long-term), and some beating CapEx expectations because of AI spending (good for Nvidia, short-term) The current situation Look at Nvidia P/E compared to its share price. We're halfway through the year. At the end of this fiscal year, Nvidia will be worth $180 at the midline of this trend. It is currently $113. That is a 57% return, 157% on an annualized basis. Nvidia is down 17% from its peak. Its hard to call the bottom, but yesterday we saw a major flash crash followed by a v back up. Much like the opposite of the ""blow-off"" tops that we see when the bull runs peak. Big volume selling, big volume buying. Big down, big up. I expect the fast bears used that to get out.

NVIDIA (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang Points to 1 Trillion Opportunity for the Company.csv,"Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the next few weeks until the US election would be “confusing” for many since no one could say anything with conviction about who is going to be in the White House. Lee said that the market is going to trade “well” into the upcoming Fed meeting where he expects “some” rate cuts amid the labor market needing support and positive inflation data. Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said: However, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive. For this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that a trillion dollars’ worth of general-purpose data centers will inevitably transition to accelerated computing. “We’re in a computer revolution,” Huang said, pointing out that the first wave of data center modernization is driven by generative AI, which he described as more than just a tool—it’s a skill. Huang also emphasized the need for “densification,” with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) aiming to make data centers more efficient by compressing them into smaller spaces. He discussed NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it. Nvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia. Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave. At Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range. Of course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.

Nvidia The only problem you're gonna have is that you didn't sell more.csv,"Introduction Alright, so Nvidia is crazy overvalued right now. Just check out its P/E ratio – it's sitting at a whopping 73.94. And that's not all. Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.55, and the price-to-sales ratio is over 42. These numbers are way above what you typically see for tech stocks and the semiconductor industry. There are two big reasons why Nvidia's stock might take a hit: growing competition and lowered margins. Growing Competition First off, the competition is heating up big time. 🔥 AMD's MI300 series is a beast, merging CPU and GPU on the same chip, which is great for performance and energy efficiency. This is super important for data centers and AI applications, and it could seriously cut into Nvidia's market share. AMD is coming in hot, and Nvidia might end up feeling the burn. Then you've got Intel with their Gaudi3 GPU, which is packing some serious performance and efficiency for AI and machine learning tasks. More people might start switching to Intel's GPUs, giving Nvidia a run for its money. Intel's Gaudi3 could be the ghost in Nvidia's machine👻 Lowered Margins Then there's Amazon, which is throwing its hat into the ring with custom GPUs for their EC2 instances. These GPUs are optimized for machine learning and AI, and they integrate perfectly with Amazon's cloud services. This seamless integration could mean less reliance on Nvidia's products, pushing Nvidia to cut prices to stay competitive. Lower prices mean lower margins, which isn't great for Nvidia's bottom line. Amazon could very well turn Nvidia's margins into margin call memes. 📉 Adding to the heat, TSMC is thinking about jacking up production fees for Nvidia. The chairman's plans to raise prices could eat away at Nvidia's margins even more. If TSMC hikes those fees, Nvidia might have to dig deeper into their pockets, and that could be a real pain in the margins. 💸 Link (06/04) So yeah, Nvidia's stock might be flying high right now, but with all this competition and pressure on margins, it might not stay that way for long. It's looking like Nvidia might be headed from tendies to tears if they can't keep up. 😂 TL;DR Nvidia is trading high, but AMD, Intel, and Amazon are bringing the heat. 🔥 Competition + TSMC price hikes = potential margin squeeze. Stock might go from 🚀 to 💥 if they don't keep up. 😂",0.5456,NEGATIVE,0.9812
Nvidia's Blackwell Delay Offers Investors A Chance To 'Add To Positions' says Goldman Sachs.csv,"Nvidia Corp (NVDA) finds itself at the center of tech speculation as reports have surfaced about potential delays in its much-anticipated Blackwell architecture. With tech giants like Nvidia often facing the heat of public and market scrutiny, the slightest hiccup can stir investor unease. But is this delay really a cause for concern, or just a blip on Nvidia’s otherwise smooth journey towards AI supremacy? According to a report by The Information, Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell chips might hit a speed bump, delaying their release by over three months due to alleged design flaws. These chips were set to ship later this year, boasting promises of up to 30x better Inference performance over their predecessors. Despite this setback, Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs advises investors to remain calm and continue with their current strategies. The delay, while not ideal, is unlikely to impact Nvidia's 2025 earnings power or its market dominance, according to Hari. “We expect there to be little to no impact on CY2025 earnings and, most importantly, the company's long-term competitive position.” Hari believes that any short-term volatility in Nvidia's fundamentals will be just that—short-lived. The Market Reaction: Opportunity or Overreaction? For those ready to jump ship, Hari's advice is clear: stay the course. Nvidia's stock might experience some turbulence, but the company’s strong footing in the AI market isn't going anywhere. “We would consider any near-term dislocation in the stock as an opportunity to add to positions.” Despite a recent 15% correction, Nvidia remains a top pick, firmly seated on Goldman's Americas Conviction List with a 12-month price target of $135, suggesting a potential upside of nearly 26%. Even with Blackwell’s reported delays, Nvidia’s projected 39% year-over-year growth in 2025 remains unchanged. Hari’s bullish stance is rooted in Nvidia’s role as a crucial player in the rapidly evolving AI sector, especially as the demand for advanced AI infrastructure shows no signs of slowing down. Implications for Rival – AMD Interestingly, while the Blackwell delays might appear as a dark cloud over Nvidia, there could be a silver lining for competitors like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (AMD). “We believe the market could perceive this development as a marginal positive for AMD — the only alternative to Nvidia today in Data Center GPUs.” Although the analysts say AMD is unlikely to overtake Nvidia due to Nvidia’s strong market position and AMD’s challenges in scaling operations, this situation could still present a competitive boost for AMD. What’s Next for Nvidia? In the tech world, where speed and innovation reign supreme, a three-month delay might seem significant. However, Nvidia’s legacy of innovation and market leadership paints a different picture. As Hari points out, “any impact to CY2025 earnings will be negligible,” and the temporary setback should not deter investors from seeing Nvidia’s long-term value. For now, Nvidia’s strategy remains rock solid. The potential delay, whether factual or exaggerated, is but a temporary hurdle, according to Hari. As Nvidia navigates this challenge, the market watches closely, with many investors seeing a buying opportunity amid the noise. For those invested in Nvidia's future, Hari’s message is clear: hold steady, as the AI revolution waits for no one.",0.5505,NEGATIVE,0.9994
NVIDIA's share price surge and the outlook for the AI arithmetic market bubble risk and rational lay.csv,"As NVIDIA's share price has risen sharply in the short term, many have begun to wonder if the industry is facing a turning point or if there is a bubble. From the perspective of the industry giants, GPUs, as representatives of A1 arithmetic chips, are currently far from meeting demand. We can assume that AI applications are still only in their infancy, and there has not yet been a particularly prominent Al burst application in the world. Analyse the results: The AI market is still at an early stage: AI applications, despite explosive growth in recent years, are still at an early stage. The arithmetic power required for current AI applications (e.g., big language modelling, autonomous driving, robotics, etc.), especially GPUs, is still in the pre-burst stage. The growth of Tesla and the robotics industry, for example, predicts that billions of robots will be needed in the future for arithmetic support. This means that there is a huge potential for growth in AI arithmetic demand over the next few years, especially in inferential computing. GPUs as core hardware for AI: GPUs play a key role in AI inference computing, especially in tasks that require high parallel processing power (e.g., deep learning inference, autonomous driving, robot control, etc.). Although there are already many GPU products on the market, overall, the demand for AI computing power is still in a state of oversupply, and the size of the AI computing power market is likely to continue to expand, especially in the ‘reasoning’ segment of the demand for this segment is the area of high computation, especially in the field of automated driving, cloud computing and so on. Personal view: NVIDIA's leadership in the GPU space is well recognised, but many are beginning to worry about an industry bubble due to the short-term surge in its share price. NVIDIA's dominant position: Currently, NVIDIA is the almost unrivalled leader in the field of AI hardware (especially GPUs), and its products are widely used in AI training and reasoning calculations, especially playing a central role in large-scale data centres and cloud services. NVIDIA's rising share price reflects investors' optimistic expectations about the potential of the AI market. Bubble Risk: As NVIDIA's share price has surged, the market has become sceptical about whether it is overvalued. NVIDIA's high valuation could lead to the formation of a bubble, especially if its products and technologies are not sufficiently digested by the market. While the AI industry is promising, the market is volatile in the short term and the rise of competitors (e.g. AMD) could change the market landscape. Therefore, investors and industry observers need to be wary of market overheating and short-term speculation. Core view: US tech giants (e.g. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook) are supportive of NVIDIA's technology, but they will also support NVIDIA's competitors, such as AMD, in order to avoid the arithmetic market being monopolised by one company and to ensure the sustainable development of the industry. Analyse the results: Rational rather than short-term profit-driven: the behaviour of these tech giants suggests that they are not simply pursuing short-term profit when purchasing AI arithmetic, but are planning the security and sustainability of their own development in the long term. By supporting competitors such as AMD, these companies avoid the risk of the market becoming too dependent on NVIDIA alone, ensuring diversity in market competition and technological innovation. This kind of rational decision-making is crucial to the healthy development of the AI hardware market. If NVIDIA dominates the AI arithmetic market without competitive pressure, it could lead to overpricing, affecting the interests of other tech giants. As a result, companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon prefer to ensure diversity and healthy competition in the AI arithmetic market by supporting competitors such as AMD. In summary: future outlook and risks Huge potential for AI arithmetic: The demand for AI arithmetic is far from reaching its ceiling, especially in the area of inferential computing, and the market demand for GPUs will continue to grow as robotics and autonomous driving technologies evolve. The adoption of AI technologies will generate even more demand for arithmetic power in the coming decades, especially in emerging technologies such as robotics and autonomous driving. NVIDIA's dominance and risks: While NVIDIA's dominance in the AI hardware space cannot be ignored, the sharp rise in its share price and high market valuation have raised concerns about the existence of a bubble. Future technological competition, especially the rise of competitors such as AMD, may affect NVIDIA's market share. Long-term layout of industry giants: U.S. tech giants are very rational when investing in AI arithmetic, they will not simply pursue short-term benefits, but pay more attention to the diversity of the arithmetic market and the sustainability of the technology, to ensure that they can be invincible in the competition in the coming years. The AI arithmetic market is full of great potential, but is still in the early stages of development. While NVIDIA occupies a leading position in the AI hardware market, its high valuation and share price volatility also make the risk of a bubble",0.5575,POSITIVE,0.7135
NVIDIA’s next catalyst has to be sovereign AI.csv,"NVIDIA’s current valuation is not overtly expensive (FPER: 33, PEG: 1.61 according to FINVIZ) and the GPU orders for next year are all booked. Yet the stock is meeting strong resistance around $130. I think this is partially because a lot of people have been burned by CISCO during dot-com bubble and do not want to price in the future too much. But the real concern is that their revenue is almost entirely dependent on the rest of M7 and they are charging the big tech 80 % margin. The big tech, while being hammered by Wall Street for the increased CAPEX spending, indicated during last earning that they will not reduce their investment on AI. However, they did mention that they are/plan using their NPU (Google TPU, Tesla Dojo, AMD) to reduce the usage of NVIDIA GPU. Furthermore, GPT5 and Apple Intelligence should be available to the public by the end of this year. If these do not impress, the entire AI sector may see significant slowdown. But if GPT5 shows plateauing of performance while people find Apple Intelligence interesting, paradigm could shift toward smaller models and inference efficiency, again reducing the demand for NVIDIA. To justify significant increase in NVIDIA’s stock price, they need to show that they are not entirely dependent on the Big Tech. The only other potential buyers that have as much buying power are governments. Also, if the economy is going through downturns, governments have excuse to increase their spending. What I am paying attention to during the earning call is demonstration from NVIDIA that they are receiving significant demand from non-Big Tech such as governments.",0.5529,NEGATIVE,0.9994

Short Call Strategy Am I Regarded or Might This Actually Work.csv,"Okay, so I'm guessing a good amount of us in this subreddit were new to options trading at some point in time, and when we were just itty bitty option noobs first hearing about them, we just thought: "" Wow! this is just the same thing as betting on stocks but with leverage right?"" (might just be me when I first got into options trading but whatever). Moving on. I assume that many people's first instinct was to go and buy a call on a stock they were very bullish on. And I would assume that once we did that, we lost the entire position because we never knew how theta decay, IV, DTE, strike price, and other factors could sink your entire position. The thing about these factors is that when you buy a call, the majority of these factors are stacked against you, and if you don't want them to be completely stacked against you, you gotta pay up for a higher premium which is gonna yield the same or less of a return then the lower priced (but considerably more risky) options. You're paying for less risk. Long Calls are usually only profitable when the underlying has a significant enough uptick to outweigh all the other factors dragging down the value of the option. I'm sorry I don't mean to repeat the basics of valuing options but I think it's important to pretext them a little bit so my strategy makes more sense in the grand scheme of things. Okay, so my strategy is as follows: why buy a call, and have all of these factors stacked against you, when you can sell one, and have them work in your favor; I guess the whole basis is: the shittier the call, the better (meaning how likely it is to expire or be exercised with no value). The even better thing is we can magnify the shittiness to work in our favor on the sell side by selling balls deep out of the money calls, with low IV, and few DTE. And we can magnify this even further by selling calls on options with really shitty stocks underlying; stocks that are down 40% YTD, or just really, really stagnant not moving anywhere (might also get some sexy low IV to work in your favor there too). I don't really have any stocks in mind right now to lock this trade in off the top of my head, but $NOC and $AMD are quite down this last month and a half, and are relatively popular stocks. Like I said I need to find some better stocks for this Strat; these are not the ones I wanna go with, just what I thought of off the top of my head Now you might be saying two things: 1. ""The prices on them are probably gonna be pennies on the dollar. Sure the odds might be in your favor, but the yield is gonna be very low"", and 2. ""What fucking moron is gonna be stupid enough to buy these calls?"". To answer question 1: Why not just sell more calls? And to answer question 2: I don't think I need to illustrate the stupidity of individuals in the market, but if you need me to, here you go: WSB regards (not dissing, I am also a WSB regard who has lost thousands on YOLOs), teenagers with a Robinhood account that just found out about options, and maybe even people who are legit investors, but have bought the call as a part of some bigger options play, like a straddle, or iron condor (not to mention that in the example of the straddle, I don't think they would really give a shit if the call tanked because, well, it's a straddle lol, the put on the other side would cover the losses and make profit{and yeah there are probably more plays where this is the case that I am just forgetting about, but this is the example I'm just gonna go with for now}). Not to mention markets are huge and I've checked the open interest on some of these calls and there are hundreds going up to the thousands in open interest on balls deep OTM, 2DTE, Low IV call options. Anyways, I guess the reason I made this post is to double check with some options veteran (I've been into options for a little less than a year, but I have some knowledge on them from my job) to see if this strategy is complete delusional manic retardation, or if there is actually some substance to it. I wanna make sure there isn't some variable or factor I'm not accounting for that could tank this entire play.

The company also had stated that they want to supply 1000 liquid cooling racks per month, and increase their 1% market share to 15% within the next 12 months.

SMCI loose analysis and opportunity simmering.csv,"SMCI golden age and beautiful chart. After hours Friday SMCI jumped almost 9 percent! Makes perfect sense that investors are flooding back into this stock! It has been so beaten down over the last six months by bad press and fears of fraud. Those fears have been quelled by a new CFO and auditing team. We just saw in the last month of 72% rally and there is still plenty of room to run on Monday it will open up around $48, the last critical level we saw was $49. Also, it looks like a somewhat sloppy cup and handle pattern is forming. My half baked technical analysis is. We will see a minor pull back around $50 to finish the pattern, then it will launch back up to the next critical level around $60 a share. Fundamentally speaking, they have been showing plenty of growth and demand for their products which mainly consists of hardware to House semiconductors, especially their trademark marked water cooled rack, which directly addresses a huge issue that centers are facing as computing power gets to Skynet levels. Their price to earnings ratio is a modest 21.9, the earnings per share is a humble 2, the ps ratio is 1.5 which is the lowest among its competitors. In fact all of its metrics or lowest amongst its competitors except for the EPS for AMD, which is 1.1. There will be much to see within the next quarterly earnings report and how they managed to address their auditing issues and reporting issues. But I think this company still has room to run and definitely has legs. I have 200 shares with plans to buy much more. I was going to buy on the next red day, expecting it to be Monday, but I digress. Next pull back I’m buying calls with a strike price of about $49-$55 exp in March. Even considering a YOLO.

"SMCI will skyrocket soon, DONT MISS OUT!.csv","So currently SMCI is around the $840 to $850 levels but hit $775 on monday. This meant that there is still a chance to buy SMCI while the shares are cheap right before they release their earnings in a month. The reason why im bullish on SMCI is because AI is driving the stock to skyrocket as they work alongside Nvidia and AMD in providing data centres. Elon musk had also catapulted the stock to reach over $1000 as he had tweeted that he is partnering with Dell and SMCI to provide AI data centres for its generative AI chatbot. https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/super-micro-computer-ceo-post-picuture-with-elon-musk-at-ai-data-center-432SI-3505317 As a result of this, SMCI will most likely smash their earnings report of $8.10 per share in early august and hopefully make the stock reach above $1100, which is a 30% increase from what the share price is today.

SMCI.csv,"Hello fellow regards, Currently SMCI is trading around the $770 to $800 range and is crucial to the future of AI as they have partnerships with Nvidia and AMD, due to providing complementary AI server systems. Due to their partnerships, and the increasing demand for AI server systems, SMCI had their EPS increase significantly as their EPS forecast is around $8.00 per share, which is a major increase from last year, which was $3.51 per share. They also have a PE ratio that is lower than Nvidia and AMD at around 45, a foward PE of 21.79 and a PEG ratio of under 1. As a result of their PEG ratio being below 1, it means that the company is considered as undervalued, and a good investment to have. The stock is down 40% from ATH and i personally believe that it could reach over $1000 by their next earnings release which is in the end of july.

Strong AI and Semiconductor weeks ahead.csv,"Hi all, I think that AI and esp. Semiconductor Stocks have a couple of strong weeks ahead. Starting on Tuesday, October 15th 2024, the Open Compute Project (OCP) global summit takes place in San Jose, California. Between 9 AM and 11:30 AM there'll be short keynotes (each 12 mins) presented by Meta, NVidia, AI Clusters, Intel, AMD, Microsoft and Google (full schedule here). Now, I don't think that there'll be any big surprises. But the Summit still presents an opportunity for public remarks about how strong the demand is or what so ever. Also, there's an article that says that Broadcom (AVGO) is going to show case cutting-edge AI infrastructure. Further it is expected that Taiwan Semiconductor Company (TSM) and ASML Holding (ASML) will publish their Q3 earnings next week. TSM will present its earnings on October 17th 2024 at 14:00 Taiwan time / 02:00 Eastern Time. So pre-market movements will most likely be wild on Thursday as a large part of the industry relies on TSM. If TSM reports a great Q3 revenue, this could push Nvidia over the current all time high. Also according to Moore's law is dead, the first RTX 5000 series GPUs are ready to be sold, but are not released because of business reasons (here at 22:22). So they could still change their mind and ship in Q4. Next, it is rumored (by moore's law is dead) that AMD will release a new CPU by the end of October or early November, the 9800X3D which is an 8 Core Gaming CPU with 3D cache and it is expected that it will be the fastest gaming CPU releasing this year. Although Client is not as important for AMD, it will still be beneficial to have this CPU released before the holiday season. Especially since Zen5 Rysen has so far been viewed as rather disappointing. Moore's law is dead also mentions an RX 7650 GRE GPU, which could launch alongside Ryzen 9800X3D. Releasing a slightly refreshed and cheap RDNA3 GPU could be a good move by AMD to get rid of RDNA3 stock ahead of the RDNA4 launch in 2025. Since the Ryzen 9800X3D has not yet been anounced, I don't think that it has been priced in and could give the stock a slight boost to recover from the -4% last Thursday. Also, I although Investors were not excited about AMDs Advancing AI event, I think AMDs position in the market is still solid. According to the slides shown at the event, AMD Epic has increased its market share to 34%. And according to tests AMD Epyc Turin obliterates Xeon 6 Granite Rapids, while being cheaper. Because of this, I think AMD is in a good position to gain more server market share. Further, the news about Nvidia Blackwell being sold out for the next 12 Months is not only good news for Nvidia but also for AMD. Sure, everyone wants blackwell. but if one can't get blackwell and if AMD Instinct MI325X is faster than Nvidia Hopper (H200), then they might be able to win over customers from nvidia, who would like to buy blackwell but can't in due time. Also, AMDs earnings should be reported on October 29 2024. Due to Ryzen Zen5 being disappointing and there being apparently a large RDNA3 stock remaining. If AMDs Instinct systems are selling well, this would also be good news for Micron Industries (MU), which produces high bandwith memory (HBM3e). And then there's Intel. Their newest releases seem to have been disappointing. But they claim to be making progress with their foundries.

They are frequently gamers, so they need to buy NVDA GPUs and AMD CPUs. They often buy these at AMZN. They buy YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, so they can skip the ads of their fellow influencers (GOOGL) They spent most of their waking hours at META's Instagram website. They drive a TSLA or RIVN. They're on the GLP-1 drug (LLY) to impress their SOs. They're churning their credit cards with AXP Platinum and Gold, JPM's Chase Sapphire Preffered (no, NOT Reserve), some younger ones need to rely on COF's Venture and Venture X cards that gave nice ""subs"". They use these cards frequently to eat out and earn those points at CMG, SHAK and SG. They're flying a lot on DAL, and they need their free wifi that is often sponsored by their preferred choice of mobile carrier, TMUS. To get to the airport they need to use UBER or LYFT, since they don't want to drive their sweet electric ride. When they arrive at their destination airport, they pick up their rental car, and of course they prefer AVIS (CAR), but their credit cards give them presential circle status on HTZ, so they are ok with that too. They check into their hotel room at Marriott (MAR) to impress their friends, but really they are using all their Chase points to book Hyatt (H) hotels. The slightly less premium young ones will have to go Hilton (HLT) and fly on UAL. They often booked all this travel on EXPE or BKNG. Sometimes they use ABNB. When they check in they need to get some food, so they use their DASH gift card they bought at COST every two weeks because they get 20% off. When they go to Vegas, they prefer to stay in WYNN, because it's where all the hot ones stay. After they're done with their holidaying which they do basically 4 months out of the year, they're going to ULTA or LULU to buy their beauty products or Khakis. They are drop shipping on SHOP and sometimes they need to use ZM to conduct ""business"" for their ""coaching classes"" that they teach. A lot of times they get paid using Venmo (PYPL).

"The next tech giant Why HOOD, PLTR and DKNG are the investment opportunities of a lifetime (Part 1).csv","I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong. $AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice. $NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were. And so in true wsb fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB. There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long. From a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about. And so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry : If you are under 40 years old, $HOOD (Finance), $PLTR (Defense) and $DKNG (gambling) will 100x during your investment horizon.

The short report for Intel (INTC) - A rabbit hole of CPU failures rate since 2022.csv,"Forenote: Im a technical person, A developer, this will be a technical DD to show how intel is failing to do their basic business model of manufacturing CPUs. Over the past month or so Intels customers have been becoming increasing irrate about CPUs just flat out dying after various finger pointing from Intel being debunked. I first caught wind of intels failures when a friends system started to become unstable, he would crash in games and sometimes doing mundane tasks. It all came to a clicking point when his systems files started becoming corrupted and he needed to attempt reinstalling windows. The attempts failed, windows couldnt even install without corrupted files, sometimes it would install and look fine, but running a verification shows that various system files were still corrupted but not important enough for the system to boot successfully. He would still get various crashes doing mundane things and gaming. It was basically a working brick at this point. So i got my research hat on, and discovered various reddit users on r/pcmasterrace were also reporting instability with their PCs. Not alot tho, this has been the wierd thing, Intel has such a large CPU failure rate, but not alot of reports which caught everyone by suprise. It started to make sense, the causes of the crashes were different for everything. Users were reporting issues with Nvidia, Issues with RAM, and issues with corrupted data. Obviously to any layman, these issues dont instantly point to an issue with the CPU. With GPU errors, Nvidia initially got heat, but Nvidia quickly debunked the issue reporting the GPUs that were returned were fully functional and had no issues. So I pulled out my handy dandy debug tools since my friend managed to get windows installed and it kinda runs. The first tests I ran were memory block verification. This validates that the memory is able to hold data immutably, after 4 hours the tests finished all green, the memory was stable and wasnt corrupting data. (its worth noting that the memory test software I used was very CPU lite so the CPU has little chance to corrupt the data its self, this is a stark difference to the Drive tests I ran.). Since my friend was getting corrupted files almost everytime he install anything, I ran the disk debug tools, these pull the S.M.A.R.T data from the drive and run various read and write tests. The S.M.A.R.T data came back green, the drive was reporting it had no errors or irregularies and was functioning fine, So i moved to the read and write tests, all red, the drive had a 90% file currption rate, I pulled the S.M.A.R.T data again, All green, the drive was still reporting it was functioning correctly. At this point, anyone would deduce they had a bad drive that was misbehaving, leading to the decreased number of CPU failure reports. After all, How can you say the CPU is bad when you have corrupt files? Many people forget how much the CPU is responsable for. When you read files or write files, its the CPU that tells the Drive what to store and where and what to read and where it is on the disk to read it from. and as i said, the software I used to test the drives is CPU intensive, it uses the the CPU to generate random data to store on the drive and hashes that data to verify it. So a bad CPU = Currupted data on the drive. Luckly my friend has 4 drives, So I told him to take out the ""bad"" drive and put in another one, I ran all my tests again and same result, the drive was reporting it was functional, but all the data was corrupted. The result was the same with all the drives tested. Now, this is a luxary many people dont have. Many people would get corrupted data on their drive and think the drive is dying and get a new one. However with 4 tests samples all failing the same way when days ago they were all fine is a very low chance. Now for the kicker, Intel has a tool to verify that the Intel CPU you have is a genuine Intel CPU, I guess intel has a problem of china making fake intel CPUs??? Ive never seen any but what the hell, its a useful tools since its does some basic CPU level checks. So i ran the verifier tool and its first test for a genuine CPU comes back green, Cool, it is a real Intel CPU. Memory test comes back green (We alreadt tested this soo good), next was the Graphics tests. Failed, the CPU was attempting to send data to the GPU and it corrupted the GPU memory. So now we have 2 symptoms. Disk data corruption GPU memory corruption My friend has Nvidia GPU and Nvidia previously debunked any issues with their GPUs. But we have a common cause, Intel CPUs are corrupting data when sending it to another device in the system (except RAM), Data sent to a disk gets corrupted and data sent to the GPU gets corrupted, which would explain the game crashes. Various other tests passed from boost speed changing, Wifi tests and math operations. After I finished all the tests and determed the issue is with the CPU, my friend RMA'd the CPU. This is where more troubles start. Intel refused the RMA, citing user damage, According to intel all the issues my friend was having was his fault and he caused the damage, After it was refused, I filed the RMA for him, to the same response, but because im a stickler I pushed for more info, Intel was refusing the RMA because of overclocking done by the motherboard. This is a previous blame game intel played, they were blaming Motherboards for putting in stock overclocks on CPUs causing them to fail, but this wasnt the case with my friend, his motherboard wasnt even stock overclocked, but intel refused it anyway. After this point is when the waterfall started coming down, a advanced tech-youtuber posted an exposé about intels CPU failures. See: Intel has a HUGE problem - Level1Tech the curtains were starting to fall, Apparently Game developers and datacenters (Intels BIGGEST customers) were getting large amounts of CPU failures specificly with intel CPUs. Now datacenters are normally quiet about this type of thing, opting to sort their issues directly with intel, but intel is turning away datacenters RMA's of thousands of CPUs, these datacenters has since publicly reported they are dropping intel systems from their products and only supporting AMD systems from now on. Intel has lost their largest customer base, because of their defective products and refusing to take responsability for the product inherit flaw. Intel is hoping this goes unnoticed, since reports are still low of CPUs failing because the errors are random and different each time and users dont know their CPU is defective, there isnt a big in your face ""The Intel CPU in this system has errored"" its always an error with something else, which is caused by the CPU. So intel is betting on customers blaming other manufactures like they did with Nvidia when this all started. Timeline of events: [Dec 2022] The first instances of ""Out of Video Memory"" issues on 13th Gen Core i9 CPUs were reported back in 2022. (Source: Reddit). This is a few months after the release of Intel's 13th Gen CPUs & RTX 40 GPUs. [Throughout 2023] Several users have started reporting game crashes and issues in high-profile AAA titles such as Callisto Protocol and Hogwarts Legacy (among many others). Both tiles are based on Unreal Engine (released in 2023) and feature a shader compilation process at the start. There are currently thousands of such issues reported on Steam Community Forums and Reddit. [February 2024] A post by Sebastian Castellanos brings the issue to the limelight, highlighting the ""worrying trend"" of stability issues affecting 14th and 13th-gen CPUs. [February 2024] Our editor along with various other tech outlets start reporting the issue and bringing the matter on to the mainstream media. Quickly, it is pointed out that underclocking and undervolting the chips can result in better stability. [April 2024] NVIDIA Issued a formal statement that the stability issues are not related to its GPUs but rather Intel CPUs. [April 2024] Intel announces its investigation of the reports of instability issues affecting 13th and 14th Gen CPUs. [April 2024] Oodle Publishes about their discovery about users Intel systems experiencing data corruption. [April 2024] Motherboard makers quickly roll out ""Baseline"" power profiles in new BIOS, which lower power limits on high-end 14th & 13th Gen CPUs but also lead to significant performance drops. [May 2024] Intel releases a statement, recommending motherboard makers to ship ""Intel Default Settings"" in BIOS by default rather than customized settings. [June 2024] Intel discovers a bug within its eTVB microcode while investigating the root cause of 14th and 13th Gen Instability issues. This doesn't fix the instability problems. Board makers quickly roll out BIOS with a new microcode fix. [June 2024] Alderon Games publishes about there players, developers and servers Intel CPUs failing over a period of months and switch to only AMD systems. [July 2024] Intel denies an RMA to HardwareTimes editor who already RMA'd at least two CPUs which produced instability issues. [July 2024] Wendell from Level1Techs & Steve Burke from GamersNexus are the first big tech media outlets on YouTube to further highlight the instability issues, diving into additional details such as OEM frustration with the matter and a possible recall. [July 2024] GamersNexus highlights a potential ""oxidation"" defect being a problem with a certain batch of Intel 14th & 13th Gen CPUs that might lead to instability problems. [July 2024] Intel says the 14th & 13th Gen Mobile CPUs are not affected by the same instability issues as the desktop CPUs. [July 2024] GamersNexus reports they will not be recommending Intel CPUs regardless of the outcome for upcoming AMD 9000 series reviews [July 2024] Intel issues a statement confirming that they have found the root cause of the instability issues which happen to be elevated operating voltages and will be issuing a new microcode fix to its partners by mid of August [July 2024] Users are reporting instability issues with Intel 14th gen Laptop CPUs.

Edit: Ive received internal leaks from Intel employees explaining internal issues and intels failures. Source 1: The leading theory inside Intel right now, and it is just a theory, is that the Ring Bus is getting cooked because it's fed by the same rail as the P-Cores and E-Cores. Raptor Lake required incredibly high voltages that the clocks required to be competitive with Zen 4, and it seems like it was just pushed too hard. This is an inherent flaw that would be in Bartlett too it's overvolted. Meteor Lake isn't affected, and Emerald Rapids is unlikely be effected materially. Source 2: I never worked directly on Raptor Lake [Intel Design Engineer], but I did have exposure to Alder Lake, and I can confirm that they were very concerned about the ring bus getting damaged if the voltage was pushed too high. I can also confirm that Raptor Lake was rushed through the design and validation process... Source 3: I [Intel Foundry Services] can tell you that Raptor Lake was rushed through our Fab in Arizona in record time, but it's also produced in other fabs. However, this location (Arizona) is notable because I can confirm that there was an Oxidation issue caused by some failure in our HVAC system between March & June of 2023. It was so bad that Keyvan Esfarjani had to fly in to make decision about which wafers (which cost as much as a Model X each) needed to be thrown away. To be clear, I don't know what decision was made, but I do know that this event DID happen. And by the way, it affected Sapphire Rapids yields as well...although I doubt it's an issue that wasn't",0.5221,NEGATIVE,0.9929

RMA's are not cheap and the amount of money and time they are spending to fix the issue for existing chips while trying their hardest to deny RMAs for failed CPUs. Customers have lost faith in Intel, their chips are constantly beaten by AMD offerings and having a high failure rate really was the last nail in the coffin. Enterprise customers are switching, gamers are switching, datacetners are switching. All switching to AMD (or Arm - Yes Arm is starting to see some enterprise deployments, very little tho.) Intel will continue to have bad earnings for the forseable future (as they guided), And they also havnt announced (and likly wont) the delay of their next gen CPUs (15000 series) for desktop, they are expected to announce only Mobile chips and act like Desktop and server CPUs dont exist this generation. Delay is expected to be around 6 months (Q1 2025) the same time AMD is expected to announced Zen 5c and EPYC CPUs. I am still short, excersiced Options for short stock. up 2000% so far.

VSH - The Forgotten King of Chips.csv,"TLDR: $VSH (Vishay Intertechnology) is printing money while everyone sleeps on it. $VSH just got the stamp of approval from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, confirming it as a hidden winner in Nvidia’s AI and RTX 50 supply chain. With key wins in MOSFETs, capacitors, and resistors, $VSH is now primed for explosive growth, riding Nvidia’s dominance in AI servers and GPUs. If you’re not jacked up on $VSH, you’re not meant to have money. Who is $VSH? Vishay Intertechnology is a veteran in the electronics industry. They make essential components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and semiconductors. You know, the boring stuff that makes your GPU, PS5, and electric toothbrush actually work. They’ve been doing this since 1962. That’s right, this company has survived every market downturn, bubble, and chip shortage in the last 60+ years. Meanwhile, you can’t even survive a red day on SPY. Why $VSH is printing money: Chips are everywhere—cars, phones, smart homes, AI servers. The global semiconductor market is growing at an insane pace (projected $1 trillion market by 2030). Guess what? Vishay is supplying the guts. Look at their P/E ratio: 12.5 (as of last check). Compare that to Nvidia’s 75+ or AMD’s 30-ish. $VSH is practically trading at the bargain bin, and yet their revenues are consistently strong. Vishay’s last earnings report crushed expectations, with double-digit growth in several segments. They’re sitting on $3.4B in annual revenue with plans to scale. Oh, and they’re buying back shares like they’re on clearance at Costco. Everyone’s hyped about Nvidia because of AI. Guess what? Vishay supplies components used in AI hardware, EV charging stations, and industrial automation. While Nvidia makes the sexy GPUs, Vishay sells the boring but essential resistors and capacitors that keep those GPUs from melting your motherboard. They’re eating up the market share. Recent Catalysts: Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo dropped a bombshell: Vishay is a key supplier for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI servers (GB200 series, DGX/HGX B200) and the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. These are Nvidia’s future bread-and-butter products, dominating AI and high-end gaming. Vishay replaced Infineon as Nvidia’s MOSFET supplier. Yes, Infineon, the semiconductor giant, just got sidelined. This Is MASSIVE for $VSH. Vishay is providing MOSFET/DrMOS (VRPower), vPolyTan (Polymer Tantalum Capacitors), and Current Shunt Resistors. These components are critical for Nvidia’s most cutting-edge products: • GB200 series AI servers: Nvidia’s next-gen AI infrastructure. • RTX 50 series GPUs: The next flagship graphics cards. Vishay’s vPolyTan capacitors (especially the T55 series) are already facing a supply crunch for 2025. That’s how in-demand they are. Kuo estimates that Vishay’s MOSFET production alone will contribute 20%-30% of revenue by 2025—with above-average gross profit margins. The vPolyTan capacitors will add a high single-digit percentage of revenue with significantly above-average margins. Translation? Vishay is printing money. Vishay’s production lines are already at capacity through 2025. When your biggest challenge is meeting demand, you’re in a good spot. Beyond Nvidia, Vishay is also poised to benefit from: • Automotive rebound: As EV production scales, Vishay’s components are critical. • IoT growth: Billions of devices mean billions of tiny components. Vishay is at the center of it. The Stock Is Still Cheap Even after today’s 7% jump to $18.35, $VSH is wildly undervalued. As I said earlier, the P/E ratio is still around 12-13, compared to Nvidia’s 75+. This is a company with real earnings, real dividends, and real growth potential. This is a great opportunity to make back everything you lost from your MSTR calls. Positions: Shares, 01/17/25 20C",0.5352,POSITIVE,0.9824

"Weekly jobless claims fall to 233,000, less than expected, in a positive sign for labor market.csv","Last night, the U.S. announced that the number of initial unemployment claims for last week was 233,000, significantly lower than the previous week's 249,000 and also below the market's expectation of 240,000! A few days ago, Mr. Wang mentioned that for the U.S. stock market to stop declining, the economic and labor data released must continue to be strong in order to ease concerns about a potential economic recession. Yesterday's sharp drop in initial unemployment claims marked the largest decrease in a year, indicating that the number of people recently unemployed has decreased. This alleviated the recession concerns raised by last Friday's non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate data, spurring a rally in U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 index surging over 2.3%, the largest single-day gain in 21 months 📈. On the other hand, the demand for the 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds at the auctions over the past two days was poor, causing the 10-year yield to exceed 4% once again! Tech giants saw a broad rebound, with Meta rising 4.2%, Alphabet up 1.9%, Amazon gaining 1.8%, Apple increasing 1.6%, and Microsoft rebounding 1%. Nvidia surged over 6%, returning to the $100 mark, leading to a rebound in semiconductor stocks. Broadcom, Micron, and Applied Materials all jumped more than 6%, while Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and AMD all saw gains of over 5%! Taiwan's ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) also rebounded, with TSMC and UMC both jumping more than 6%, and ASE gaining over 4%. However, it's still important to note that the number of continuing unemployment claims is rising, reaching its highest level since November 2021, nearly three years ago! Therefore, Wall Street's foreign investors remain concerned about the economy. For example, JPMorgan still believes the U.S. economy will enter a recession, raising the probability from 25% to 35%!

Why I am going long on Intel and letting Bad Daddy Gelsinger take me to Uranus - DD TurboNerd Post.csv,"TLDR: This stock fucking sucks, and I love it. But the developing foundry business is gonna get absolutely bananas under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for the sole purpose of developing it. They are not gonna let the other chip companies continue to take nut shots on them and they are just gonna make everyone chips for them. Anyways I all in on Mar 2025 Calls (which are like $4.50 - $5.00) right now. Here is some DD. Dog of the Dow Intel has lagged behind other chip titans such as [[AMD - AMD]] and [[NVDA -NVIDIA]] as they race to design and build chips to handle [[AI]] workloads. Both AMD and NVIDA have seen tremendous growth over the past 18 months (as of June 2024). A growth pattern that has gone completely unanswered by INTEL up until this point. Looking at the [[Price to Earnings Ratio]] of both AMD and NVIDIA it is easy to see how disconnected from earnings they have become (though they are both incredibly profitable). AMD P/E Ratio: 67.30 NVIDIA P/E Ratio: 238.53 INTEL P/E Ratio 31.79 AMD is wildly inflated relative to its competition in the space. NVDA is has a more ""sane"" price to earnings but it has also been nearly printing its own money with the amount of sales it has been making. The price of NVIDIA still ""feels"" high despite it's recent split. Another interesting metric to take a look at is the [[Price/Tangible Book]] - Where you take the current price of the stock and compare it to the tangle value of all its assets minus good will. AMD P/TB Ratio: 23.61 NVIDIA P/TB Ratio: 64.73 INTEL P/TB Ratio: 1.75 This says a few things; One either Intel has barely any assets worth liquidating relative to its stock price and the market has priced the stock appropriately, OR the price of the stock is selling for a very reasonable price related to the actual value of the company. This could be considered paying only .75 above book value of the company as a ""premium"" for future expected value. Source: Any trading platform that has data you ding dongs - go look it up. I got these from Schwab jfc. Technical Except for this past Wednesday, this company has been hard stuck around $30 after a selloff from its 52 week high of $51.28. 31.50 appears to be the most reliable resistance level we can work off of right now, then $32.50 after that. If it breaks both of those on a run up, there is literally no ceiling until $46. SO, you tell me what that means. The further you zoom out on your shitty little trading app the more you will see that this period we are in is nothing but consolidation. Foundry Intel's new foundry business will be the corner stone of its future growth. Forget the in house made chips. The company is not-so-silently tyring to be the American version of TSMC. Here is an article they posted on their own site outlining their model. https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-outlines-new-financial-reporting-structure.html#gs.a8z07s Note this section: April 9th 2024 ""Intel Foundry is a newly established operating segment that includes foundry technology development, foundry manufacturing and supply chain, and foundry services (formerly IFS). Under this new structure, Intel Foundry will recognize revenues generated from both external foundry customers and Intel Products..."" Fuck me, if they pull this off under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for this specific function, this stock could easily moon. Not to mention this article detailing that NVIDIA will start using Intels Foundry to start making its own chips. https://www.techspot.com/news/101725-nvidia-turning-intel-foundry-services-expand-gpu-ai.html#:~:text=Nvidia%20could%20also%20choose%20to,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202024. Chips Act ""U.S. Department of Commerce has proposed up to $8.5 billion in direct funding through the CHIPS and Science Act to advance Intel’s commercial semiconductor projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon. Intel also expects to benefit from a U.S. Treasury Department Investment Tax Credit (ITC) of up to 25% on more than $100 billion in qualified investments and eligibility for federal loans up to $11 billion. Proposed funding supports Intel’s previously announced plans to invest more than $100 billion in the U.S. over five years to expand U.S. chipmaking capacity and capabilities critical to economic and national security and acceleration of emerging technologies, such as AI. Intel’s investments are expected to create more than 10,000 company jobs and nearly 20,000 construction jobs, and to support more than 50,000 indirect jobs with suppliers and supporting industries. "" https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/us-chips-act-intel-direct-funding.html#gs.a8z5ze So yea Intel is gonna get paid, and quite a bit. The article states that they are slated to receive up to $8.5 billion, with a B. X86 chips - Speculation With Arm taking dominance over portable computers like laptops, tablets and phones, X86 looks pretty boring. Except you have to remember that both AMD and Intel are still cranking these bad boys out like nobody's business. The raw horsepower in these for desktop workstations and servers is still not matched by ARM and probably wont be for quite a while. Sure they are not quite as power efficient, but who cares in a data center or major compute space anyways. Intel owns almost all of the IP for X86 processors too. AMD has a little bit and they have made improvements and designs of their own that they have been able to patent, but INTEL is the OG maker of these chips. Arm will probably continue to dominate the landscape, but they are the people who license their chips are going to need them made somewhere. They will have like two options. Intel or TSMC. China What happens when CHYNA pulls the trigger and takes over Taiwan. Where is everyone gonna have their chips made? Arizona, that's where. TSMC and Intel are both setting up MASSIVE Fabs there. So, when all the other chip companies get absolutely smoked I expect to see a giant green candle on that morning for INTC. I will probably write more later but this shit got way long way fast.

Why I bought Puts on MNST (Monster).csv,"Since Monster releases its earnings report after market, it’s time for some puts… or calls if you are based and want to inverse me Reason 1: High expectations - Current expectations for this quarterly are quite high.. Expected earnings per share are $0.452 as opposed to the $0.400 of a year ago . In this same light the market expects (has already priced in) a nearly 200 million dollar increase in revenue from the year prior.. Put quite simply these massive increases are already expected and priced in, and it’s much easier to fall short when expectations are this high Reason 2: Competition - PepsiCo is fighting hard for market share of the energy drink market and threw $550 million dollars for an 8.5% share of Celsius in 2022. Monster has already struggled to maintain market share versus Red Bull, which owns the largest portion of the energy drink market.. Now on top of this already stiff competition they have to deal with a whale like PepsiCo flooding the market with products like Rockstar and Celsius over time Reason 3: regulation- As more health focused initiatives take place in Europe and America, products like monster will face increased scrutiny, both from consumers and governments alike (regulations on certain contents). Reason 4: Even those who hit their goals have been getting smashed… AMD and Reddit- Now I get what you are thinking “what the heck do these companies have to do with monster”… and yea they have no direct relationship.. But even after surpassing their goals for this last quarter these companies have seen their value get smashed.. The market is being mad weird and bearish right now when it comes to earnings. So in essence this combined with reason 1 (the high goals they already have), means that I feel that the odds favor the Put/bear side Hope you enjoyed my presentation!!

"Why I think Intel is a Misunderstood, Undervalued Play – A Bet on 18A (+EV DD).csv","Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.",0.5307,NEGATIVE,0.9997
Why Intel is the most undervalued tech stock right now.csv,"Intel ($INTC) is an insane bargain right now, as it is trading at year 1999 stock price.

Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3). Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD & NVIDIA offerings. But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment. Currently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons. Microsoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in.

Since 2021 (before my dad got this cancer shit), I spoke with him and he basically said just look at the fundamentals of a company and invest in growth companies that you think will be around in 5-10 years. I look for value within growth stocks (i know paradoxical). Some of my icons in investing are David Tepper & Michael Burry. Again below is all my own experience and reflects only my own views and are not a recommendation of my company (corporate. disclaimer). My portfolio is heavily weighted (85%) between several stocks: AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL (So fucking cheap r u kidding me sorry), NVDA, AMZN, AMD, CRM, COST, RIVN (RIP), AVGO, VOO (ik not a stock) <-- I know semi(s) are very cyclical but i believe in holding all of these companies for 5-10 years, so I don't have to worry about temp. earnings beats/misses etc. Much easier to pick a stock and hold it for a while then it is to get the timing right. Roughly at 175% return in the past 3 years. (hammered META at $100's, NVDA at $200 both in 2022) Roughly 15% of my bets are moonshots (note the word bet hehe) with promise but objectively could be overvalued/bad investments: CCL/RCL (both are crushing it and between them own 75% of the cruise line market), LCID/RIVN (going to 0 bc they can't scale profitably or will make u a very happy person 3 years down the line bc R2/Atlas at 45k/50k should capture a significant portion of model y demand), TTD, DKNG/FLUT - gambling hasn't even been legalized in Cali/Texas (the biggest markets in the U.S. come on), RBLX (feels like betting against youtube in the early innings w/o realizing how much rev. they're actually recognizing), PYPL (value - cheap af (bought at $60) should turn around in a couple years) I joke I allocate like google's budget where it's 90% bread&butter and the rest are moonshots. Was very depressed (still reasonably depressed) because I'm not sure how much time my dad has. I hope in a way I can pass some of these stocks to my kid in a better place than I found it.

"Advanced Micro Devices to See Continued Share Gains in Notebook, Server Processors, Morgan Stanley.csv","Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is poised for continued share gains in notebook and server processors through 2025, according to Morgan Stanley's analysis of the company's product roadmap. Morgan Stanley anticipates that AMD's core business will ""accelerate meaningfully"" as the PC market continues to recover and server upgrades resume. The investment firm noted that AMD is likely to capture a disproportionate share of these larger projects as upgrades progress. AMD's increased Q3 revenue guidance of about $6.7 billion at the midpoint reflects ""strong momentum across compute businesses,"" according to Morgan Stanley. This momentum underscores the company's effective strategy and execution, positioning it well for sustained growth. Artificial intelligence is also expected to be a significant growth driver for AMD. The company's advancements in AI technology and its strategic roadmap place it in a favorable position to capitalize on the burgeoning AI market. While there are potential delays in the deployment of new AI silicon, the overall outlook remains robust. Morgan Stanley maintains an equal-weight rating on Advanced Micro Devices and has raised its price target to $178 from $176, reflecting confidence in the company's future performance. AMD's strategic positioning and continued execution of its roadmap suggest a promising trajectory. As the PC market recovers and server upgrades accelerate, AMD is well-positioned to capture a significant share of these markets, driving further growth and reinforcing its competitive edge in the industry.",0.5943,POSITIVE,0.9953

AI chipmaker Cerebras files for IPO to take on Nvidia - But 87% of its revenues have come from the U.csv,"The Middle East wants chips badly but US restrictions prevent the US most powerful chips entering into certain geographical areas such as China and the Middle East; this entails the UAE. Nevertheless, the UAE wants in on the GPU chips craze and is apparently willing to pay anything to enter into the chip bonanza. The UAE can't get Nvidia's, AMD's, or Intel's best GPU chips so instead they are investing heavily into alternatives such as Cerebras. There is nothing inherently wrong with this but it's also the biggest red flag as an investment opportunity. If the agreements for Nvidia chips open up in the Middle East and specifically with the UAE that could be a crushing blow to this aspiring startup. Specifically, Cerebras Systems reported a net loss of $66.6 million for the first six months of 2024, on $136.4 million in revenue. For the same period in 2023 it has a net loss of $77.8 million on just $8.7 million in sales. 87% of this revenue for the first half of 2024 was directly from the UAE G42. The other red flag from this startup is the way in which they promote their business. It's all seemingly smoke and mirrors and conveniently based on outdated GPU pricing and throughput information; which is very publically available. For some reason, Groq and Cerebras love to keep using memory to unlock speeds on small/tiny models which is impractical and inefficient for a scaled system; or a system that is a large foundational LLM. As well, they have no clue what models will do next so it's a major after the fact architecture that uses llama because they have access to it. https://cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebras-inference-ai-at-instant-speed. A prime example of this is OpenAI's GPT-o1 model that uses reasoning in coordination with its model capabilities. Because they are not being used on the forefront of this technology they don't know how or when a model's size, function, or needs will evolve into the future. All of this plus the pricing from OpenAI and Microsoft is coming down exponentially. For Example: They are referring to a 70b param model that shoves an entire model onto memory. They are going up against h100's which is a very old technology at this point. They make no reference to h200's let alone blackwell Because they are referencing such a small model the pricing model they suggest would be radically different for a 400b param model and forget about trillion param models which are coming next. They're not being truthful about tokens per s. As of today this is Azure GPT 4o and GPT 4 mini tokens per minute gpt-4o & GPT-4 Turbo global standard Model Tier Quota Limit in tokens per minute (TPM) Requests per minute gpt-4o Enterprise agreement 30 M 180 K gpt-4o-mini Enterprise agreement 50 M 300 As you can clearly see 30 million tokens per minute is 500k tokens per second and mini is 833,333 tokens per second. So i don't know why they are referring to 20 tokens per second or their 450 tokens per second seems way off. maybe they mean million. Even if that is the case and 70 b would be more like mini it is way higher than their limit. On pricing which they lay out a 3:1 input versus output is fine the price would be for mini which is a comparable model is roughly .10 cents (input) + .20 cents = .30 cents. Per million. for regular 4o it would be higher and let's face it GPT 4o is a far superior model than llama 3.1 3.33 dollar + 5 = $8.33 Source: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/ From this information what I can tell you is that what we just went over is pricing. it is not some guarantee for what a model produces per second. That shit is very random. What I can tell you is from GPT 4 to GPT 4 turbo to Gpt 4o the speed is dramatically better. GPT 4o mini is damn near real time. Take that for what it's worth. I am not saying they're being dishonest here but I am saying they are being very cheeky with how they advertise things. The company is currently being primarily supported by the UAE, with investments worth roughly $900 million for new AI supercomputers known as the Condor Galaxy series. Any growth here is singular to this source of investment and not driven by organic growth or usage. This is not a competitor to Nvidia but rather a temporary solution in the Middle East until chip embargoes are alleviated. The media here loves to use sexy headlines on non-technical verifications of what it is they are actually comparing. I.e. H100's are now old, or The fact an entity may need to serve millions of clients... No they are instead reporting self-prompting headlines from Cerebras that say things like our chips are 20x faster than Nvidia. Live Update: As I am writing and researching this topic it has just been reported by Reuters that the U.S. is setting a new rule to allow chip shipments to the Middle East including the UAE which is a boon to Nvidia and Microsoft. US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East Here are couple excerpts: WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), to data centers in the Middle East. G42, a UAE-based AI company with historic ties to China, has been a focus of those concerns. In April, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), opens new tab announced that it would invest $1.5 billion in the company, with plans to provide G42 with chips and model weights, sophisticated data that improves an AI model's ability to emulate human reasoning.The deal drew scrutiny from China hardliners in Congress, even though G42 said in February that it had divested from China and was accepting constraints imposed on it by the United States to work with American companies. LOL you can't make this up. Literally this just got reported by Reuters today 9/30/2024. This completely aligns with my argument above regarding the UAE-G42. With chips now entering into the Middle East from Nvidia and potentially others I don't know how this startup IPO makes it off the ground. I don't mean to be bearish but I don't think this is the time for them to raise an IPO without showing more progress. I could be wrong. As of now, I don't plan on buying any shares. Instead, I will be adding more shares into Nvidia because now this is bullish news for Nvidia.",0.5441,NEGATIVE,1.0

AMD CEO Lisa Su Says AI Is In Early Stages Of Multiyear 'Supercycle' 'There's Tremendous Need For Mo.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) shares are experiencing an upward trend after the company reported strong second-quarter financial results. Following the announcement, CEO Lisa Su emphasized that the chipmaker’s performance is being driven by a multiyear AI “supercycle.” What To Know: Recently, chip stocks saw a sell-off as earnings season approached, with investors questioning the timeline for significant returns on the massive investments in AI. This led to speculation that spending on AI might slow down. However, early earnings reports indicate that capital expenditures have remained robust. Su’s comments on CNBC’s “Squawk On The Street” Wednesday provide reassurance against slowdown concerns. She stated, “From the conversations that I have with our customer set and sort of the broader industry, we can see that AI is a multiyear, you know, I would call it a supercycle frankly. There’s tremendous need for more compute.” AMD reported second-quarter revenue of $5.835 billion and adjusted earnings of 69 cents per share, surpassing analyst estimates as its AI business continues to see accelerating demand. The chipmaker also updated its forecast, expecting GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion this year, up from the previous forecast of more than $4 billion. Su highlighted that analysts and investors are “hypersensitive” to minor quarter-over-quarter changes. She believes that the AI story should be viewed in a broader context, suggesting that the demand is extraordinarily high. “I wouldn’t be hypersensitive in those areas ... Are more customers using it? Is every enterprise asking for it? Are we seeing more applications on a daily, weekly, monthly basis? The answer to that is absolutely yes,” she said. “Everywhere I go, everyone wants to talk about how can we incorporate AI into our businesses faster and more efficiently ... this early in the cycle, there’s a lot of learning and experimentation, but definitely, there will be the return on the investment on the other side,” Su added. Although the return on investment isn’t “instantaneous,” it’s occurring very quickly. AI is already boosting productivity and enabling companies to bring better products to market faster. Su emphasized, “We’re investing today for the return in a couple of years, and I think that’s absolutely the right thing to do. That’s the way to think about these investment cycles.” AMD’s strategic focus on AI and its strong financial performance underscore its robust position in the rapidly evolving technology landscape, highlighting the company’s potential for sustained growth in the coming years.",0.5537,NEGATIVE,0.8673

Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year. This report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure. With Nvidia's earnings report on the horizon, AMD's results offer a useful benchmark. Although AMD has significantly underperformed Nvidia year-to-date, this could be an opportunity to turn the tables. Data Center Growth is Key Analysts predict AMD's data center revenue will reach a record $3.52 billion for Q3. In July, CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in strong revenue growth for the year's second half, driven by demand for Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. Earlier this month, AMD launched its latest data center AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, and investors are keen to see its performance. Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari pointed to sustained growth in AI infrastructure capital expenditure, a recovery in server CPUs, and AMD's ongoing market share gains.

"Apple reportedly seeks to lock out its competitors from TSMC's 2nm process, by booking all of its ma.csv","Apple has long been cozy with TSMC, the manufacturer of the chips that end up in ever-popular iPhone, iPad and Mac products. When you've got as much cash on hand as Apple does, it puts it in a favorable position to negotiate deals with the Taiwan-based chipmaker. Now it is reportedly seeking to lock in 100% of TSMC's bleeding edge 2nm production capacity, giving it a competitive advantage when products eventually make their way to the market. According to 9to5mac (via Extreme tech), Apple's chief operating officer met with TSMC bosses to negotiate terms to secure 2nm capacity. The report cites 'local sources', so there needs to be a pinch of salt here, but given Apple's track record of locking up TSMC's capacity, this would certainly come as no surprise. TSMC's 2nm process is currently scheduled to enter risk production in 2025, with volume production set for the second half of 2025. That means the upcoming iPhone 16 family with A18 chips will stick with 3nm, but it could mean the high end iPhone 17 Pro and Max could be the first in line to be built with 2nm technology. The specifics of deals between TSMC and its customers are obviously not made public, but it is widely accepted that Apple booked all of TSMC's 3nm capacity, at least for a period of time. These chips, including the A17 and M3 families made their way into the latest generation iPhone 15 Pros and MacBooks. That would make Apple's 2nm play unsurprising. It's easy to see why Apple would attempt to secure the maximum amount of 2nm capacity. It will give it an advantage over its competitors, as 2nm chips will allow Apple to pack in more transistors into a given area, leading to better performance or lower power consumption—if not both. Samsung has its own manufacturing capacity, and future Exynos chips will be built in-house, but 2nm Snapdragon and possibly Google Tensor chips may have to wait in line behind Apple. Even mega-companies such as Google and Qualcomm don't have the cash on hand to outbid big daddy Apple. It's not just Arm competitors that will be disadvantaged. Nvidia will want every possible power and performance advantage it can get as it dominates the market for AI processors, while AMD will also have to wait for access to the best nodes. Even Intel could find itself at a disadvantage given some of the tiles for its chips are manufactured by TSMC.

"BEARISH NVDA Development Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Intel developing open standard AI Accelerator .csv","Full Article: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-giants-form-industry-group-120000567.html NVDA's current GPU (AIPU) market domination currently stands at 85-95% of the accelerator market. This is pushing profit margins to extreme levels, protected by a moat defended by CUDA and their consistent R&D in the space, leading to further chip advancements along inference and power efficiencies at a much faster pace than their competitors (AMD/INTEL in particular). This new open standards alliance (UALink Promoter Group) for the interconnect (a.k.a backbone) of server clusters challenges NVDA's own proprietary interconnect systems, but will likely not be able to compete with the new B200 line being delivered in the coming months, due to its extreme efficiencies across GPUs and clusters. However, this new alliance is interesting, and combined with the hyperscalers consistently developing in-house specialized chips for model training and inferences, we will likely see a gradual decrease of market domination over the next 2-5 years. Overall, this seems like a BEARISH development for NVDA",0.5448,POSITIVE,0.9841

Bloomberg Again Reports on Semiconductors With Flimsy Information on Secret Government Contacts.csv,"Usually, when things that are leaked with an intention the entity where the leak comes from is pleased with said leak. Not for Bloomberg though. Bloomberg actually accomplishes citing an anonymous source about on ongoing discussions related to chip distribution and subsequently takes that information to the White House National Security Council to ask them to comment. Here is the WHNSC's response. Bloomberg: US Weighs Capping Exports of AI Chips From Nvidia and AMD to Some Countries A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the talks but pointed to a recent joint statement by the US and UAE on artificial intelligence. In it, the two countries acknowledged the “tremendous potential of AI for good,” as well as the “challenges and risks of this emerging technology and the vital importance of safeguards.” The council responds with a no comment while directing them to a positive statement. To me, this greatly diminishes whomever the Bloomberg contact is. This is the second time that Bloomberg goes out of their way citing a leaky government source that on it's own merits isn't really that sensational at all. The headline is sensational the reality is not. The approach would set a ceiling on export licenses for certain countries in the interest of national security, according to the people, who described the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Officials are focused on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing appetite for AI data centers and the deep pockets to fund them, the people said. This isn't even news. Reuters reported on this a month ago with a much more neutral to positive tone. Which it is. Reuters: US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia to data centers in the Middle East.Since October 2023, U.S. exporters have been required to obtain licenses before shipping advanced chips to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.Under the new rule, data centers will be able to apply for Validated End User status that will allow them to receive chips under a general authorization, rather than requiring their U.S. suppliers to obtain individual licenses to ship to them. If you're tracking, this simply seems to be the 2nd half of that original conversation. There are already chip restrictions. Nvidia is already not delivering the most advanced chips to those countries. The framework proposed would allow Nvidia to deliver chips under certain restrictions and guidelines. Bloomberg acknowledges this towards the tail end of the article. While officials have debated the best approach, they’ve slowed high-volume AI chip license approvals to the Middle East and elsewhere. But there are signs things could get moving soon: Under the new rules for shipments to data centers, US officials will vet and preapprove specific customers based on security commitments from both the companies and their national governments, paving the way for easier licensing down the road. What I don't understand is why does Bloomberg like to make things salacious when they're seemingly not. There is 0 chips to parts of the Middle-East today, but the U.S. government is working on a framework that may relieve that. Reuter story from a month ago. The end. When you read the headline one would believe that they are already selling these chips to the UAE and they're not.",0.5344,NEGATIVE,1.0

For the US and European AI Software Sector the restrictions should be regarded as good news, because with less systems being sold abroad, they won't have to wait that long for their orders.

Could PLTR go on a TSLA-like Run (70%) if Included in SP500.csv,"On June 7th, S&P 500 is set to rebalance and Palantir will be eligible for the third time. With the spotlight on AI and Palantir's continued strong performance, there's a very high likelihood it is included in the S&P, which could lead PLTR going on a Tesla-like run. First, let me break down why Palantir is a great candidate for inclusion. Inclusion in the S&P 500 index involves meeting several stringent criteria related to market capitalization, liquidity, financial viability, and corporate governance. For Palantir Technologies (PLTR) to be considered a good candidate for S&P 500 inclusion, it must satisfy these key requirements: Market Capitalization: A company must have a market cap of at least $14.6 billion (as of 2023). Palantir's market capitalization has been above this threshold for a while. Liquidity: Companies need to have adequate liquidity, with a high trading volume. Palantir's shares are actively traded, reflecting strong investor interest and sufficient liquidity. Financial Viability: The company must report positive earnings in the most recent quarter and over the last four quarters combined. Palantir has demonstrated profitability, reporting positive GAAP EPS in recent quarters (InvestorPlace). U.S. Based: Companies must be U.S.-based, with the majority of their assets and revenues derived from the U.S. Palantir fits this criterion, being headquartered in Denver, Colorado, and deriving significant revenue from U.S. operations. Public Float: At least 50% of a company's shares must be in the public float. Palantir's public float percentage is adequate to meet this requirement, with substantial institutional ownership indicating wide distribution among public shareholders Palantir meets all the eligibility criteria, the only which could be a problem is corporate governance, ie, the insiders own a lot of shares of the company; however there are tons of examples of other companies that have a similar structure. As many of you know, Tesla went on a 70% in the weeks leading up to and the month following its inclusion. However, it's not alone. Many other ""sexy/high-profile"" names go on epic runs when SP500 inclusion is announced. Twitter (TWTR) Inclusion Date: June 7, 2018 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $26 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on May 21, 2018, Twitter's stock increased by approximately 14%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, Twitter's stock increased by about 5%. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2019 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2019, NXP's stock rose by approximately 10%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, NXP's stock increased by around 6%. AMD (Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.) (AMD) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2017 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $20 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2017, AMD's stock increased by approximately 12%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, AMD's stock rose by around 9%. T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS) Inclusion Date: June 22, 2020 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on June 5, 2020, T-Mobile's stock increased by approximately 8%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, T-Mobile's stock saw an increase of about 7%. NVIDIA (NVDA) Inclusion Date: November 18, 2001 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $25 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: NVIDIA's stock saw a significant rise, roughly around 20-25%, in the weeks leading up to the inclusion. Month Following Inclusion: The stock continued to perform well, with an additional increase of around 10-15%. ""S&P 500 effect,"" is a real phenomenon and I think it's even more powerful with high-profile names like Palantir. As mentioned earlier, Tesla went on a god-like run in the weeks leading up to and after the announcement. And I think Palantir shares many characteristics with Tesla that may see it go on a similar run. Both companies have a very high-profile CEO. Alex Karp is loved by Palantir holders just like Elon is by Tesla fanboys, which leads to my most important point: retail ownership. Palantir has a significant amount of its shares outstanding owned by retail; if SP500 inclusion is announced and institutions have to buy shares it may create a similar move like Tesla's as most palantir fanboys won't sell. Like Tesla, they believe Palantir is changing the world (look at their subreddit). I think buying Palantir options is a great upside play with limited downside, depending on when you purchase your options. The inclusion announcement is on Friday after hours, so you could buy Friday before close or anytime this week and sell Monday morning if its not included for a minimum loss. And with options being so cheap, this could be a 50-bagger if it goes to 30 bucks. 6/21 23 C 6/21 25 C.",0.5557,POSITIVE,0.7174

How Terrifying is the Start of August.csv,"Just over the past three trading days, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 indices have all recorded their largest three-day cumulative decline since June 2022! Last night, the Nasdaq plummeted by over 6% at one point, and the S&P 500 dropped by more than 4%, with both indices returning to their early May levels by the close of trading. Although the major U.S. indices and individual stocks still closed with significant losses, the intraday declines were somewhat moderated. The primary reason for this was the release of the U.S. July ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, which rebounded from a four-year low in June to 51.4, exceeding market expectations and returning to the expansion zone above 50! Sub-indices, including the New Orders Index and Employment Index, also showed growth. Notably, the Employment Index reached 51.1, marking the largest increase since September of last year and the first time this year that it has entered the expansion zone above 50. This data slightly alleviated fears from last week's significant non-farm payroll decline, making the market believe that the drop in new jobs was primarily due to Hurricane Barry hitting Texas. 👉 As discussed previously, the sharp decline in U.S. stocks at the start of August stemmed from worries about the U.S. economy falling into recession. Therefore, when the ISM Non-Manufacturing number showed growth yesterday, it somewhat restored market confidence in the economy, helping to narrow the intraday losses of U.S. stocks. The U.S. stock market now needs to see positive economic growth news to recover, unlike before when everyone was hoping for bad news, anticipating a Federal Reserve interest rate cut! Hence, it is crucial to continue monitoring other economic data. If strong and robust growth numbers do not consistently appear, investors will remain concerned about an economic recession, and the trend of selling stocks for cash will not end. The VIX Fear Index is a crucial indicator to observe market sentiment calming down.

I wait all year for this opportunity - now I'm going to share it with you.csv,"If you trade long enough, you begin to see patterns emerge. On October 30th, one of my favorite patterns is starting. If you buy AMD stock on the last Monday of October, the average return for the rest of the year is 24.52%, and the stock is higher 88.89% of the time. This data starts in 2015 because it is the first full year after Dr. Lisa Su became CEO of AMD. Some of you may be wondering why this period is so strong for AMD stock. Let me share my personal theory. AMD depends on TSMC for chip manufacturing. Taiwan is protected by its geography and weather, but the Chinese have two windows of opportunity to cross the Strait with favorable weather. The first is from late March to the end of April. The second is from late September to late October. Last year, China launched major military exercises around Taiwan in April. This year, they did it in October, which just ended a few days ago. (They also launch these exercises when they are provoked, such as when Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan or during the recent Taiwanese elections.) In my view, the end of October triggers a relief rally in stocks related to TSMC, most notably AMD and Nvidia. This combines with earnings and strong seasonality, resulting in massive outperformance in a relatively short period of time. A quick word of warning—this time period includes earnings. If you want to avoid earnings risk, you can wait until the first Monday of November. If you wait until November, the average return is 19.06%, and the stock is higher 77.78% of the time by the end of the year.

Why Intel Could Be the Game-Changer? Intel (INTC) is uniquely positioned to disrupt NVIDIA's monopoly. Alongside AMD, Intel possesses the expertise and resources needed to engineer AI chips. Enter Gaudi 3. If Gaudi 3 lives up to the hype, Intel’s stock could potentially skyrocket, doubling in value in a matter of months hands down. Government Backing: The U.S. government and major institutions are already showing their support for Intel, recognizing its strategic importance in the tech race. Positive Vibes: Reviews for Intel's Arrow Lake architecture are rolling in with strong positives, indicating that Intel's on the right track to regain dominance. Diamond Hands Ready: This isn't just a strategy; it’s a calculated move anticipating a shift in the tech landscape. Intel could lead the next wave of AI innovation.

INTC - A dumb person's retrospective.csv,"I'm lazy and you regards don't like to read so I'll leave it to bullet points and you can piece them together. Intel was seen as a bargain in 2023 compared to NVDA and AMD after their 400% run up. US gov have vested interest in Intel. No they are not propping Intel up, but it's effectively giving Intel a big loan to buy a second house. That loan can pay off if the housing market goes up, or they are double fucked because they leveraged to buy a second house. If you bought Intel because china will invade Taiwan, you are really regarded. If China invades Taiwan, everything is going to sell. That's a disruption of global trade on WW2 levels. Your best case scenario still loses you money. Intel bullish scenario is 18A, High-Na EUV paying dividends, early experience granting them a year technological lead over TSMC. It doesn't have to work, but the upside is a 10x from these levels. TSMC pass up High NA EUV is repeating the same decision Intel did in 2012 when Intel controlled the market and did not view EUV as economically feasible. Again, doesn't mean TSMC is incorrect in their assessment, but history does repeat itself. Intel bearish scenario is just repeat of 2016 and delay after delay. In which case they head to legacy company status like Ford. Anyone else remember all the Ford bulls in 2016? They're not on this sub anymore because they all went broke. I'm no crayon guy.

The investment only somewhat paid off in 2018 when AMD traded to 30, but then half the regards lost everything (myself included) when it crashed to 18 in 2 months following Powell's rate hike. Look how quickly sentiment changed for AMD from 2018. This very well could be history repeating itself, as the semiconductor companies have demonstrated over and over again. Intel 18A is a repeat situation of AMD ZEN. The upside cannot be understated. I'm still bullish. Proper execution can bring the company to a $200+ stock.

Intel - Pinnacle of failure.csv,"Intel's Slippery Slope: Financial Woes, Investor Distrust, and Leadership Issues Intel Corporation, once a dominant force in the tech industry, is now grappling with a series of significant challenges that have fueled a troubling decline. Despite attempts to project a positive outlook, the company’s current trajectory suggests a troubling downward spiral. Financial Performance and Market Challenges Intel's financial performance has continued to deteriorate. For the first half of 2024, Intel reported revenues of $24 billion, marking a slight decrease compared to previous periods. This decline is occurring amid a broader tech sector recovery and highlights Intel’s struggle to maintain its competitive edge. The company's net income for this period was a mere $800 million, translating to a profit margin of approximately 3.3%, indicating substantial operational inefficiencies and intense competition from rivals such as AMD and NVIDIA. Declining Customer Satisfaction and Product Concerns Customer dissatisfaction remains a critical issue. The release of Intel's 14th Gen Core processors has not addressed the performance inconsistencies that plagued previous models. While the company has introduced new features, reviews suggest that these updates have not significantly improved reliability or performance compared to competitors. This ongoing issue is eroding customer trust and impacting market share. Eroding Investor Confidence Investor confidence in Intel is faltering. The recent involvement of Apollo Global Management has raised concerns, particularly following Apollo’s controversial investment decisions in other sectors. Additionally, a recent lawsuit filed by major institutional investors alleges mismanagement and failure to deliver on key performance promises. This legal battle has further shaken confidence, prompting several large investors to divest from Intel, exacerbating the company's financial strain. Leadership and Legal Troubles Intel's leadership is facing intense scrutiny. Recent high-profile exits, including the departure of several senior executives, have led to a perception of instability at the top. The company's reliance on legal strategies to address its challenges, rather than focusing on operational and strategic improvements, appears to be aggravatinh its difficulties. This reactive approach is not addressing the underlying issues affecting Intel’s performance. Future Prospects and Potential Downturn Intel’s future prospects remain uncertain. Despite a significant $15 billion R&D budget, the company’s progress in key areas like AI and autonomous driving lags behind that of its more agile competitors. Moreover, while short-term production issues in Taiwan have provided some temporary relief, these are unlikely to reverse the long-term downward trend. The competitive landscape continues to evolve rapidly, and Intel’s slower adaptation could hinder its recovery prospects. TL;DR Intel’s current strategy, which includes overhauling its product lineup and executive team, appears to be a desperate attempt to stabilize its position. For investors and stakeholders, the warning signs are clear: Intel’s challenges are substantial, and the company’s efforts to turn things around may not be sufficient in the face of ongoing and evolving issues.

Intel is a good buy.csv,"We are all well aware Intel is having it's own Boeing moment right now with design flaws in their CPUs and horrible customer service. They deserve the steaming pile dooky that is currently sitting atop their share value. That being said, they have an ace that may flip the entire market on it's head: They own their fabs. That's right: all the other big boys in town design and give their blueprints for TSMC to manufacture. That's true of AMD, Nvidia, and other ARM and mobile chip designers. Intel is the only large scale chip designers that is more or less vertically integrated. As you may know, they just got $8.8B from papa Biden to build more foundries in Ohio and Arizona, in addition to their other sites across the world. None of this is particularly noteworthy until you consider that China has always been very interested in Chinesing Taiwan, and are even more so now that they have been embargoed from Nvidia chips by the US. The Chinese military build-up over the past decade has focused heavily on amphibious warfare, and long range anti-naval weapons (think carrier buster ballistic/boost-glide stand off weapons.) It doesn't take a Ph.D in geopolitics to understand what the move is here. On the US/allied side, the discourse around Taiwan has slowly shifted: what started out as ""we have overwhelming force and we will stop any attempt at an invasion of Taiwan"" has become something like ""Maybe we can't stop them from invading, but we can make it a Pyrrhic victory"". This may actually be the case, but the trend is not great. You will have noticed Taiwan has been increasingly politically isolated, mirroring the growing Chinese military power in the region. So what happens to TSMC if Taiwan gets Chinesed? As you can imagine, China is interested in acquiring as many TSMC assets and personnel intact as possible. This means you can bet your degenerate bacon that US intelligence services have contingencies to extradite key scientists and engineers, and scuttle the production plants and machines before the Chinese can take control of them. But the result is easy to predict: no more TSMC. This means the personnel extradited will be used to advise and run US production plants owned by, you guessed it: Intel. Intel will have a quasi monopoly on chip manufacturing. The US government see this of course, that's why they are strongly nudging Nvidia to play nice with Intel, because they see a potential future where Intel is the only player in town capable of making Nvidia chips, or any consumer chips at all for that matter, in the West.

Intel is a pretty safe bet and are undervalued.csv,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs. An additional benefit is that Intel can leverage their fabs in order to achieve higher margins for their own products. It's possible Intel's stock could be hit again in a month or so when their report comes out, but they are likely already at bottom.",0.5493,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Is INTC undervalued .csv,"Valuation Analysis of Intel Corporation Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has long been a key player in the semiconductor industry, but recent market developments and the rise of competitors like AMD and Nvidia have caused its stock to significantly underperform relative to its peers. As of Q2 2024, Intel’s total assets amount to approximately $182 billion, with liabilities around $91 billion, resulting in a net asset value of $91 billion. Yet, its market capitalization is around $95 billion, reflecting an almost 1:1 ratio between market cap and net assets. In contrast, competitors such as AMD and Nvidia trade at significantly higher premiums, indicating that the market may be underpricing Intel’s growth potential. Company Market Cap (Billion $) Net Assets (Billion $) Price to Net Asset Ratio Intel 95 91 1.04 AMD 266 56.5 4.71 Nvidia 3,000 58.15 51.58 Understanding Intel’s Valuation The Price to Net Asset Ratio (P/NAV) is a critical measure of how the market values a company relative to its net assets. Intel's current P/NAV of 1.04 reveals that its market value is nearly identical to its net assets, a valuation that appears surprisingly low, particularly when compared to its competitors. AMD and Nvidia, for instance, demonstrate P/NAV ratios of 4.71 and 51.58, respectively. This significant gap highlights the possibility that Intel is undervalued, especially given its strong fundamentals and growth potential. Several factors support this assessment. Despite facing fierce competition, Intel remains a leader in the semiconductor industry, known for its quality and innovation. The company is making substantial investments in new technologies and manufacturing capabilities, positioning itself to capitalize on growing trends such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, Intel boasts a robust balance sheet, with total assets of about $182 billion and liabilities around $91 billion. This financial strength provides a solid foundation for future growth and strategic initiatives. Although the recent decision to lay off 15,000 employees might seem concerning, it is part of a broader strategy to enhance operational efficiency and focus on core competencies, enabling Intel to adapt more effectively to evolving market demands. A key factor influencing Intel's future is the increasing global demand for semiconductors. As technology becomes more integrated into daily life, the need for high-performance chips continues to rise. Intel's resources and commitment to innovation position it to capture a larger share of this expanding market. Moreover, government support for the semiconductor industry adds another layer of potential upside for Intel. Given the strategic importance of semiconductor manufacturing in light of global supply chain challenges, particularly concerning the Taiwan-China situation, there is growing interest from government entities to bolster domestic semiconductor production. This focus on strengthening local supply chains can create favorable conditions for Intel, as it could receive both financial incentives and regulatory support to expand its operations and enhance its competitive positioning. Conclusion In summary, Intel Corporation is significantly undervalued based on its current P/NAV ratio. The company possesses strong assets, a history of innovation, and a strategic focus on future technologies. As Intel continues to execute its strategic plans and navigate market challenges, it has substantial potential to regain its competitive edge and achieve remarkable growth. Furthermore, the increasing government interest in supporting semiconductor manufacturing amid geopolitical uncertainties enhances Intel's prospects. The market's current valuation does not adequately reflect Intel's true value and growth potential, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

Long-time AMD Holder (Cost Basis 1904) Starting to Sell - Anyone Else Disappointed in the Stock in 2.csv,"Wrote about my thinking below... Out of the 31 large banks, 25 have a “buy” rating and 6 have a “hold” rating on AMD 0.29%↑. It’s hard to think about why to sell when everyone is telling you to buy, but I am of the opinion that is when it should be most deeply considered. image credit to tipranks.com AMD has been my most profitable investment of the past 5 years, having risen 800% since purchased in August of 2018. For most investors (including myself), it’s difficult to part with winners. Not only that, I am someone who believes AI will proliferate throughout society in the coming years. Because they design data center GPUs, AMD should be one of the primary beneficiaries as the AI boom continues. It might seem counter-intuitive then to sell the stock here, but that is what I’ve begun doing over the past two weeks. I had high hopes for AMD this year, but it’s my view that they've failed to take significant data center GPU market share from Nvidia, and will have increased competition from Intel's new product offerings (on both client and data center), as well as proprietary silicon from large cloud players (Google, Amazon, etc). My original thesis was that AMD would profit from overextended Nvidia margins in 2024, but this underestimated the CUDA ecosystem moat that existed with Nvidia data center products (see Why I Got Nvidia Wrong). While most large cloud players want to diversify at least somewhat from Nvidia, they are still unable to do so without risking a competitive advantage with their own AI offerings. Add Intel into the mix, and the margin and market share pressure will be on AMD. The only player in the silicon value chain I think which can currently raise margins is TSMC (TSM 2.61%↑), but the geopolitical risk is too high for me to continue holding the stock (I sold my TSMC stake two weeks ago). On the PC (personal computer), Nvidia has always had a strong moat. It’s not just because they have the best performing products, but also because game developers are economically incentivized to optimize first (and often only) for the largest potential audience. This is similar to the moat CUDA protects on the data center side. One might think that Nvidia charging incredibly high prices for discrete graphics cards would cause them to lose share to AMD with consumers who directly purchase the products (as opposed to businesses who purchase the data center products). Yet Nvidia market share has only grown over the past few years. Data from Jon Peddie Research Why This Take Could Be Wrong: There is a lot of bullish momentum in the investor community around AMD currently from both professional commentators and retail investors (e.g. Twitter / X). Many people who had never heard of AMD 5 years ago are now saying to put money into the stock as it is Nvidia’s only pure AI competitor. As a result of this, AMD could see a dramatic rise on a positive earnings report later this month. In addition, I expect gaming revenues to surprise to the upside with the minor refresh of Xbox and Playstation consoles coming for holiday season. I still have ~260 shares of AMD remaining, and will likely hold to see if the stock jumps on the report. I think that AMD is extremely stretched in its current valuation (P/E of 205), and that any bad news could send it spiralling. Selling half of the remaining stake now is essentially a hedge against this possibility. Whatever happens with the earnings report, I will likely reduce my AMD holdings to zero in the next few months as I continue to lower exposure to companies reliant on Taiwan.",0.5591,NEGATIVE,0.9976

Wells Fargo ($WFC) must face a lawsuit over sham job interviews Rate Cut Countdown — Will the Fed Finally Pull the Trigger? Nope, the Fed isn’t cutting rates this week. But don’t snooze just yet—this meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn’t overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy—he's searching for that ""just right"" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same. Inflation: Cooling Off Inflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year’s 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the ""last mile"" of inflation reduction. The message? We’re on the right track, folks. Unemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it’s taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell’s recent take? The labor market isn’t adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a “sweet spot”—balancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals. Risk Management Reboot With inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed’s risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle—slightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed’s past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they’re determined to act promptly to avoid a recession. Some Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it’s time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn’t seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first. The Fed’s balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31. McDonald’s: The Golden Arches Stumble By the Numbers Revenue: $6.49 billion (missed $6.61 billion estimate) Earnings per Share: $2.97 (missed $3.07 estimate) Same-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020) U.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7% International Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1% International Franchised Sales: Down 1.3% McDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening. Value Meals to the Rescue The fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn’t translated into higher overall sales just yet. Internationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk. Defying the Odds Announcing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away. Despite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a ""buy"" and none recommending a sell. Looking Forward The golden arches are taking a ""forensic approach"" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales. So, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future. On The Horizon Tomorrow Economic Data and Earnings This week is buzzing with key economic data, especially on the employment front. Tomorrow, we'll get the June JOLTS report, which stands for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. This report measures job openings, hirings, and separations (like firings and retirements), offering a detailed snapshot of the U.S. job market. The May report surprised everyone with an unexpected increase in job openings, suggesting a stronger labor market. This might just be the signal the Fed needs to consider rate cuts sooner than expected. Earnings season is heating up, and the first of the Magnificent Seven stocks reports tomorrow after the close.

However, Corning’s traditionally steady growth might not match these high expectations. If management doesn’t deliver impressive forecasts, a selloff could be on the horizon. Analysts are expecting $0.46 EPS and $3.54 billion in revenue. Paypal ($PYPL) faced a setback when Apple introduced a competing payment service in June. Nonetheless, PayPal remains robust, thanks to its strong e-commerce presence, Venmo's popularity, and its new checkout system, Fastlane. Optimistic shareholders are hoping for an earnings beat.

Microsoft’s Cloud Rain on Earnings Parade In a classic case of “so close, yet so far,” Microsoft ($MSFT) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, only to see its stock plummet over 5.79% in after-hours trading. Why? Investors fixated on the company’s disappointing Azure cloud revenue. Earnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints Microsoft’s revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure’s performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue—just shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub’s impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn’t enough to quell investor concerns. By the Numbers Revenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected Market Reaction and Future Outlook While the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft’s other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure’s growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn’t enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft’s shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500’s 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market’s laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters. Chips Ahoy! AMD’s Data Center Sales Surge 115% AMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let’s break it down. Earnings Breakdown AMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street’s expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter AI Chips and Data Center Dominance The tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company’s overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast. Other Segments and Market Reaction While the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD’s business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year AMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high. On The Horizon Tomorrow’s labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let’s be honest, they’re all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week’s job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes. Before Market Open Boeing ($BA): Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels. Expected: $3.51 EPS, $6.85 billion in revenue. Marriott International ($MAR) : The hospitality giant thrived post-pandemic with revenge spending, but the travel boom is slowing.

After Market Close Meta Platforms ($META): Next up in the Mag 7 parade, Meta’s spending spree on AI, including the new Llama 3.1 model, is under the microscope. The focus will be on how these investments impact cash flow and margins. Expected: $4.72 EPS, $38.30 billion in revenue. Arm Holdings ($ARM): With a staggering 94% rise in 2024, Arm’s valuation is in question. Shareholders are keen to see continued strong demand for semiconductors without sacrificing margins.

My Analysis on ARM Holdings 2 Trillion+ Valuation.csv,"I believe ARM Holdings is slept on! I believe it could be the next NVIDIA. As of this writing its Market Cap is sitting at $142.36 Billion. I believe that its market cap should be ATLEAST 1 trillion due to the fact that it has an enormous market share of damn near if not more of 95% of the worlds smart device chips. What makes ARM unique is its business model. Their primary source of revenue is from the leasing of the design of the instruction set of computer chips. For those who dont know the instruction set is often referred to as an instruction set architecture (ISA), is a group of commands for a CPU in machine language. These commands tell the processor what operations to perform. Each instruction in the set specifies a particular operation to be performed on a specified set of data operands. The instruction set is fundamental to the design and functionality of computer chips, dictating how software communicates with hardware... So what is unique about this? Well I will tell you, these instruction sets are incredibly energy effecient compared to what is used currently for AI such as RISC or X86 etc. Currently NVIDIA is soaring because of the AI craze and its success has put light onto AMD, INTEL, SMCI etc but I believe ARM is a sleeper in my opinion. Their main source on revenue is through the royalties it recieves for leasing its designs. They can easily raise the royalty rate to increase their revenue stream anytime but there are some downsides. There customers could leave them and use other options. I dont think that is going to happen because lets face it their intellectual property is far better than any of the competition in terms of effeciency. AI is growing rapidly and one key expense is going to be energy consumption. Especially in these data centers. To my knowledge most data centers run on chips that use x86 from Intel. Those chips using that instruction set uses alot of energy. I believe data centers are looking to convert to a more energy effecient chip and when they do.... ENTER: ARM. Arm is currently used in almost all smart devices because again they are energy effecient. Why do we have longer battery life in a smart phones? Its because of ARM. What chips do electric cars use? ARM what instruction set does your microwave, fridge, washing machine use? ARM. Currently ARM is all over the portable device market but once they hit the data centers I believe there revenue is going to explode and therefore the market cap. There are major catalysts going down right now such as Microsoft partnering with them to make ARM based laptops and NVIDIA collaborating with them to make computers, not to mention that Tesla ordered a ton of NVIDIA chips that use ARM architecture. But my most bullish thing about ARM is what Jensen Huang said at Computex. He said that AI will eventually become physical in terms of robotics. Do you think those robotics need a energy sucker of a computerchip instruction set? No, the need the most energy effecient tech in todays age and that where ARM steps up right again. Currently we only use AI remotely (Chat GPT, Picture Generators, Etc.) but once we put AI into something physical and tangible such as robots to do everyday tasks those devices and robots need to run on the most advance and effecient software. I am currently looking at an outlook of 5-15 years and I am long on my position is this stock. We all seen what nvidia did and can only imagine what the next stock can yield the same returns and I think its ARM Holdings. Imagine going back to 2017 and investing into NVIDIA when the markect cap was the same as ARM now. Those returns look nice right if you have invested then. The time is now. Please keep in mind that i have not decided to go completely in depth of all of my research on ARM Holdings so please do your own. Also, I purposefully did not go into fundementals such as earnings and revenue on this. This is just my personal long term outlook on the research I have done. There are plenty more catalysts and risks out there so please DYOR. Feel free to comment!",0.5404,POSITIVE,0.9991

My outlook on markets going forward - from a dear regard.csv,"January 2024: market starts to price in anticipated 4-5 rate cuts in 2024. Tech moons. Small/Mid caps stagnant. for the first quarter you could make bank - i made 30k through march and withdrew that shit to pay for my kids school. April 2024: I am now a reformed bear continuing bull strategy from the first 6 weeks: S*P drop 5.4% through April 19 - higher than expected inflation date. Push rates higher, lower # of anticipated rate cuts. I got hammered trying the same call strategy. Gave away 15k if not more. May 2024: AI AI AI every time you say AI in your earnings call the price goes up $1. S&P up 5.96% June 2024: News Report: tech doesn't even need a rate cut to continue the bull run. June 12 $AAPL says ""APPLE INTELLIGENCE"", reaches all time highs. (puts for their earnings btw). $NVDA 140% for the year? After last year we were like WTF how is this 300 a share let alone 1400 a share in June. July 2024 $GOOG $AMZN up ~80-100% for the year. Look, its logical to take profits. No shame in that especially for retail who loses out 90% of the time. July 2024: Rate cuts like 99.999% almost certain for sept. Now suddenly Small/Mid caps rally in a massive sector rotation. $SPX/$NDX tanks. Next week: 1T outflows. Then they pump and dump the russel up 12% to 2022 highs and then sell off for a quick 6% while everyones FOMOing into $RUT. Maybe more like RUT RO!!!! I Fomo'd last of dry powder MOnday but after earnings I'm turning bearish. Tomorrow 5k realized loss for me or hold to 0. Too hard to beat the street. Profit taking, buying million dollar real estate with cash like smart investors do. Sit on the sidelines and let it bleed. But here we are still FOMO'ing calls and short dated puts that would only print 1/1000 times. Over the past few days 3 mag 7 earnings all tanked and here we are. AMD? CPUs Good for gamers and graphics cards for poors. Pennies compared to $NVDA. $NVDA has a monopoly on AI software like $ASML has a monopoly on lithography and $TSM has a monopoly on chip production. $TSLA obviously seemingly doomed. Google can't take your cookies anymore, advertising revenue down MoM. Wanna get cucked by the zuck? I'm tempted to donate $1 to people wanting to buy $META calls at this point. TLDR: This looks like the same pattern we have had in 2022 and 2023 when markets take a downturn through mid-late October. Look at the previous years.

My thesis on INTC going into 2025.csv,"I am going to add my technological and geopolitical fundamentals here, because I think these are going to be important factors heading into 2025. Disclaimer: I own 575 shares of Intel at an average PpS of $29.30 I think most analysts are forgetting that the next president is the same guy who is trying to block the acquisition of US steel by Nippon steel at all costs, regardless if it makes financial sense or not because he wants to retain as much American Manufacturing as possible and wants it to succeed. Most of the ""AI revolution"" has happened over the past 4 years where the administration had no problem letting foreign chip manufacturing take the lead. Intel is competing with TSMC, and TSMC receives massive subsidies and discounts from the Taiwanese government which dwarf the 7.9B (which was even reduced) from the US government. On top of that, the US government is also giving slightly less in subsidies, 6.6B, to TSMC to build in the US. So really, the current administration is not giving Intel an advantage over TSMC. The most effective thing that they could do is levy tariffs against Taiwan, which the next president has gone on record stating he wishes to do, instead of subsidies. This would increase demand for American chip manufacturing; while TSMC can manufacture in the US, CoWoS packaging is done outside of the US, in either Malaysia or Taiwan, and would cause the product to be subject to tariffs. In the chip design space, Intel is hopelessly behind on GPUs compared to Nvidia, and now Apple, Amazon, OpenAI and others are designing their own chips and using TSMC for manufacture. Intel still dominates the CPU space, but your average datacenter rack might have 10/20+ GPUs for each CPU. AMD is also a viable alternative to Intel for CPUs, and as such takes about 25% of the market. Intel's only way to compete in the GPU space is in the cost performance market, which mainly targets budget gaming, crypto mining, and cheap datacenter. The newest release of the ""Battlemage"" B580 is expected to compete with Nvidia's 4060 at the under $300 MSRP market, which are lofty goals. Nvidia and AMD still have offerings in these spaces but they are not lucrative ones. So Intel is basically competing to be a 3rd rate designer in the US, while they still have the CPU lead it matters a lot less for the lucrative markets right now. It's clear that on the design front, Intel is not going to receive much help to be successful. While this is their core business and majority of revenue, it is a business they are falling behind substantially compared to others. Design demand is GPUs and they are late to this party. Revenue for products is expected to stagnate or decline unless they have a competitive GPU offering. However, the US needs to have a domestic cutting edge chip manufacturing supply chain. It has expressed as much as a result of the 2022 supply chain shortage when we realized that letting TSMC manufacture 90% of the world's sub 5nm chips was a bad idea. That was the motivation behind passing the CHIPS act; Pat Gelsinger was instrumental in advising the current administration for this. The method for doing so has left a lot to be desired; Pat himself even expressed as much given the delay in fund disbursement, which in all fairness was only accelerated as a result of the election result and comments from republicans that they wanted to repeal the act. TSMC is not allowed to have the latest node fabricated in the US by law of the Taiwanese government. This is so that the country keeps its ""Silicon Shield"", the dependence globally to have manufacturing be done there which keeps Taiwan protected from China. But Intel has no such limitation. And TSMC is not able to fufill 100% of the orders for its customers; it is aggressively building more fabs to keep up with the ever increasing demand of AI. This demand exists for Intel to take part of. So, Intel in the next administration will have a tremendous amount of support for its Foundry, not Products, side of the business. This leaves Intel with a potential alternative to many of the scenarios analysts predict: It could solely dedicate to Foundry and sell off its Products division, most likely to AMD which shares the x86 architecture already and is solely focused on design. This would allow Intel to become a Foundry for external customers without having a conflict of interest, which I suspect is keeping them from customers. The CHIPS act stipulates that Intel has to retain a majority stake of Foundry but NOT Products, so this does not prevent Intel from dedicating itself to Foundry, which is what the US wants. I think Pat was waiting for the right climate to do this and it is coming soon. It is sad he did not stay long enough to see it happen. If Intel received the same amount of support from the US government that the Taiwanese government gave to TSMC, and was able to win external customers as a result of Tariffs, it could become the US TSMC. Much of this hinges on the 18A and later 14A nodes which are competitive with TSMC 2nm, which is the current cutting edge. But I think this is the desire of Intel and the next administration, and so they will work towards this goal. To diminish foundry would be a slow death for Intel. That is why I am still looking forward to Intel in 2025. If you got this far, thank you for reading. EDIT: Now that I think about it, it is also entirely possible for Qualcomm to buy Intel's Products division. I think they expressed as much earlier this year, but being they are primarily ARM I am not sure if it would be a good fit.",0.5359,NEGATIVE,0.9956
My views on why NVDA beats earnings and flies to higher supports Likley past 200.csv,"For the PE bitchers and moaners, I leave you this: AMD Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 126 NVDA Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 69 Chanos bitched and moaned all the way to the broke house where he had to close shop.

Market is expecting a healthy stable growth, now that we are near equilibrium with AI and chips, ( this is obviously not true, but it's the arguments bears try to hang on. They think Amazon will overtake a 30 year CUDA industry software environment the entire world/industry has created THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AROUND). Go look up CUDA. It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four...

NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming Latest Sept 2025, with my guess, Jensen starts marketing from first half of 2025, and wider release commercially of NVDA CPU for 1st qtr of 2026, March, me thinks Jensen starts getting market ready all of 2025 for release in the wild September 2025 for retail user and full wider release by March 2026 / end of February 2026. Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?.. I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about.

Nearly every other chip designer abandoned fabs because businesses operate best when they focus on what they do best. Intel is unique in that it is set up to transform the business into a major foundry model going forward. That takes decades of investment which Intel is ahead on.

NVDA has been all the rage and justifiably so.csv,"Since NVDA reporter its Q1 2023 earnings, revealing huge demand for AI chips, the stock has surged to $3.3T. Revenues 4x, margins up expanded and everything seemed perfect. Bulls claimed the stock was getting cheaper to decelerating growth. Quarterly revenue growth has dropped from 88% to 34% to 18%, heading towards single digits. Next quarter we’ll see just 7%. All of the marginal buyers are in — sucking the last few retail buyers in with the lure of a split. History suggests short term bump after a split as we are seeing, but now institutional investors have a vast pool to distribute their shares in coming months. As the saying goes, “when the ducks are quacking, feed them.” If the quarterly revenue growth continues to moderate, earnings growth will be impacted as well — making the stock become more and more “expensive” (multiple screams higher) versus the theme of last year when the higher it climbed the “cheaper” it got. This does not change the fact that it is a great business with a great leader — which will play a role in the advance of AI technologies and productivity. It’s just going to be a heavy lift that it retains a perception of greater value than Amazon, Microsoft or the entire German Stock Market Capitalizations (where it trades now). NVDA is still a semiconductor company, which has never been a secular business — it’s cyclical. Always has been, always will be. As for 70% gross margins, as Bezos famously said, “your margin is my opportunity.” NVDA has not cured cancer. There will be more and more competition going forward. Intel’s Gaudi 3 is 50% faster than NVDA’s H100 and 40% more energy efficient. AMD is gunning for them.

We'll be bringing that late next year when Falcon Shores, when we combine the great systolic performance of Gaudi 3 with a fully programmable architecture and all of that comes together with Falcon Shores. And then we have a rich, a very aggressive cadence of Falcon Shores products following that. We also added the Gaudi 3 PC IE card to it, this use case of Xeon plus an accelerator or Gaudi accelerator is getting very good response from customers as well. So we'll be bringing that out later this year. But the real story is delivering the TCO value, delivering the enterprise use cases. On Falcon Shores, we'll just build on the momentum that we're establishing with Gaudi 2 and 3.

"NVDA will hit 5T market cap in 2026, and 10T market cap before 2032.csv","Hi regards, This is not a ""copium"" post about the recent stock price drops. I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest. The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY. First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"". Name Stock price EPS SP/EPS ratio AAPL 230 1,4 164 MSFT 413 2,95 140 AMD 145 0,16 1.035 META 516 5,16 100 AMZN 171 1,26 135 NVDA 116 0,68 170 As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price. But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list. AAPL Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits. How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new. But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more. MSFT They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are. They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy. They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office? AMD I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first. Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware. Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software. And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section. META They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value. ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS. AMZN The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL. NVDA AND OUR STAR CHILD. HOT TOPIC OF 2024. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company. Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?

You can't have this kind of transformation without people getting overexcited for a few years. But we aren't at that stage yet. Look at how long the dotcom bubble took, and more importantly, look how the late stage was characterized - explosion of IPOs. Until we get a flood of IPOs, we aren't in the late stage. Until we see an IPO for SexRobots Inc, we aren't in the late stage. At the moment we've got a handful of companies beating expectations because of AI revenue (good for Nvidia, long-term), and some beating CapEx expectations because of AI spending (good for Nvidia, short-term) The current situation Look at Nvidia P/E compared to its share price. We're halfway through the year. At the end of this fiscal year, Nvidia will be worth $180 at the midline of this trend. It is currently $113. That is a 57% return, 157% on an annualized basis. Nvidia is down 17% from its peak. Its hard to call the bottom, but yesterday we saw a major flash crash followed by a v back up. Much like the opposite of the ""blow-off"" tops that we see when the bull runs peak. Big volume selling, big volume buying. Big down, big up. I expect the fast bears used that to get out. The slow ones will watch their profits start eroding before also bailing and taking their gains. The slower ones will hit their stop losses, and the slowest will drift back into the red. If you're a bear in the green, take the W and get out Upcoming catalysts Other company earnings next week - MSFT, META, SNAP, AMD, ARM Upcoming earnings What are the market expectations for next earnings? They say they are expecting $0.59 per share. But last quarter Nvidia made that, on the back of 26B in revenue. For this quarter, Nvidia predicted 28B revenue.

NVIDIA (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang Points to 1 Trillion Opportunity for the Company.csv,"Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the next few weeks until the US election would be “confusing” for many since no one could say anything with conviction about who is going to be in the White House. Lee said that the market is going to trade “well” into the upcoming Fed meeting where he expects “some” rate cuts amid the labor market needing support and positive inflation data. Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said: However, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive. For this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that a trillion dollars’ worth of general-purpose data centers will inevitably transition to accelerated computing. “We’re in a computer revolution,” Huang said, pointing out that the first wave of data center modernization is driven by generative AI, which he described as more than just a tool—it’s a skill. Huang also emphasized the need for “densification,” with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) aiming to make data centers more efficient by compressing them into smaller spaces. He discussed NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it. Nvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia. Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave. At Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range. Of course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.

Nvidia The only problem you're gonna have is that you didn't sell more.csv,"Introduction Alright, so Nvidia is crazy overvalued right now. Just check out its P/E ratio – it's sitting at a whopping 73.94. And that's not all. Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.55, and the price-to-sales ratio is over 42. These numbers are way above what you typically see for tech stocks and the semiconductor industry. There are two big reasons why Nvidia's stock might take a hit: growing competition and lowered margins. Growing Competition First off, the competition is heating up big time. 🔥 AMD's MI300 series is a beast, merging CPU and GPU on the same chip, which is great for performance and energy efficiency. This is super important for data centers and AI applications, and it could seriously cut into Nvidia's market share. AMD is coming in hot, and Nvidia might end up feeling the burn. Then you've got Intel with their Gaudi3 GPU, which is packing some serious performance and efficiency for AI and machine learning tasks. More people might start switching to Intel's GPUs, giving Nvidia a run for its money. Intel's Gaudi3 could be the ghost in Nvidia's machine👻 Lowered Margins Then there's Amazon, which is throwing its hat into the ring with custom GPUs for their EC2 instances. These GPUs are optimized for machine learning and AI, and they integrate perfectly with Amazon's cloud services. This seamless integration could mean less reliance on Nvidia's products, pushing Nvidia to cut prices to stay competitive. Lower prices mean lower margins, which isn't great for Nvidia's bottom line. Amazon could very well turn Nvidia's margins into margin call memes. 📉 Adding to the heat, TSMC is thinking about jacking up production fees for Nvidia. The chairman's plans to raise prices could eat away at Nvidia's margins even more. If TSMC hikes those fees, Nvidia might have to dig deeper into their pockets, and that could be a real pain in the margins. 💸 Link (06/04) So yeah, Nvidia's stock might be flying high right now, but with all this competition and pressure on margins, it might not stay that way for long. It's looking like Nvidia might be headed from tendies to tears if they can't keep up. 😂 TL;DR Nvidia is trading high, but AMD, Intel, and Amazon are bringing the heat. 🔥 Competition + TSMC price hikes = potential margin squeeze. Stock might go from 🚀 to 💥 if they don't keep up. 😂",0.5456,NEGATIVE,0.9812
Nvidia's Blackwell Delay Offers Investors A Chance To 'Add To Positions' says Goldman Sachs.csv,"Nvidia Corp (NVDA) finds itself at the center of tech speculation as reports have surfaced about potential delays in its much-anticipated Blackwell architecture. With tech giants like Nvidia often facing the heat of public and market scrutiny, the slightest hiccup can stir investor unease. But is this delay really a cause for concern, or just a blip on Nvidia’s otherwise smooth journey towards AI supremacy? According to a report by The Information, Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell chips might hit a speed bump, delaying their release by over three months due to alleged design flaws. These chips were set to ship later this year, boasting promises of up to 30x better Inference performance over their predecessors. Despite this setback, Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs advises investors to remain calm and continue with their current strategies. The delay, while not ideal, is unlikely to impact Nvidia's 2025 earnings power or its market dominance, according to Hari. “We expect there to be little to no impact on CY2025 earnings and, most importantly, the company's long-term competitive position.” Hari believes that any short-term volatility in Nvidia's fundamentals will be just that—short-lived. The Market Reaction: Opportunity or Overreaction? For those ready to jump ship, Hari's advice is clear: stay the course. Nvidia's stock might experience some turbulence, but the company’s strong footing in the AI market isn't going anywhere. “We would consider any near-term dislocation in the stock as an opportunity to add to positions.” Despite a recent 15% correction, Nvidia remains a top pick, firmly seated on Goldman's Americas Conviction List with a 12-month price target of $135, suggesting a potential upside of nearly 26%. Even with Blackwell’s reported delays, Nvidia’s projected 39% year-over-year growth in 2025 remains unchanged. Hari’s bullish stance is rooted in Nvidia’s role as a crucial player in the rapidly evolving AI sector, especially as the demand for advanced AI infrastructure shows no signs of slowing down. Implications for Rival – AMD Interestingly, while the Blackwell delays might appear as a dark cloud over Nvidia, there could be a silver lining for competitors like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (AMD). “We believe the market could perceive this development as a marginal positive for AMD — the only alternative to Nvidia today in Data Center GPUs.” Although the analysts say AMD is unlikely to overtake Nvidia due to Nvidia’s strong market position and AMD’s challenges in scaling operations, this situation could still present a competitive boost for AMD. What’s Next for Nvidia? In the tech world, where speed and innovation reign supreme, a three-month delay might seem significant. However, Nvidia’s legacy of innovation and market leadership paints a different picture. As Hari points out, “any impact to CY2025 earnings will be negligible,” and the temporary setback should not deter investors from seeing Nvidia’s long-term value. For now, Nvidia’s strategy remains rock solid. The potential delay, whether factual or exaggerated, is but a temporary hurdle, according to Hari. As Nvidia navigates this challenge, the market watches closely, with many investors seeing a buying opportunity amid the noise. For those invested in Nvidia's future, Hari’s message is clear: hold steady, as the AI revolution waits for no one.",0.5505,NEGATIVE,0.9994
NVIDIA's share price surge and the outlook for the AI arithmetic market bubble risk and rational lay.csv,"As NVIDIA's share price has risen sharply in the short term, many have begun to wonder if the industry is facing a turning point or if there is a bubble. From the perspective of the industry giants, GPUs, as representatives of A1 arithmetic chips, are currently far from meeting demand. We can assume that AI applications are still only in their infancy, and there has not yet been a particularly prominent Al burst application in the world. Analyse the results: The AI market is still at an early stage: AI applications, despite explosive growth in recent years, are still at an early stage. The arithmetic power required for current AI applications (e.g., big language modelling, autonomous driving, robotics, etc.), especially GPUs, is still in the pre-burst stage. The growth of Tesla and the robotics industry, for example, predicts that billions of robots will be needed in the future for arithmetic support. This means that there is a huge potential for growth in AI arithmetic demand over the next few years, especially in inferential computing. GPUs as core hardware for AI: GPUs play a key role in AI inference computing, especially in tasks that require high parallel processing power (e.g., deep learning inference, autonomous driving, robot control, etc.). Although there are already many GPU products on the market, overall, the demand for AI computing power is still in a state of oversupply, and the size of the AI computing power market is likely to continue to expand, especially in the ‘reasoning’ segment of the demand for this segment is the area of high computation, especially in the field of automated driving, cloud computing and so on. Personal view: NVIDIA's leadership in the GPU space is well recognised, but many are beginning to worry about an industry bubble due to the short-term surge in its share price. NVIDIA's dominant position: Currently, NVIDIA is the almost unrivalled leader in the field of AI hardware (especially GPUs), and its products are widely used in AI training and reasoning calculations, especially playing a central role in large-scale data centres and cloud services. NVIDIA's rising share price reflects investors' optimistic expectations about the potential of the AI market. Bubble Risk: As NVIDIA's share price has surged, the market has become sceptical about whether it is overvalued. NVIDIA's high valuation could lead to the formation of a bubble, especially if its products and technologies are not sufficiently digested by the market. While the AI industry is promising, the market is volatile in the short term and the rise of competitors (e.g. AMD) could change the market landscape. Therefore, investors and industry observers need to be wary of market overheating and short-term speculation. Core view: US tech giants (e.g. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook) are supportive of NVIDIA's technology, but they will also support NVIDIA's competitors, such as AMD, in order to avoid the arithmetic market being monopolised by one company and to ensure the sustainable development of the industry. Analyse the results: Rational rather than short-term profit-driven: the behaviour of these tech giants suggests that they are not simply pursuing short-term profit when purchasing AI arithmetic, but are planning the security and sustainability of their own development in the long term. By supporting competitors such as AMD, these companies avoid the risk of the market becoming too dependent on NVIDIA alone, ensuring diversity in market competition and technological innovation. This kind of rational decision-making is crucial to the healthy development of the AI hardware market. If NVIDIA dominates the AI arithmetic market without competitive pressure, it could lead to overpricing, affecting the interests of other tech giants. As a result, companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon prefer to ensure diversity and healthy competition in the AI arithmetic market by supporting competitors such as AMD. In summary: future outlook and risks Huge potential for AI arithmetic: The demand for AI arithmetic is far from reaching its ceiling, especially in the area of inferential computing, and the market demand for GPUs will continue to grow as robotics and autonomous driving technologies evolve. The adoption of AI technologies will generate even more demand for arithmetic power in the coming decades, especially in emerging technologies such as robotics and autonomous driving. NVIDIA's dominance and risks: While NVIDIA's dominance in the AI hardware space cannot be ignored, the sharp rise in its share price and high market valuation have raised concerns about the existence of a bubble. Future technological competition, especially the rise of competitors such as AMD, may affect NVIDIA's market share. Long-term layout of industry giants: U.S. tech giants are very rational when investing in AI arithmetic, they will not simply pursue short-term benefits, but pay more attention to the diversity of the arithmetic market and the sustainability of the technology, to ensure that they can be invincible in the competition in the coming years. The AI arithmetic market is full of great potential, but is still in the early stages of development. While NVIDIA occupies a leading position in the AI hardware market, its high valuation and share price volatility also make the risk of a bubble",0.5575,POSITIVE,0.7135
NVIDIA’s next catalyst has to be sovereign AI.csv,"NVIDIA’s current valuation is not overtly expensive (FPER: 33, PEG: 1.61 according to FINVIZ) and the GPU orders for next year are all booked. Yet the stock is meeting strong resistance around $130. I think this is partially because a lot of people have been burned by CISCO during dot-com bubble and do not want to price in the future too much. But the real concern is that their revenue is almost entirely dependent on the rest of M7 and they are charging the big tech 80 % margin. The big tech, while being hammered by Wall Street for the increased CAPEX spending, indicated during last earning that they will not reduce their investment on AI. However, they did mention that they are/plan using their NPU (Google TPU, Tesla Dojo, AMD) to reduce the usage of NVIDIA GPU. Furthermore, GPT5 and Apple Intelligence should be available to the public by the end of this year. If these do not impress, the entire AI sector may see significant slowdown. But if GPT5 shows plateauing of performance while people find Apple Intelligence interesting, paradigm could shift toward smaller models and inference efficiency, again reducing the demand for NVIDIA. To justify significant increase in NVIDIA’s stock price, they need to show that they are not entirely dependent on the Big Tech. The only other potential buyers that have as much buying power are governments. Also, if the economy is going through downturns, governments have excuse to increase their spending. What I am paying attention to during the earning call is demonstration from NVIDIA that they are receiving significant demand from non-Big Tech such as governments.",0.5529,NEGATIVE,0.9994

Short Call Strategy Am I Regarded or Might This Actually Work.csv,"Okay, so I'm guessing a good amount of us in this subreddit were new to options trading at some point in time, and when we were just itty bitty option noobs first hearing about them, we just thought: "" Wow! this is just the same thing as betting on stocks but with leverage right?"" (might just be me when I first got into options trading but whatever). Moving on. I assume that many people's first instinct was to go and buy a call on a stock they were very bullish on. And I would assume that once we did that, we lost the entire position because we never knew how theta decay, IV, DTE, strike price, and other factors could sink your entire position. The thing about these factors is that when you buy a call, the majority of these factors are stacked against you, and if you don't want them to be completely stacked against you, you gotta pay up for a higher premium which is gonna yield the same or less of a return then the lower priced (but considerably more risky) options. You're paying for less risk. Long Calls are usually only profitable when the underlying has a significant enough uptick to outweigh all the other factors dragging down the value of the option. I'm sorry I don't mean to repeat the basics of valuing options but I think it's important to pretext them a little bit so my strategy makes more sense in the grand scheme of things. Okay, so my strategy is as follows: why buy a call, and have all of these factors stacked against you, when you can sell one, and have them work in your favor; I guess the whole basis is: the shittier the call, the better (meaning how likely it is to expire or be exercised with no value). The even better thing is we can magnify the shittiness to work in our favor on the sell side by selling balls deep out of the money calls, with low IV, and few DTE. And we can magnify this even further by selling calls on options with really shitty stocks underlying; stocks that are down 40% YTD, or just really, really stagnant not moving anywhere (might also get some sexy low IV to work in your favor there too). I don't really have any stocks in mind right now to lock this trade in off the top of my head, but $NOC and $AMD are quite down this last month and a half, and are relatively popular stocks. Like I said I need to find some better stocks for this Strat; these are not the ones I wanna go with, just what I thought of off the top of my head Now you might be saying two things: 1. ""The prices on them are probably gonna be pennies on the dollar. Sure the odds might be in your favor, but the yield is gonna be very low"", and 2. ""What fucking moron is gonna be stupid enough to buy these calls?"". To answer question 1: Why not just sell more calls? And to answer question 2: I don't think I need to illustrate the stupidity of individuals in the market, but if you need me to, here you go: WSB regards (not dissing, I am also a WSB regard who has lost thousands on YOLOs), teenagers with a Robinhood account that just found out about options, and maybe even people who are legit investors, but have bought the call as a part of some bigger options play, like a straddle, or iron condor (not to mention that in the example of the straddle, I don't think they would really give a shit if the call tanked because, well, it's a straddle lol, the put on the other side would cover the losses and make profit{and yeah there are probably more plays where this is the case that I am just forgetting about, but this is the example I'm just gonna go with for now}). Not to mention markets are huge and I've checked the open interest on some of these calls and there are hundreds going up to the thousands in open interest on balls deep OTM, 2DTE, Low IV call options. Anyways, I guess the reason I made this post is to double check with some options veteran (I've been into options for a little less than a year, but I have some knowledge on them from my job) to see if this strategy is complete delusional manic retardation, or if there is actually some substance to it. I wanna make sure there isn't some variable or factor I'm not accounting for that could tank this entire play.

Makes perfect sense that investors are flooding back into this stock! It has been so beaten down over the last six months by bad press and fears of fraud. Those fears have been quelled by a new CFO and auditing team. We just saw in the last month of 72% rally and there is still plenty of room to run on Monday it will open up around $48, the last critical level we saw was $49. Also, it looks like a somewhat sloppy cup and handle pattern is forming. My half baked technical analysis is. We will see a minor pull back around $50 to finish the pattern, then it will launch back up to the next critical level around $60 a share. Fundamentally speaking, they have been showing plenty of growth and demand for their products which mainly consists of hardware to House semiconductors, especially their trademark marked water cooled rack, which directly addresses a huge issue that centers are facing as computing power gets to Skynet levels. Their price to earnings ratio is a modest 21.9, the earnings per share is a humble 2, the ps ratio is 1.5 which is the lowest among its competitors. In fact all of its metrics or lowest amongst its competitors except for the EPS for AMD, which is 1.1. There will be much to see within the next quarterly earnings report and how they managed to address their auditing issues and reporting issues. But I think this company still has room to run and definitely has legs. I have 200 shares with plans to buy much more. I was going to buy on the next red day, expecting it to be Monday, but I digress. Next pull back I’m buying calls with a strike price of about $49-$55 exp in March. Even considering a YOLO.

"SMCI will skyrocket soon, DONT MISS OUT!.csv","So currently SMCI is around the $840 to $850 levels but hit $775 on monday. This meant that there is still a chance to buy SMCI while the shares are cheap right before they release their earnings in a month. The reason why im bullish on SMCI is because AI is driving the stock to skyrocket as they work alongside Nvidia and AMD in providing data centres. Elon musk had also catapulted the stock to reach over $1000 as he had tweeted that he is partnering with Dell and SMCI to provide AI data centres for its generative AI chatbot. https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/super-micro-computer-ceo-post-picuture-with-elon-musk-at-ai-data-center-432SI-3505317 As a result of this, SMCI will most likely smash their earnings report of $8.10 per share in early august and hopefully make the stock reach above $1100, which is a 30% increase from what the share price is today.

SMCI.csv,"Hello fellow regards, Currently SMCI is trading around the $770 to $800 range and is crucial to the future of AI as they have partnerships with Nvidia and AMD, due to providing complementary AI server systems. Due to their partnerships, and the increasing demand for AI server systems, SMCI had their EPS increase significantly as their EPS forecast is around $8.00 per share, which is a major increase from last year, which was $3.51 per share. They also have a PE ratio that is lower than Nvidia and AMD at around 45, a foward PE of 21.79 and a PEG ratio of under 1. As a result of their PEG ratio being below 1, it means that the company is considered as undervalued, and a good investment to have. The stock is down 40% from ATH and i personally believe that it could reach over $1000 by their next earnings release which is in the end of july.

Strong AI and Semiconductor weeks ahead.csv,"Hi all, I think that AI and esp. Semiconductor Stocks have a couple of strong weeks ahead. Starting on Tuesday, October 15th 2024, the Open Compute Project (OCP) global summit takes place in San Jose, California. Between 9 AM and 11:30 AM there'll be short keynotes (each 12 mins) presented by Meta, NVidia, AI Clusters, Intel, AMD, Microsoft and Google (full schedule here). Now, I don't think that there'll be any big surprises. But the Summit still presents an opportunity for public remarks about how strong the demand is or what so ever. Also, there's an article that says that Broadcom (AVGO) is going to show case cutting-edge AI infrastructure. Further it is expected that Taiwan Semiconductor Company (TSM) and ASML Holding (ASML) will publish their Q3 earnings next week. TSM will present its earnings on October 17th 2024 at 14:00 Taiwan time / 02:00 Eastern Time. So pre-market movements will most likely be wild on Thursday as a large part of the industry relies on TSM. If TSM reports a great Q3 revenue, this could push Nvidia over the current all time high. Also according to Moore's law is dead, the first RTX 5000 series GPUs are ready to be sold, but are not released because of business reasons (here at 22:22). So they could still change their mind and ship in Q4. Next, it is rumored (by moore's law is dead) that AMD will release a new CPU by the end of October or early November, the 9800X3D which is an 8 Core Gaming CPU with 3D cache and it is expected that it will be the fastest gaming CPU releasing this year. Although Client is not as important for AMD, it will still be beneficial to have this CPU released before the holiday season. Especially since Zen5 Rysen has so far been viewed as rather disappointing. Moore's law is dead also mentions an RX 7650 GRE GPU, which could launch alongside Ryzen 9800X3D. Releasing a slightly refreshed and cheap RDNA3 GPU could be a good move by AMD to get rid of RDNA3 stock ahead of the RDNA4 launch in 2025. Since the Ryzen 9800X3D has not yet been anounced, I don't think that it has been priced in and could give the stock a slight boost to recover from the -4% last Thursday. Also, I although Investors were not excited about AMDs Advancing AI event, I think AMDs position in the market is still solid. According to the slides shown at the event, AMD Epic has increased its market share to 34%. And according to tests AMD Epyc Turin obliterates Xeon 6 Granite Rapids, while being cheaper. Because of this, I think AMD is in a good position to gain more server market share. Further, the news about Nvidia Blackwell being sold out for the next 12 Months is not only good news for Nvidia but also for AMD. Sure, everyone wants blackwell. but if one can't get blackwell and if AMD Instinct MI325X is faster than Nvidia Hopper (H200), then they might be able to win over customers from nvidia, who would like to buy blackwell but can't in due time. Also, AMDs earnings should be reported on October 29 2024. Due to Ryzen Zen5 being disappointing and there being apparently a large RDNA3 stock remaining. If AMDs Instinct systems are selling well, this would also be good news for Micron Industries (MU), which produces high bandwith memory (HBM3e). And then there's Intel. Their newest releases seem to have been disappointing. But they claim to be making progress with their foundries.

To start off, we'll go big in the cap spectrum. Our millenial buys AAPL products, uses MSFT Excel and Outlook at their ""Information Worker"" job. They are frequently gamers, so they need to buy NVDA GPUs and AMD CPUs. They often buy these at AMZN. They buy YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, so they can skip the ads of their fellow influencers (GOOGL) They spent most of their waking hours at META's Instagram website. They drive a TSLA or RIVN. They're on the GLP-1 drug (LLY) to impress their SOs. They're churning their credit cards with AXP Platinum and Gold, JPM's Chase Sapphire Preffered (no, NOT Reserve), some younger ones need to rely on COF's Venture and Venture X cards that gave nice ""subs"". They use these cards frequently to eat out and earn those points at CMG, SHAK and SG. They're flying a lot on DAL, and they need their free wifi that is often sponsored by their preferred choice of mobile carrier, TMUS. To get to the airport they need to use UBER or LYFT, since they don't want to drive their sweet electric ride. When they arrive at their destination airport, they pick up their rental car, and of course they prefer AVIS (CAR), but their credit cards give them presential circle status on HTZ, so they are ok with that too. They check into their hotel room at Marriott (MAR) to impress their friends, but really they are using all their Chase points to book Hyatt (H) hotels. The slightly less premium young ones will have to go Hilton (HLT) and fly on UAL. They often booked all this travel on EXPE or BKNG. Sometimes they use ABNB. When they check in they need to get some food, so they use their DASH gift card they bought at COST every two weeks because they get 20% off. When they go to Vegas, they prefer to stay in WYNN, because it's where all the hot ones stay. After they're done with their holidaying which they do basically 4 months out of the year, they're going to ULTA or LULU to buy their beauty products or Khakis. They are drop shipping on SHOP and sometimes they need to use ZM to conduct ""business"" for their ""coaching classes"" that they teach. A lot of times they get paid using Venmo (PYPL).

"The next tech giant Why HOOD, PLTR and DKNG are the investment opportunities of a lifetime (Part 1).csv","I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong. $AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice. $NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were. And so in true wsb fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB. There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long. From a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about. And so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry : If you are under 40 years old, $HOOD (Finance), $PLTR (Defense) and $DKNG (gambling) will 100x during your investment horizon.

The short report for Intel (INTC) - A rabbit hole of CPU failures rate since 2022.csv,"Forenote: Im a technical person, A developer, this will be a technical DD to show how intel is failing to do their basic business model of manufacturing CPUs. Over the past month or so Intels customers have been becoming increasing irrate about CPUs just flat out dying after various finger pointing from Intel being debunked. I first caught wind of intels failures when a friends system started to become unstable, he would crash in games and sometimes doing mundane tasks. It all came to a clicking point when his systems files started becoming corrupted and he needed to attempt reinstalling windows. The attempts failed, windows couldnt even install without corrupted files, sometimes it would install and look fine, but running a verification shows that various system files were still corrupted but not important enough for the system to boot successfully. He would still get various crashes doing mundane things and gaming. It was basically a working brick at this point. So i got my research hat on, and discovered various reddit users on r/pcmasterrace were also reporting instability with their PCs. Not alot tho, this has been the wierd thing, Intel has such a large CPU failure rate, but not alot of reports which caught everyone by suprise. It started to make sense, the causes of the crashes were different for everything. Users were reporting issues with Nvidia, Issues with RAM, and issues with corrupted data. Obviously to any layman, these issues dont instantly point to an issue with the CPU. With GPU errors, Nvidia initially got heat, but Nvidia quickly debunked the issue reporting the GPUs that were returned were fully functional and had no issues. So I pulled out my handy dandy debug tools since my friend managed to get windows installed and it kinda runs. The first tests I ran were memory block verification. This validates that the memory is able to hold data immutably, after 4 hours the tests finished all green, the memory was stable and wasnt corrupting data. (its worth noting that the memory test software I used was very CPU lite so the CPU has little chance to corrupt the data its self, this is a stark difference to the Drive tests I ran.). Since my friend was getting corrupted files almost everytime he install anything, I ran the disk debug tools, these pull the S.M.A.R.T data from the drive and run various read and write tests. The S.M.A.R.T data came back green, the drive was reporting it had no errors or irregularies and was functioning fine, So i moved to the read and write tests, all red, the drive had a 90% file currption rate, I pulled the S.M.A.R.T data again, All green, the drive was still reporting it was functioning correctly. At this point, anyone would deduce they had a bad drive that was misbehaving, leading to the decreased number of CPU failure reports. After all, How can you say the CPU is bad when you have corrupt files? Many people forget how much the CPU is responsable for. When you read files or write files, its the CPU that tells the Drive what to store and where and what to read and where it is on the disk to read it from. and as i said, the software I used to test the drives is CPU intensive, it uses the the CPU to generate random data to store on the drive and hashes that data to verify it. So a bad CPU = Currupted data on the drive. Luckly my friend has 4 drives, So I told him to take out the ""bad"" drive and put in another one, I ran all my tests again and same result, the drive was reporting it was functional, but all the data was corrupted. The result was the same with all the drives tested. Now, this is a luxary many people dont have. Many people would get corrupted data on their drive and think the drive is dying and get a new one. However with 4 tests samples all failing the same way when days ago they were all fine is a very low chance. Now for the kicker, Intel has a tool to verify that the Intel CPU you have is a genuine Intel CPU, I guess intel has a problem of china making fake intel CPUs??? Ive never seen any but what the hell, its a useful tools since its does some basic CPU level checks. So i ran the verifier tool and its first test for a genuine CPU comes back green, Cool, it is a real Intel CPU. Memory test comes back green (We alreadt tested this soo good), next was the Graphics tests. Failed, the CPU was attempting to send data to the GPU and it corrupted the GPU memory. So now we have 2 symptoms. Disk data corruption GPU memory corruption My friend has Nvidia GPU and Nvidia previously debunked any issues with their GPUs. But we have a common cause, Intel CPUs are corrupting data when sending it to another device in the system (except RAM), Data sent to a disk gets corrupted and data sent to the GPU gets corrupted, which would explain the game crashes. Various other tests passed from boost speed changing, Wifi tests and math operations. After I finished all the tests and determed the issue is with the CPU, my friend RMA'd the CPU. This is where more troubles start. Intel refused the RMA, citing user damage, According to intel all the issues my friend was having was his fault and he caused the damage, After it was refused, I filed the RMA for him, to the same response, but because im a stickler I pushed for more info, Intel was refusing the RMA because of overclocking done by the motherboard. This is a previous blame game intel played, they were blaming Motherboards for putting in stock overclocks on CPUs causing them to fail, but this wasnt the case with my friend, his motherboard wasnt even stock overclocked, but intel refused it anyway. After this point is when the waterfall started coming down, a advanced tech-youtuber posted an exposé about intels CPU failures. See: Intel has a HUGE problem - Level1Tech the curtains were starting to fall, Apparently Game developers and datacenters (Intels BIGGEST customers) were getting large amounts of CPU failures specificly with intel CPUs. Now datacenters are normally quiet about this type of thing, opting to sort their issues directly with intel, but intel is turning away datacenters RMA's of thousands of CPUs, these datacenters has since publicly reported they are dropping intel systems from their products and only supporting AMD systems from now on. Intel has lost their largest customer base, because of their defective products and refusing to take responsability for the product inherit flaw. Intel is hoping this goes unnoticed, since reports are still low of CPUs failing because the errors are random and different each time and users dont know their CPU is defective, there isnt a big in your face ""The Intel CPU in this system has errored"" its always an error with something else, which is caused by the CPU. So intel is betting on customers blaming other manufactures like they did with Nvidia when this all started. Timeline of events: [Dec 2022] The first instances of ""Out of Video Memory"" issues on 13th Gen Core i9 CPUs were reported back in 2022. (Source: Reddit). This is a few months after the release of Intel's 13th Gen CPUs & RTX 40 GPUs. [Throughout 2023] Several users have started reporting game crashes and issues in high-profile AAA titles such as Callisto Protocol and Hogwarts Legacy (among many others). Both tiles are based on Unreal Engine (released in 2023) and feature a shader compilation process at the start. There are currently thousands of such issues reported on Steam Community Forums and Reddit. [February 2024] A post by Sebastian Castellanos brings the issue to the limelight, highlighting the ""worrying trend"" of stability issues affecting 14th and 13th-gen CPUs. [February 2024] Our editor along with various other tech outlets start reporting the issue and bringing the matter on to the mainstream media. Quickly, it is pointed out that underclocking and undervolting the chips can result in better stability. [April 2024] NVIDIA Issued a formal statement that the stability issues are not related to its GPUs but rather Intel CPUs. [April 2024] Intel announces its investigation of the reports of instability issues affecting 13th and 14th Gen CPUs. [April 2024] Oodle Publishes about their discovery about users Intel systems experiencing data corruption. [April 2024] Motherboard makers quickly roll out ""Baseline"" power profiles in new BIOS, which lower power limits on high-end 14th & 13th Gen CPUs but also lead to significant performance drops. [May 2024] Intel releases a statement, recommending motherboard makers to ship ""Intel Default Settings"" in BIOS by default rather than customized settings. [June 2024] Intel discovers a bug within its eTVB microcode while investigating the root cause of 14th and 13th Gen Instability issues. This doesn't fix the instability problems. Board makers quickly roll out BIOS with a new microcode fix. [June 2024] Alderon Games publishes about there players, developers and servers Intel CPUs failing over a period of months and switch to only AMD systems. [July 2024] Intel denies an RMA to HardwareTimes editor who already RMA'd at least two CPUs which produced instability issues. [July 2024] Wendell from Level1Techs & Steve Burke from GamersNexus are the first big tech media outlets on YouTube to further highlight the instability issues, diving into additional details such as OEM frustration with the matter and a possible recall. [July 2024] GamersNexus highlights a potential ""oxidation"" defect being a problem with a certain batch of Intel 14th & 13th Gen CPUs that might lead to instability problems. [July 2024] Intel says the 14th & 13th Gen Mobile CPUs are not affected by the same instability issues as the desktop CPUs. [July 2024] GamersNexus reports they will not be recommending Intel CPUs regardless of the outcome for upcoming AMD 9000 series reviews [July 2024] Intel issues a statement confirming that they have found the root cause of the instability issues which happen to be elevated operating voltages and will be issuing a new microcode fix to its partners by mid of August [July 2024] Users are reporting instability issues with Intel 14th gen Laptop CPUs.

Edit: Ive received internal leaks from Intel employees explaining internal issues and intels failures. Source 1: The leading theory inside Intel right now, and it is just a theory, is that the Ring Bus is getting cooked because it's fed by the same rail as the P-Cores and E-Cores. Raptor Lake required incredibly high voltages that the clocks required to be competitive with Zen 4, and it seems like it was just pushed too hard. This is an inherent flaw that would be in Bartlett too it's overvolted. Meteor Lake isn't affected, and Emerald Rapids is unlikely be effected materially. Source 2: I never worked directly on Raptor Lake [Intel Design Engineer], but I did have exposure to Alder Lake, and I can confirm that they were very concerned about the ring bus getting damaged if the voltage was pushed too high. I can also confirm that Raptor Lake was rushed through the design and validation process... Source 3: I [Intel Foundry Services] can tell you that Raptor Lake was rushed through our Fab in Arizona in record time, but it's also produced in other fabs. However, this location (Arizona) is notable because I can confirm that there was an Oxidation issue caused by some failure in our HVAC system between March & June of 2023. It was so bad that Keyvan Esfarjani had to fly in to make decision about which wafers (which cost as much as a Model X each) needed to be thrown away. To be clear, I don't know what decision was made, but I do know that this event DID happen. And by the way, it affected Sapphire Rapids yields as well...although I doubt it's an issue that wasn't",0.5221,NEGATIVE,0.9929

Update on Intel Short report - We won.csv,"Update of The short report for Intel (INTC) - A rabbit hole of CPU failures rate since 2022. Yes while the main points of the short report were not mentioned and intel continues to hide this infomation from Investors, they cant ignore the impact it has on their bottom line. RMA's are not cheap and the amount of money and time they are spending to fix the issue for existing chips while trying their hardest to deny RMAs for failed CPUs. Customers have lost faith in Intel, their chips are constantly beaten by AMD offerings and having a high failure rate really was the last nail in the coffin.

VSH - The Forgotten King of Chips.csv,"TLDR: $VSH (Vishay Intertechnology) is printing money while everyone sleeps on it. $VSH just got the stamp of approval from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, confirming it as a hidden winner in Nvidia’s AI and RTX 50 supply chain. With key wins in MOSFETs, capacitors, and resistors, $VSH is now primed for explosive growth, riding Nvidia’s dominance in AI servers and GPUs. If you’re not jacked up on $VSH, you’re not meant to have money. Who is $VSH? Vishay Intertechnology is a veteran in the electronics industry. They make essential components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and semiconductors. You know, the boring stuff that makes your GPU, PS5, and electric toothbrush actually work. They’ve been doing this since 1962. That’s right, this company has survived every market downturn, bubble, and chip shortage in the last 60+ years. Meanwhile, you can’t even survive a red day on SPY. Why $VSH is printing money: Chips are everywhere—cars, phones, smart homes, AI servers. The global semiconductor market is growing at an insane pace (projected $1 trillion market by 2030). Guess what? Vishay is supplying the guts. Look at their P/E ratio: 12.5 (as of last check). Compare that to Nvidia’s 75+ or AMD’s 30-ish. $VSH is practically trading at the bargain bin, and yet their revenues are consistently strong. Vishay’s last earnings report crushed expectations, with double-digit growth in several segments. They’re sitting on $3.4B in annual revenue with plans to scale. Oh, and they’re buying back shares like they’re on clearance at Costco. Everyone’s hyped about Nvidia because of AI. Guess what? Vishay supplies components used in AI hardware, EV charging stations, and industrial automation. While Nvidia makes the sexy GPUs, Vishay sells the boring but essential resistors and capacitors that keep those GPUs from melting your motherboard. They’re eating up the market share. Recent Catalysts: Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo dropped a bombshell: Vishay is a key supplier for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI servers (GB200 series, DGX/HGX B200) and the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. These are Nvidia’s future bread-and-butter products, dominating AI and high-end gaming. Vishay replaced Infineon as Nvidia’s MOSFET supplier. Yes, Infineon, the semiconductor giant, just got sidelined. This Is MASSIVE for $VSH. Vishay is providing MOSFET/DrMOS (VRPower), vPolyTan (Polymer Tantalum Capacitors), and Current Shunt Resistors. These components are critical for Nvidia’s most cutting-edge products: • GB200 series AI servers: Nvidia’s next-gen AI infrastructure. • RTX 50 series GPUs: The next flagship graphics cards. Vishay’s vPolyTan capacitors (especially the T55 series) are already facing a supply crunch for 2025. That’s how in-demand they are. Kuo estimates that Vishay’s MOSFET production alone will contribute 20%-30% of revenue by 2025—with above-average gross profit margins. The vPolyTan capacitors will add a high single-digit percentage of revenue with significantly above-average margins. Translation? Vishay is printing money. Vishay’s production lines are already at capacity through 2025. When your biggest challenge is meeting demand, you’re in a good spot. Beyond Nvidia, Vishay is also poised to benefit from: • Automotive rebound: As EV production scales, Vishay’s components are critical. • IoT growth: Billions of devices mean billions of tiny components. Vishay is at the center of it. The Stock Is Still Cheap Even after today’s 7% jump to $18.35, $VSH is wildly undervalued. As I said earlier, the P/E ratio is still around 12-13, compared to Nvidia’s 75+. This is a company with real earnings, real dividends, and real growth potential. This is a great opportunity to make back everything you lost from your MSTR calls. Positions: Shares, 01/17/25 20C",0.5352,POSITIVE,0.9824

"Weekly jobless claims fall to 233,000, less than expected, in a positive sign for labor market.csv","Last night, the U.S. announced that the number of initial unemployment claims for last week was 233,000, significantly lower than the previous week's 249,000 and also below the market's expectation of 240,000! A few days ago, Mr. Wang mentioned that for the U.S. stock market to stop declining, the economic and labor data released must continue to be strong in order to ease concerns about a potential economic recession. Yesterday's sharp drop in initial unemployment claims marked the largest decrease in a year, indicating that the number of people recently unemployed has decreased. This alleviated the recession concerns raised by last Friday's non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate data, spurring a rally in U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 index surging over 2.3%, the largest single-day gain in 21 months 📈. On the other hand, the demand for the 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds at the auctions over the past two days was poor, causing the 10-year yield to exceed 4% once again! Tech giants saw a broad rebound, with Meta rising 4.2%, Alphabet up 1.9%, Amazon gaining 1.8%, Apple increasing 1.6%, and Microsoft rebounding 1%. Nvidia surged over 6%, returning to the $100 mark, leading to a rebound in semiconductor stocks. Broadcom, Micron, and Applied Materials all jumped more than 6%, while Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and AMD all saw gains of over 5%! Taiwan's ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) also rebounded, with TSMC and UMC both jumping more than 6%, and ASE gaining over 4%. However, it's still important to note that the number of continuing unemployment claims is rising, reaching its highest level since November 2021, nearly three years ago! Therefore, Wall Street's foreign investors remain concerned about the economy. For example, JPMorgan still believes the U.S. economy will enter a recession, raising the probability from 25% to 35%!

Why I am going long on Intel and letting Bad Daddy Gelsinger take me to Uranus - DD TurboNerd Post.csv,"TLDR: This stock fucking sucks, and I love it. But the developing foundry business is gonna get absolutely bananas under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for the sole purpose of developing it. They are not gonna let the other chip companies continue to take nut shots on them and they are just gonna make everyone chips for them. Anyways I all in on Mar 2025 Calls (which are like $4.50 - $5.00) right now. Here is some DD. Dog of the Dow Intel has lagged behind other chip titans such as [[AMD - AMD]] and [[NVDA -NVIDIA]] as they race to design and build chips to handle [[AI]] workloads. Both AMD and NVIDA have seen tremendous growth over the past 18 months (as of June 2024). A growth pattern that has gone completely unanswered by INTEL up until this point. Looking at the [[Price to Earnings Ratio]] of both AMD and NVIDIA it is easy to see how disconnected from earnings they have become (though they are both incredibly profitable). AMD P/E Ratio: 67.30 NVIDIA P/E Ratio: 238.53 INTEL P/E Ratio 31.79 AMD is wildly inflated relative to its competition in the space. NVDA is has a more ""sane"" price to earnings but it has also been nearly printing its own money with the amount of sales it has been making. The price of NVIDIA still ""feels"" high despite it's recent split. Another interesting metric to take a look at is the [[Price/Tangible Book]] - Where you take the current price of the stock and compare it to the tangle value of all its assets minus good will. AMD P/TB Ratio: 23.61 NVIDIA P/TB Ratio: 64.73 INTEL P/TB Ratio: 1.75 This says a few things; One either Intel has barely any assets worth liquidating relative to its stock price and the market has priced the stock appropriately, OR the price of the stock is selling for a very reasonable price related to the actual value of the company. This could be considered paying only .75 above book value of the company as a ""premium"" for future expected value. Source: Any trading platform that has data you ding dongs - go look it up. I got these from Schwab jfc. Technical Except for this past Wednesday, this company has been hard stuck around $30 after a selloff from its 52 week high of $51.28. 31.50 appears to be the most reliable resistance level we can work off of right now, then $32.50 after that. If it breaks both of those on a run up, there is literally no ceiling until $46. SO, you tell me what that means. The further you zoom out on your shitty little trading app the more you will see that this period we are in is nothing but consolidation. Foundry Intel's new foundry business will be the corner stone of its future growth. Forget the in house made chips. The company is not-so-silently tyring to be the American version of TSMC. Here is an article they posted on their own site outlining their model. https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-outlines-new-financial-reporting-structure.html#gs.a8z07s Note this section: April 9th 2024 ""Intel Foundry is a newly established operating segment that includes foundry technology development, foundry manufacturing and supply chain, and foundry services (formerly IFS). Under this new structure, Intel Foundry will recognize revenues generated from both external foundry customers and Intel Products..."" Fuck me, if they pull this off under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for this specific function, this stock could easily moon. Not to mention this article detailing that NVIDIA will start using Intels Foundry to start making its own chips. https://www.techspot.com/news/101725-nvidia-turning-intel-foundry-services-expand-gpu-ai.html#:~:text=Nvidia%20could%20also%20choose%20to,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202024. Chips Act ""U.S. Department of Commerce has proposed up to $8.5 billion in direct funding through the CHIPS and Science Act to advance Intel’s commercial semiconductor projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon. Intel also expects to benefit from a U.S. Treasury Department Investment Tax Credit (ITC) of up to 25% on more than $100 billion in qualified investments and eligibility for federal loans up to $11 billion. Proposed funding supports Intel’s previously announced plans to invest more than $100 billion in the U.S. over five years to expand U.S. chipmaking capacity and capabilities critical to economic and national security and acceleration of emerging technologies, such as AI. Intel’s investments are expected to create more than 10,000 company jobs and nearly 20,000 construction jobs, and to support more than 50,000 indirect jobs with suppliers and supporting industries. "" https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/us-chips-act-intel-direct-funding.html#gs.a8z5ze So yea Intel is gonna get paid, and quite a bit. The article states that they are slated to receive up to $8.5 billion, with a B. X86 chips - Speculation With Arm taking dominance over portable computers like laptops, tablets and phones, X86 looks pretty boring. Except you have to remember that both AMD and Intel are still cranking these bad boys out like nobody's business. The raw horsepower in these for desktop workstations and servers is still not matched by ARM and probably wont be for quite a while. Sure they are not quite as power efficient, but who cares in a data center or major compute space anyways. Intel owns almost all of the IP for X86 processors too. AMD has a little bit and they have made improvements and designs of their own that they have been able to patent, but INTEL is the OG maker of these chips. Arm will probably continue to dominate the landscape, but they are the people who license their chips are going to need them made somewhere. They will have like two options. Intel or TSMC. China What happens when CHYNA pulls the trigger and takes over Taiwan. Where is everyone gonna have their chips made? Arizona, that's where. TSMC and Intel are both setting up MASSIVE Fabs there. So, when all the other chip companies get absolutely smoked I expect to see a giant green candle on that morning for INTC. I will probably write more later but this shit got way long way fast.

Why I bought Puts on MNST (Monster).csv,"Since Monster releases its earnings report after market, it’s time for some puts… or calls if you are based and want to inverse me Reason 1: High expectations - Current expectations for this quarterly are quite high.. Expected earnings per share are $0.452 as opposed to the $0.400 of a year ago . In this same light the market expects (has already priced in) a nearly 200 million dollar increase in revenue from the year prior.. Put quite simply these massive increases are already expected and priced in, and it’s much easier to fall short when expectations are this high Reason 2: Competition - PepsiCo is fighting hard for market share of the energy drink market and threw $550 million dollars for an 8.5% share of Celsius in 2022. Monster has already struggled to maintain market share versus Red Bull, which owns the largest portion of the energy drink market.. Now on top of this already stiff competition they have to deal with a whale like PepsiCo flooding the market with products like Rockstar and Celsius over time Reason 3: regulation- As more health focused initiatives take place in Europe and America, products like monster will face increased scrutiny, both from consumers and governments alike (regulations on certain contents). Reason 4: Even those who hit their goals have been getting smashed… AMD and Reddit- Now I get what you are thinking “what the heck do these companies have to do with monster”… and yea they have no direct relationship.. But even after surpassing their goals for this last quarter these companies have seen their value get smashed.. The market is being mad weird and bearish right now when it comes to earnings. So in essence this combined with reason 1 (the high goals they already have), means that I feel that the odds favor the Put/bear side Hope you enjoyed my presentation!!

"Why I think Intel is a Misunderstood, Undervalued Play – A Bet on 18A (+EV DD).csv","Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.",0.5307,NEGATIVE,0.9997
Why Intel is the most undervalued tech stock right now.csv,"Intel ($INTC) is an insane bargain right now, as it is trading at year 1999 stock price. Every other comparable tech stock is up 5000%-20000% since then. People are too focused on Intel consumer and data center products, which by the way are improving at impressive rate. Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3). Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD & NVIDIA offerings. But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment. Currently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons. Microsoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in.

Since 2021 (before my dad got this cancer shit), I spoke with him and he basically said just look at the fundamentals of a company and invest in growth companies that you think will be around in 5-10 years. I look for value within growth stocks (i know paradoxical). Some of my icons in investing are David Tepper & Michael Burry. Again below is all my own experience and reflects only my own views and are not a recommendation of my company (corporate. disclaimer). My portfolio is heavily weighted (85%) between several stocks: AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL (So fucking cheap r u kidding me sorry), NVDA, AMZN, AMD, CRM, COST, RIVN (RIP), AVGO, VOO (ik not a stock) <-- I know semi(s) are very cyclical but i believe in holding all of these companies for 5-10 years, so I don't have to worry about temp. earnings beats/misses etc. Much easier to pick a stock and hold it for a while then it is to get the timing right. Roughly at 175% return in the past 3 years. (hammered META at $100's, NVDA at $200 both in 2022) Roughly 15% of my bets are moonshots (note the word bet hehe) with promise but objectively could be overvalued/bad investments: CCL/RCL (both are crushing it and between them own 75% of the cruise line market), LCID/RIVN (going to 0 bc they can't scale profitably or will make u a very happy person 3 years down the line bc R2/Atlas at 45k/50k should capture a significant portion of model y demand), TTD, DKNG/FLUT - gambling hasn't even been legalized in Cali/Texas (the biggest markets in the U.S. come on), RBLX (feels like betting against youtube in the early innings w/o realizing how much rev. they're actually recognizing), PYPL (value - cheap af (bought at $60) should turn around in a couple years) I joke I allocate like google's budget where it's 90% bread&butter and the rest are moonshots. Was very depressed (still reasonably depressed) because I'm not sure how much time my dad has. I hope in a way I can pass some of these stocks to my kid in a better place than I found it.

"Advanced Micro Devices to See Continued Share Gains in Notebook, Server Processors, Morgan Stanley.csv","Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is poised for continued share gains in notebook and server processors through 2025, according to Morgan Stanley's analysis of the company's product roadmap. Morgan Stanley anticipates that AMD's core business will ""accelerate meaningfully"" as the PC market continues to recover and server upgrades resume. The investment firm noted that AMD is likely to capture a disproportionate share of these larger projects as upgrades progress. AMD's increased Q3 revenue guidance of about $6.7 billion at the midpoint reflects ""strong momentum across compute businesses,"" according to Morgan Stanley. This momentum underscores the company's effective strategy and execution, positioning it well for sustained growth. Artificial intelligence is also expected to be a significant growth driver for AMD. The company's advancements in AI technology and its strategic roadmap place it in a favorable position to capitalize on the burgeoning AI market. While there are potential delays in the deployment of new AI silicon, the overall outlook remains robust. Morgan Stanley maintains an equal-weight rating on Advanced Micro Devices and has raised its price target to $178 from $176, reflecting confidence in the company's future performance. AMD's strategic positioning and continued execution of its roadmap suggest a promising trajectory. As the PC market recovers and server upgrades accelerate, AMD is well-positioned to capture a significant share of these markets, driving further growth and reinforcing its competitive edge in the industry.",0.5943,POSITIVE,0.9953

AI chipmaker Cerebras files for IPO to take on Nvidia - But 87% of its revenues have come from the U.csv,"The Middle East wants chips badly but US restrictions prevent the US most powerful chips entering into certain geographical areas such as China and the Middle East; this entails the UAE. Nevertheless, the UAE wants in on the GPU chips craze and is apparently willing to pay anything to enter into the chip bonanza. The UAE can't get Nvidia's, AMD's, or Intel's best GPU chips so instead they are investing heavily into alternatives such as Cerebras. There is nothing inherently wrong with this but it's also the biggest red flag as an investment opportunity. If the agreements for Nvidia chips open up in the Middle East and specifically with the UAE that could be a crushing blow to this aspiring startup. Specifically, Cerebras Systems reported a net loss of $66.6 million for the first six months of 2024, on $136.4 million in revenue. For the same period in 2023 it has a net loss of $77.8 million on just $8.7 million in sales. 87% of this revenue for the first half of 2024 was directly from the UAE G42. The other red flag from this startup is the way in which they promote their business. It's all seemingly smoke and mirrors and conveniently based on outdated GPU pricing and throughput information; which is very publically available. For some reason, Groq and Cerebras love to keep using memory to unlock speeds on small/tiny models which is impractical and inefficient for a scaled system; or a system that is a large foundational LLM. As well, they have no clue what models will do next so it's a major after the fact architecture that uses llama because they have access to it. https://cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebras-inference-ai-at-instant-speed. A prime example of this is OpenAI's GPT-o1 model that uses reasoning in coordination with its model capabilities. Because they are not being used on the forefront of this technology they don't know how or when a model's size, function, or needs will evolve into the future. All of this plus the pricing from OpenAI and Microsoft is coming down exponentially. For Example: They are referring to a 70b param model that shoves an entire model onto memory. They are going up against h100's which is a very old technology at this point. They make no reference to h200's let alone blackwell Because they are referencing such a small model the pricing model they suggest would be radically different for a 400b param model and forget about trillion param models which are coming next. They're not being truthful about tokens per s. As of today this is Azure GPT 4o and GPT 4 mini tokens per minute gpt-4o & GPT-4 Turbo global standard Model Tier Quota Limit in tokens per minute (TPM) Requests per minute gpt-4o Enterprise agreement 30 M 180 K gpt-4o-mini Enterprise agreement 50 M 300 As you can clearly see 30 million tokens per minute is 500k tokens per second and mini is 833,333 tokens per second. So i don't know why they are referring to 20 tokens per second or their 450 tokens per second seems way off. maybe they mean million. Even if that is the case and 70 b would be more like mini it is way higher than their limit. On pricing which they lay out a 3:1 input versus output is fine the price would be for mini which is a comparable model is roughly .10 cents (input) + .20 cents = .30 cents. Per million. for regular 4o it would be higher and let's face it GPT 4o is a far superior model than llama 3.1 3.33 dollar + 5 = $8.33 Source: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/ From this information what I can tell you is that what we just went over is pricing. it is not some guarantee for what a model produces per second. That shit is very random. What I can tell you is from GPT 4 to GPT 4 turbo to Gpt 4o the speed is dramatically better. GPT 4o mini is damn near real time. Take that for what it's worth. I am not saying they're being dishonest here but I am saying they are being very cheeky with how they advertise things. The company is currently being primarily supported by the UAE, with investments worth roughly $900 million for new AI supercomputers known as the Condor Galaxy series. Any growth here is singular to this source of investment and not driven by organic growth or usage. This is not a competitor to Nvidia but rather a temporary solution in the Middle East until chip embargoes are alleviated. The media here loves to use sexy headlines on non-technical verifications of what it is they are actually comparing. I.e. H100's are now old, or The fact an entity may need to serve millions of clients... No they are instead reporting self-prompting headlines from Cerebras that say things like our chips are 20x faster than Nvidia. Live Update: As I am writing and researching this topic it has just been reported by Reuters that the U.S. is setting a new rule to allow chip shipments to the Middle East including the UAE which is a boon to Nvidia and Microsoft. US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East Here are couple excerpts: WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), to data centers in the Middle East. G42, a UAE-based AI company with historic ties to China, has been a focus of those concerns. In April, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), opens new tab announced that it would invest $1.5 billion in the company, with plans to provide G42 with chips and model weights, sophisticated data that improves an AI model's ability to emulate human reasoning.The deal drew scrutiny from China hardliners in Congress, even though G42 said in February that it had divested from China and was accepting constraints imposed on it by the United States to work with American companies. LOL you can't make this up. Literally this just got reported by Reuters today 9/30/2024. This completely aligns with my argument above regarding the UAE-G42. With chips now entering into the Middle East from Nvidia and potentially others I don't know how this startup IPO makes it off the ground. I don't mean to be bearish but I don't think this is the time for them to raise an IPO without showing more progress. I could be wrong. As of now, I don't plan on buying any shares. Instead, I will be adding more shares into Nvidia because now this is bullish news for Nvidia.",0.5441,NEGATIVE,1.0

AMD CEO Lisa Su Says AI Is In Early Stages Of Multiyear 'Supercycle' 'There's Tremendous Need For Mo.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) shares are experiencing an upward trend after the company reported strong second-quarter financial results. Following the announcement, CEO Lisa Su emphasized that the chipmaker’s performance is being driven by a multiyear AI “supercycle.” What To Know: Recently, chip stocks saw a sell-off as earnings season approached, with investors questioning the timeline for significant returns on the massive investments in AI. This led to speculation that spending on AI might slow down. However, early earnings reports indicate that capital expenditures have remained robust. Su’s comments on CNBC’s “Squawk On The Street” Wednesday provide reassurance against slowdown concerns. She stated, “From the conversations that I have with our customer set and sort of the broader industry, we can see that AI is a multiyear, you know, I would call it a supercycle frankly. There’s tremendous need for more compute.” AMD reported second-quarter revenue of $5.835 billion and adjusted earnings of 69 cents per share, surpassing analyst estimates as its AI business continues to see accelerating demand. The chipmaker also updated its forecast, expecting GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion this year, up from the previous forecast of more than $4 billion. Su highlighted that analysts and investors are “hypersensitive” to minor quarter-over-quarter changes. She believes that the AI story should be viewed in a broader context, suggesting that the demand is extraordinarily high. “I wouldn’t be hypersensitive in those areas ... Are more customers using it? Is every enterprise asking for it? Are we seeing more applications on a daily, weekly, monthly basis? The answer to that is absolutely yes,” she said. “Everywhere I go, everyone wants to talk about how can we incorporate AI into our businesses faster and more efficiently ... this early in the cycle, there’s a lot of learning and experimentation, but definitely, there will be the return on the investment on the other side,” Su added. Although the return on investment isn’t “instantaneous,” it’s occurring very quickly. AI is already boosting productivity and enabling companies to bring better products to market faster. Su emphasized, “We’re investing today for the return in a couple of years, and I think that’s absolutely the right thing to do. That’s the way to think about these investment cycles.” AMD’s strategic focus on AI and its strong financial performance underscore its robust position in the rapidly evolving technology landscape, highlighting the company’s potential for sustained growth in the coming years.",0.5537,NEGATIVE,0.8673

Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year. This report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure. With Nvidia's earnings report on the horizon, AMD's results offer a useful benchmark. Although AMD has significantly underperformed Nvidia year-to-date, this could be an opportunity to turn the tables. Data Center Growth is Key Analysts predict AMD's data center revenue will reach a record $3.52 billion for Q3. In July, CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in strong revenue growth for the year's second half, driven by demand for Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. Earlier this month, AMD launched its latest data center AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, and investors are keen to see its performance. Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari pointed to sustained growth in AI infrastructure capital expenditure, a recovery in server CPUs, and AMD's ongoing market share gains.

"Apple reportedly seeks to lock out its competitors from TSMC's 2nm process, by booking all of its ma.csv","Apple has long been cozy with TSMC, the manufacturer of the chips that end up in ever-popular iPhone, iPad and Mac products. When you've got as much cash on hand as Apple does, it puts it in a favorable position to negotiate deals with the Taiwan-based chipmaker. Now it is reportedly seeking to lock in 100% of TSMC's bleeding edge 2nm production capacity, giving it a competitive advantage when products eventually make their way to the market. According to 9to5mac (via Extreme tech), Apple's chief operating officer met with TSMC bosses to negotiate terms to secure 2nm capacity. The report cites 'local sources', so there needs to be a pinch of salt here, but given Apple's track record of locking up TSMC's capacity, this would certainly come as no surprise. TSMC's 2nm process is currently scheduled to enter risk production in 2025, with volume production set for the second half of 2025. That means the upcoming iPhone 16 family with A18 chips will stick with 3nm, but it could mean the high end iPhone 17 Pro and Max could be the first in line to be built with 2nm technology. The specifics of deals between TSMC and its customers are obviously not made public, but it is widely accepted that Apple booked all of TSMC's 3nm capacity, at least for a period of time. These chips, including the A17 and M3 families made their way into the latest generation iPhone 15 Pros and MacBooks. That would make Apple's 2nm play unsurprising. It's easy to see why Apple would attempt to secure the maximum amount of 2nm capacity. It will give it an advantage over its competitors, as 2nm chips will allow Apple to pack in more transistors into a given area, leading to better performance or lower power consumption—if not both. Samsung has its own manufacturing capacity, and future Exynos chips will be built in-house, but 2nm Snapdragon and possibly Google Tensor chips may have to wait in line behind Apple. Even mega-companies such as Google and Qualcomm don't have the cash on hand to outbid big daddy Apple. It's not just Arm competitors that will be disadvantaged. Nvidia will want every possible power and performance advantage it can get as it dominates the market for AI processors, while AMD will also have to wait for access to the best nodes. Even Intel could find itself at a disadvantage given some of the tiles for its chips are manufactured by TSMC.

"BEARISH NVDA Development Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Intel developing open standard AI Accelerator .csv","Full Article: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-giants-form-industry-group-120000567.html NVDA's current GPU (AIPU) market domination currently stands at 85-95% of the accelerator market. This is pushing profit margins to extreme levels, protected by a moat defended by CUDA and their consistent R&D in the space, leading to further chip advancements along inference and power efficiencies at a much faster pace than their competitors (AMD/INTEL in particular). This new open standards alliance (UALink Promoter Group) for the interconnect (a.k.a backbone) of server clusters challenges NVDA's own proprietary interconnect systems, but will likely not be able to compete with the new B200 line being delivered in the coming months, due to its extreme efficiencies across GPUs and clusters. However, this new alliance is interesting, and combined with the hyperscalers consistently developing in-house specialized chips for model training and inferences, we will likely see a gradual decrease of market domination over the next 2-5 years. Overall, this seems like a BEARISH development for NVDA",0.5448,POSITIVE,0.9841

Bloomberg Again Reports on Semiconductors With Flimsy Information on Secret Government Contacts.csv,"Usually, when things that are leaked with an intention the entity where the leak comes from is pleased with said leak. Not for Bloomberg though. Bloomberg actually accomplishes citing an anonymous source about on ongoing discussions related to chip distribution and subsequently takes that information to the White House National Security Council to ask them to comment. Here is the WHNSC's response. Bloomberg: US Weighs Capping Exports of AI Chips From Nvidia and AMD to Some Countries A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the talks but pointed to a recent joint statement by the US and UAE on artificial intelligence. In it, the two countries acknowledged the “tremendous potential of AI for good,” as well as the “challenges and risks of this emerging technology and the vital importance of safeguards.” The council responds with a no comment while directing them to a positive statement. To me, this greatly diminishes whomever the Bloomberg contact is. This is the second time that Bloomberg goes out of their way citing a leaky government source that on it's own merits isn't really that sensational at all. The headline is sensational the reality is not. The approach would set a ceiling on export licenses for certain countries in the interest of national security, according to the people, who described the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Officials are focused on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing appetite for AI data centers and the deep pockets to fund them, the people said. This isn't even news. Reuters reported on this a month ago with a much more neutral to positive tone. Which it is. Reuters: US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia to data centers in the Middle East.Since October 2023, U.S. exporters have been required to obtain licenses before shipping advanced chips to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.Under the new rule, data centers will be able to apply for Validated End User status that will allow them to receive chips under a general authorization, rather than requiring their U.S. suppliers to obtain individual licenses to ship to them. If you're tracking, this simply seems to be the 2nd half of that original conversation. There are already chip restrictions. Nvidia is already not delivering the most advanced chips to those countries. The framework proposed would allow Nvidia to deliver chips under certain restrictions and guidelines. Bloomberg acknowledges this towards the tail end of the article. While officials have debated the best approach, they’ve slowed high-volume AI chip license approvals to the Middle East and elsewhere. But there are signs things could get moving soon: Under the new rules for shipments to data centers, US officials will vet and preapprove specific customers based on security commitments from both the companies and their national governments, paving the way for easier licensing down the road. What I don't understand is why does Bloomberg like to make things salacious when they're seemingly not. There is 0 chips to parts of the Middle-East today, but the U.S. government is working on a framework that may relieve that. Reuter story from a month ago. The end. When you read the headline one would believe that they are already selling these chips to the UAE and they're not.",0.5344,NEGATIVE,1.0

For the US and European AI Software Sector the restrictions should be regarded as good news, because with less systems being sold abroad, they won't have to wait that long for their orders.

Could PLTR go on a TSLA-like Run (70%) if Included in SP500.csv,"On June 7th, S&P 500 is set to rebalance and Palantir will be eligible for the third time. With the spotlight on AI and Palantir's continued strong performance, there's a very high likelihood it is included in the S&P, which could lead PLTR going on a Tesla-like run. First, let me break down why Palantir is a great candidate for inclusion. Inclusion in the S&P 500 index involves meeting several stringent criteria related to market capitalization, liquidity, financial viability, and corporate governance. For Palantir Technologies (PLTR) to be considered a good candidate for S&P 500 inclusion, it must satisfy these key requirements: Market Capitalization: A company must have a market cap of at least $14.6 billion (as of 2023). Palantir's market capitalization has been above this threshold for a while. Liquidity: Companies need to have adequate liquidity, with a high trading volume. Palantir's shares are actively traded, reflecting strong investor interest and sufficient liquidity. Financial Viability: The company must report positive earnings in the most recent quarter and over the last four quarters combined. Palantir has demonstrated profitability, reporting positive GAAP EPS in recent quarters (InvestorPlace). U.S. Based: Companies must be U.S.-based, with the majority of their assets and revenues derived from the U.S. Palantir fits this criterion, being headquartered in Denver, Colorado, and deriving significant revenue from U.S. operations. Public Float: At least 50% of a company's shares must be in the public float. Palantir's public float percentage is adequate to meet this requirement, with substantial institutional ownership indicating wide distribution among public shareholders Palantir meets all the eligibility criteria, the only which could be a problem is corporate governance, ie, the insiders own a lot of shares of the company; however there are tons of examples of other companies that have a similar structure. As many of you know, Tesla went on a 70% in the weeks leading up to and the month following its inclusion. However, it's not alone. Many other ""sexy/high-profile"" names go on epic runs when SP500 inclusion is announced. Twitter (TWTR) Inclusion Date: June 7, 2018 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $26 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on May 21, 2018, Twitter's stock increased by approximately 14%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, Twitter's stock increased by about 5%. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2019 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2019, NXP's stock rose by approximately 10%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, NXP's stock increased by around 6%. AMD (Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.) (AMD) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2017 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $20 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2017, AMD's stock increased by approximately 12%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, AMD's stock rose by around 9%. T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS) Inclusion Date: June 22, 2020 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on June 5, 2020, T-Mobile's stock increased by approximately 8%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, T-Mobile's stock saw an increase of about 7%. NVIDIA (NVDA) Inclusion Date: November 18, 2001 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $25 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: NVIDIA's stock saw a significant rise, roughly around 20-25%, in the weeks leading up to the inclusion. Month Following Inclusion: The stock continued to perform well, with an additional increase of around 10-15%. ""S&P 500 effect,"" is a real phenomenon and I think it's even more powerful with high-profile names like Palantir. As mentioned earlier, Tesla went on a god-like run in the weeks leading up to and after the announcement. And I think Palantir shares many characteristics with Tesla that may see it go on a similar run. Both companies have a very high-profile CEO. Alex Karp is loved by Palantir holders just like Elon is by Tesla fanboys, which leads to my most important point: retail ownership. Palantir has a significant amount of its shares outstanding owned by retail; if SP500 inclusion is announced and institutions have to buy shares it may create a similar move like Tesla's as most palantir fanboys won't sell. Like Tesla, they believe Palantir is changing the world (look at their subreddit). I think buying Palantir options is a great upside play with limited downside, depending on when you purchase your options. The inclusion announcement is on Friday after hours, so you could buy Friday before close or anytime this week and sell Monday morning if its not included for a minimum loss. And with options being so cheap, this could be a 50-bagger if it goes to 30 bucks. 6/21 23 C 6/21 25 C.",0.5557,POSITIVE,0.7174

How Terrifying is the Start of August.csv,"Just over the past three trading days, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 indices have all recorded their largest three-day cumulative decline since June 2022! Last night, the Nasdaq plummeted by over 6% at one point, and the S&P 500 dropped by more than 4%, with both indices returning to their early May levels by the close of trading. Although the major U.S. indices and individual stocks still closed with significant losses, the intraday declines were somewhat moderated. The primary reason for this was the release of the U.S. July ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, which rebounded from a four-year low in June to 51.4, exceeding market expectations and returning to the expansion zone above 50! Sub-indices, including the New Orders Index and Employment Index, also showed growth. Notably, the Employment Index reached 51.1, marking the largest increase since September of last year and the first time this year that it has entered the expansion zone above 50. This data slightly alleviated fears from last week's significant non-farm payroll decline, making the market believe that the drop in new jobs was primarily due to Hurricane Barry hitting Texas. 👉 As discussed previously, the sharp decline in U.S. stocks at the start of August stemmed from worries about the U.S. economy falling into recession. Therefore, when the ISM Non-Manufacturing number showed growth yesterday, it somewhat restored market confidence in the economy, helping to narrow the intraday losses of U.S. stocks. The U.S. stock market now needs to see positive economic growth news to recover, unlike before when everyone was hoping for bad news, anticipating a Federal Reserve interest rate cut! Hence, it is crucial to continue monitoring other economic data. If strong and robust growth numbers do not consistently appear, investors will remain concerned about an economic recession, and the trend of selling stocks for cash will not end. The VIX Fear Index is a crucial indicator to observe market sentiment calming down.

I wait all year for this opportunity - now I'm going to share it with you.csv,"If you trade long enough, you begin to see patterns emerge. On October 30th, one of my favorite patterns is starting. If you buy AMD stock on the last Monday of October, the average return for the rest of the year is 24.52%, and the stock is higher 88.89% of the time. This data starts in 2015 because it is the first full year after Dr. Lisa Su became CEO of AMD. Some of you may be wondering why this period is so strong for AMD stock. Let me share my personal theory. AMD depends on TSMC for chip manufacturing. Taiwan is protected by its geography and weather, but the Chinese have two windows of opportunity to cross the Strait with favorable weather. The first is from late March to the end of April. The second is from late September to late October. Last year, China launched major military exercises around Taiwan in April. This year, they did it in October, which just ended a few days ago. (They also launch these exercises when they are provoked, such as when Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan or during the recent Taiwanese elections.) In my view, the end of October triggers a relief rally in stocks related to TSMC, most notably AMD and Nvidia. This combines with earnings and strong seasonality, resulting in massive outperformance in a relatively short period of time. A quick word of warning—this time period includes earnings. If you want to avoid earnings risk, you can wait until the first Monday of November. If you wait until November, the average return is 19.06%, and the stock is higher 77.78% of the time by the end of the year.

Why Intel Could Be the Game-Changer? Intel (INTC) is uniquely positioned to disrupt NVIDIA's monopoly. Alongside AMD, Intel possesses the expertise and resources needed to engineer AI chips. Enter Gaudi 3. If Gaudi 3 lives up to the hype, Intel’s stock could potentially skyrocket, doubling in value in a matter of months hands down. Government Backing: The U.S. government and major institutions are already showing their support for Intel, recognizing its strategic importance in the tech race. Positive Vibes: Reviews for Intel's Arrow Lake architecture are rolling in with strong positives, indicating that Intel's on the right track to regain dominance. Diamond Hands Ready: This isn't just a strategy; it’s a calculated move anticipating a shift in the tech landscape. Intel could lead the next wave of AI innovation.

INTC - A dumb person's retrospective.csv,"I'm lazy and you regards don't like to read so I'll leave it to bullet points and you can piece them together. Intel was seen as a bargain in 2023 compared to NVDA and AMD after their 400% run up. US gov have vested interest in Intel. No they are not propping Intel up, but it's effectively giving Intel a big loan to buy a second house. That loan can pay off if the housing market goes up, or they are double fucked because they leveraged to buy a second house. If you bought Intel because china will invade Taiwan, you are really regarded. If China invades Taiwan, everything is going to sell. That's a disruption of global trade on WW2 levels. Your best case scenario still loses you money. Intel bullish scenario is 18A, High-Na EUV paying dividends, early experience granting them a year technological lead over TSMC. It doesn't have to work, but the upside is a 10x from these levels. TSMC pass up High NA EUV is repeating the same decision Intel did in 2012 when Intel controlled the market and did not view EUV as economically feasible. Again, doesn't mean TSMC is incorrect in their assessment, but history does repeat itself. Intel bearish scenario is just repeat of 2016 and delay after delay. In which case they head to legacy company status like Ford. Anyone else remember all the Ford bulls in 2016? They're not on this sub anymore because they all went broke. I'm no crayon guy.

The investment only somewhat paid off in 2018 when AMD traded to 30, but then half the regards lost everything (myself included) when it crashed to 18 in 2 months following Powell's rate hike. Look how quickly sentiment changed for AMD from 2018. This very well could be history repeating itself, as the semiconductor companies have demonstrated over and over again. Intel 18A is a repeat situation of AMD ZEN. The upside cannot be understated. I'm still bullish. Proper execution can bring the company to a $200+ stock.

Intel - Pinnacle of failure.csv,"Intel's Slippery Slope: Financial Woes, Investor Distrust, and Leadership Issues Intel Corporation, once a dominant force in the tech industry, is now grappling with a series of significant challenges that have fueled a troubling decline. Despite attempts to project a positive outlook, the company’s current trajectory suggests a troubling downward spiral. Financial Performance and Market Challenges Intel's financial performance has continued to deteriorate. For the first half of 2024, Intel reported revenues of $24 billion, marking a slight decrease compared to previous periods. This decline is occurring amid a broader tech sector recovery and highlights Intel’s struggle to maintain its competitive edge. The company's net income for this period was a mere $800 million, translating to a profit margin of approximately 3.3%, indicating substantial operational inefficiencies and intense competition from rivals such as AMD and NVIDIA. Declining Customer Satisfaction and Product Concerns Customer dissatisfaction remains a critical issue. The release of Intel's 14th Gen Core processors has not addressed the performance inconsistencies that plagued previous models. While the company has introduced new features, reviews suggest that these updates have not significantly improved reliability or performance compared to competitors. This ongoing issue is eroding customer trust and impacting market share. Eroding Investor Confidence Investor confidence in Intel is faltering. The recent involvement of Apollo Global Management has raised concerns, particularly following Apollo’s controversial investment decisions in other sectors. Additionally, a recent lawsuit filed by major institutional investors alleges mismanagement and failure to deliver on key performance promises. This legal battle has further shaken confidence, prompting several large investors to divest from Intel, exacerbating the company's financial strain. Leadership and Legal Troubles Intel's leadership is facing intense scrutiny. Recent high-profile exits, including the departure of several senior executives, have led to a perception of instability at the top. The company's reliance on legal strategies to address its challenges, rather than focusing on operational and strategic improvements, appears to be aggravatinh its difficulties. This reactive approach is not addressing the underlying issues affecting Intel’s performance. Future Prospects and Potential Downturn Intel’s future prospects remain uncertain. Despite a significant $15 billion R&D budget, the company’s progress in key areas like AI and autonomous driving lags behind that of its more agile competitors. Moreover, while short-term production issues in Taiwan have provided some temporary relief, these are unlikely to reverse the long-term downward trend. The competitive landscape continues to evolve rapidly, and Intel’s slower adaptation could hinder its recovery prospects. TL;DR Intel’s current strategy, which includes overhauling its product lineup and executive team, appears to be a desperate attempt to stabilize its position. For investors and stakeholders, the warning signs are clear: Intel’s challenges are substantial, and the company’s efforts to turn things around may not be sufficient in the face of ongoing and evolving issues.

Intel is a good buy.csv,"We are all well aware Intel is having it's own Boeing moment right now with design flaws in their CPUs and horrible customer service. They deserve the steaming pile dooky that is currently sitting atop their share value. That being said, they have an ace that may flip the entire market on it's head: They own their fabs. That's right: all the other big boys in town design and give their blueprints for TSMC to manufacture. That's true of AMD, Nvidia, and other ARM and mobile chip designers. Intel is the only large scale chip designers that is more or less vertically integrated. As you may know, they just got $8.8B from papa Biden to build more foundries in Ohio and Arizona, in addition to their other sites across the world. None of this is particularly noteworthy until you consider that China has always been very interested in Chinesing Taiwan, and are even more so now that they have been embargoed from Nvidia chips by the US. The Chinese military build-up over the past decade has focused heavily on amphibious warfare, and long range anti-naval weapons (think carrier buster ballistic/boost-glide stand off weapons.) It doesn't take a Ph.D in geopolitics to understand what the move is here. On the US/allied side, the discourse around Taiwan has slowly shifted: what started out as ""we have overwhelming force and we will stop any attempt at an invasion of Taiwan"" has become something like ""Maybe we can't stop them from invading, but we can make it a Pyrrhic victory"". This may actually be the case, but the trend is not great. You will have noticed Taiwan has been increasingly politically isolated, mirroring the growing Chinese military power in the region. So what happens to TSMC if Taiwan gets Chinesed? As you can imagine, China is interested in acquiring as many TSMC assets and personnel intact as possible. This means you can bet your degenerate bacon that US intelligence services have contingencies to extradite key scientists and engineers, and scuttle the production plants and machines before the Chinese can take control of them. But the result is easy to predict: no more TSMC. This means the personnel extradited will be used to advise and run US production plants owned by, you guessed it: Intel. Intel will have a quasi monopoly on chip manufacturing. The US government see this of course, that's why they are strongly nudging Nvidia to play nice with Intel, because they see a potential future where Intel is the only player in town capable of making Nvidia chips, or any consumer chips at all for that matter, in the West.

Intel is a pretty safe bet and are undervalued.csv,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs. An additional benefit is that Intel can leverage their fabs in order to achieve higher margins for their own products. It's possible Intel's stock could be hit again in a month or so when their report comes out, but they are likely already at bottom.",0.5493,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Is INTC undervalued .csv,"Valuation Analysis of Intel Corporation Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has long been a key player in the semiconductor industry, but recent market developments and the rise of competitors like AMD and Nvidia have caused its stock to significantly underperform relative to its peers. As of Q2 2024, Intel’s total assets amount to approximately $182 billion, with liabilities around $91 billion, resulting in a net asset value of $91 billion. Yet, its market capitalization is around $95 billion, reflecting an almost 1:1 ratio between market cap and net assets. In contrast, competitors such as AMD and Nvidia trade at significantly higher premiums, indicating that the market may be underpricing Intel’s growth potential. Company Market Cap (Billion $) Net Assets (Billion $) Price to Net Asset Ratio Intel 95 91 1.04 AMD 266 56.5 4.71 Nvidia 3,000 58.15 51.58 Understanding Intel’s Valuation The Price to Net Asset Ratio (P/NAV) is a critical measure of how the market values a company relative to its net assets. Intel's current P/NAV of 1.04 reveals that its market value is nearly identical to its net assets, a valuation that appears surprisingly low, particularly when compared to its competitors. AMD and Nvidia, for instance, demonstrate P/NAV ratios of 4.71 and 51.58, respectively. This significant gap highlights the possibility that Intel is undervalued, especially given its strong fundamentals and growth potential. Several factors support this assessment. Despite facing fierce competition, Intel remains a leader in the semiconductor industry, known for its quality and innovation. The company is making substantial investments in new technologies and manufacturing capabilities, positioning itself to capitalize on growing trends such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, Intel boasts a robust balance sheet, with total assets of about $182 billion and liabilities around $91 billion. This financial strength provides a solid foundation for future growth and strategic initiatives. Although the recent decision to lay off 15,000 employees might seem concerning, it is part of a broader strategy to enhance operational efficiency and focus on core competencies, enabling Intel to adapt more effectively to evolving market demands. A key factor influencing Intel's future is the increasing global demand for semiconductors. As technology becomes more integrated into daily life, the need for high-performance chips continues to rise. Intel's resources and commitment to innovation position it to capture a larger share of this expanding market. Moreover, government support for the semiconductor industry adds another layer of potential upside for Intel. Given the strategic importance of semiconductor manufacturing in light of global supply chain challenges, particularly concerning the Taiwan-China situation, there is growing interest from government entities to bolster domestic semiconductor production. This focus on strengthening local supply chains can create favorable conditions for Intel, as it could receive both financial incentives and regulatory support to expand its operations and enhance its competitive positioning. Conclusion In summary, Intel Corporation is significantly undervalued based on its current P/NAV ratio. The company possesses strong assets, a history of innovation, and a strategic focus on future technologies. As Intel continues to execute its strategic plans and navigate market challenges, it has substantial potential to regain its competitive edge and achieve remarkable growth. Furthermore, the increasing government interest in supporting semiconductor manufacturing amid geopolitical uncertainties enhances Intel's prospects. The market's current valuation does not adequately reflect Intel's true value and growth potential, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

Long-time AMD Holder (Cost Basis 1904) Starting to Sell - Anyone Else Disappointed in the Stock in 2.csv,"Wrote about my thinking below... Out of the 31 large banks, 25 have a “buy” rating and 6 have a “hold” rating on AMD 0.29%↑. It’s hard to think about why to sell when everyone is telling you to buy, but I am of the opinion that is when it should be most deeply considered. image credit to tipranks.com AMD has been my most profitable investment of the past 5 years, having risen 800% since purchased in August of 2018. For most investors (including myself), it’s difficult to part with winners. Not only that, I am someone who believes AI will proliferate throughout society in the coming years. Because they design data center GPUs, AMD should be one of the primary beneficiaries as the AI boom continues. It might seem counter-intuitive then to sell the stock here, but that is what I’ve begun doing over the past two weeks. I had high hopes for AMD this year, but it’s my view that they've failed to take significant data center GPU market share from Nvidia, and will have increased competition from Intel's new product offerings (on both client and data center), as well as proprietary silicon from large cloud players (Google, Amazon, etc). My original thesis was that AMD would profit from overextended Nvidia margins in 2024, but this underestimated the CUDA ecosystem moat that existed with Nvidia data center products (see Why I Got Nvidia Wrong). While most large cloud players want to diversify at least somewhat from Nvidia, they are still unable to do so without risking a competitive advantage with their own AI offerings. Add Intel into the mix, and the margin and market share pressure will be on AMD. The only player in the silicon value chain I think which can currently raise margins is TSMC (TSM 2.61%↑), but the geopolitical risk is too high for me to continue holding the stock (I sold my TSMC stake two weeks ago). On the PC (personal computer), Nvidia has always had a strong moat. It’s not just because they have the best performing products, but also because game developers are economically incentivized to optimize first (and often only) for the largest potential audience. This is similar to the moat CUDA protects on the data center side. One might think that Nvidia charging incredibly high prices for discrete graphics cards would cause them to lose share to AMD with consumers who directly purchase the products (as opposed to businesses who purchase the data center products). Yet Nvidia market share has only grown over the past few years. Data from Jon Peddie Research Why This Take Could Be Wrong: There is a lot of bullish momentum in the investor community around AMD currently from both professional commentators and retail investors (e.g. Twitter / X). Many people who had never heard of AMD 5 years ago are now saying to put money into the stock as it is Nvidia’s only pure AI competitor. As a result of this, AMD could see a dramatic rise on a positive earnings report later this month. In addition, I expect gaming revenues to surprise to the upside with the minor refresh of Xbox and Playstation consoles coming for holiday season. I still have ~260 shares of AMD remaining, and will likely hold to see if the stock jumps on the report. I think that AMD is extremely stretched in its current valuation (P/E of 205), and that any bad news could send it spiralling. Selling half of the remaining stake now is essentially a hedge against this possibility. Whatever happens with the earnings report, I will likely reduce my AMD holdings to zero in the next few months as I continue to lower exposure to companies reliant on Taiwan.",0.5591,NEGATIVE,0.9976

Wells Fargo ($WFC) must face a lawsuit over sham job interviews Rate Cut Countdown — Will the Fed Finally Pull the Trigger? Nope, the Fed isn’t cutting rates this week. But don’t snooze just yet—this meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn’t overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy—he's searching for that ""just right"" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same. Inflation: Cooling Off Inflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year’s 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the ""last mile"" of inflation reduction. The message? We’re on the right track, folks. Unemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it’s taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell’s recent take? The labor market isn’t adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a “sweet spot”—balancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals. Risk Management Reboot With inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed’s risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle—slightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed’s past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they’re determined to act promptly to avoid a recession. Some Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it’s time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn’t seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first. The Fed’s balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31. McDonald’s: The Golden Arches Stumble By the Numbers Revenue: $6.49 billion (missed $6.61 billion estimate) Earnings per Share: $2.97 (missed $3.07 estimate) Same-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020) U.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7% International Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1% International Franchised Sales: Down 1.3% McDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening. Value Meals to the Rescue The fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn’t translated into higher overall sales just yet. Internationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk. Defying the Odds Announcing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away. Despite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a ""buy"" and none recommending a sell. Looking Forward The golden arches are taking a ""forensic approach"" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales. So, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future. On The Horizon Tomorrow Economic Data and Earnings This week is buzzing with key economic data, especially on the employment front. Tomorrow, we'll get the June JOLTS report, which stands for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. This report measures job openings, hirings, and separations (like firings and retirements), offering a detailed snapshot of the U.S. job market. The May report surprised everyone with an unexpected increase in job openings, suggesting a stronger labor market. This might just be the signal the Fed needs to consider rate cuts sooner than expected. Earnings season is heating up, and the first of the Magnificent Seven stocks reports tomorrow after the close.

However, Corning’s traditionally steady growth might not match these high expectations. If management doesn’t deliver impressive forecasts, a selloff could be on the horizon. Analysts are expecting $0.46 EPS and $3.54 billion in revenue. Paypal ($PYPL) faced a setback when Apple introduced a competing payment service in June. Nonetheless, PayPal remains robust, thanks to its strong e-commerce presence, Venmo's popularity, and its new checkout system, Fastlane. Optimistic shareholders are hoping for an earnings beat.

Microsoft’s Cloud Rain on Earnings Parade In a classic case of “so close, yet so far,” Microsoft ($MSFT) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, only to see its stock plummet over 5.79% in after-hours trading. Why? Investors fixated on the company’s disappointing Azure cloud revenue. Earnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints Microsoft’s revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure’s performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue—just shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub’s impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn’t enough to quell investor concerns. By the Numbers Revenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected Market Reaction and Future Outlook While the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft’s other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure’s growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn’t enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft’s shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500’s 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market’s laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters. Chips Ahoy! AMD’s Data Center Sales Surge 115% AMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let’s break it down. Earnings Breakdown AMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street’s expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter AI Chips and Data Center Dominance The tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company’s overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast. Other Segments and Market Reaction While the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD’s business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year AMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high. On The Horizon Tomorrow’s labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let’s be honest, they’re all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week’s job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes. Before Market Open Boeing ($BA): Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels. Expected: $3.51 EPS, $6.85 billion in revenue. Marriott International ($MAR) : The hospitality giant thrived post-pandemic with revenge spending, but the travel boom is slowing.

After Market Close Meta Platforms ($META): Next up in the Mag 7 parade, Meta’s spending spree on AI, including the new Llama 3.1 model, is under the microscope. The focus will be on how these investments impact cash flow and margins. Expected: $4.72 EPS, $38.30 billion in revenue. Arm Holdings ($ARM): With a staggering 94% rise in 2024, Arm’s valuation is in question. Shareholders are keen to see continued strong demand for semiconductors without sacrificing margins.

My Analysis on ARM Holdings 2 Trillion+ Valuation.csv,"I believe ARM Holdings is slept on! I believe it could be the next NVIDIA. As of this writing its Market Cap is sitting at $142.36 Billion. I believe that its market cap should be ATLEAST 1 trillion due to the fact that it has an enormous market share of damn near if not more of 95% of the worlds smart device chips. What makes ARM unique is its business model. Their primary source of revenue is from the leasing of the design of the instruction set of computer chips. For those who dont know the instruction set is often referred to as an instruction set architecture (ISA), is a group of commands for a CPU in machine language. These commands tell the processor what operations to perform. Each instruction in the set specifies a particular operation to be performed on a specified set of data operands. The instruction set is fundamental to the design and functionality of computer chips, dictating how software communicates with hardware... So what is unique about this? Well I will tell you, these instruction sets are incredibly energy effecient compared to what is used currently for AI such as RISC or X86 etc. Currently NVIDIA is soaring because of the AI craze and its success has put light onto AMD, INTEL, SMCI etc but I believe ARM is a sleeper in my opinion. Their main source on revenue is through the royalties it recieves for leasing its designs. They can easily raise the royalty rate to increase their revenue stream anytime but there are some downsides. There customers could leave them and use other options. I dont think that is going to happen because lets face it their intellectual property is far better than any of the competition in terms of effeciency. AI is growing rapidly and one key expense is going to be energy consumption. Especially in these data centers. To my knowledge most data centers run on chips that use x86 from Intel. Those chips using that instruction set uses alot of energy. I believe data centers are looking to convert to a more energy effecient chip and when they do.... ENTER: ARM. Arm is currently used in almost all smart devices because again they are energy effecient. Why do we have longer battery life in a smart phones? Its because of ARM. What chips do electric cars use? ARM what instruction set does your microwave, fridge, washing machine use? ARM. Currently ARM is all over the portable device market but once they hit the data centers I believe there revenue is going to explode and therefore the market cap. There are major catalysts going down right now such as Microsoft partnering with them to make ARM based laptops and NVIDIA collaborating with them to make computers, not to mention that Tesla ordered a ton of NVIDIA chips that use ARM architecture. But my most bullish thing about ARM is what Jensen Huang said at Computex. He said that AI will eventually become physical in terms of robotics. Do you think those robotics need a energy sucker of a computerchip instruction set? No, the need the most energy effecient tech in todays age and that where ARM steps up right again. Currently we only use AI remotely (Chat GPT, Picture Generators, Etc.) but once we put AI into something physical and tangible such as robots to do everyday tasks those devices and robots need to run on the most advance and effecient software. I am currently looking at an outlook of 5-15 years and I am long on my position is this stock. We all seen what nvidia did and can only imagine what the next stock can yield the same returns and I think its ARM Holdings. Imagine going back to 2017 and investing into NVIDIA when the markect cap was the same as ARM now. Those returns look nice right if you have invested then. The time is now. Please keep in mind that i have not decided to go completely in depth of all of my research on ARM Holdings so please do your own. Also, I purposefully did not go into fundementals such as earnings and revenue on this. This is just my personal long term outlook on the research I have done. There are plenty more catalysts and risks out there so please DYOR. Feel free to comment!",0.5404,POSITIVE,0.9991

My outlook on markets going forward - from a dear regard.csv,"January 2024: market starts to price in anticipated 4-5 rate cuts in 2024. Tech moons. Small/Mid caps stagnant. for the first quarter you could make bank - i made 30k through march and withdrew that shit to pay for my kids school. April 2024: I am now a reformed bear continuing bull strategy from the first 6 weeks: S*P drop 5.4% through April 19 - higher than expected inflation date. Push rates higher, lower # of anticipated rate cuts. I got hammered trying the same call strategy. Gave away 15k if not more. May 2024: AI AI AI every time you say AI in your earnings call the price goes up $1. S&P up 5.96% June 2024: News Report: tech doesn't even need a rate cut to continue the bull run. June 12 $AAPL says ""APPLE INTELLIGENCE"", reaches all time highs. (puts for their earnings btw). $NVDA 140% for the year? After last year we were like WTF how is this 300 a share let alone 1400 a share in June. July 2024 $GOOG $AMZN up ~80-100% for the year. Look, its logical to take profits. No shame in that especially for retail who loses out 90% of the time. July 2024: Rate cuts like 99.999% almost certain for sept. Now suddenly Small/Mid caps rally in a massive sector rotation. $SPX/$NDX tanks. Next week: 1T outflows. Then they pump and dump the russel up 12% to 2022 highs and then sell off for a quick 6% while everyones FOMOing into $RUT. Maybe more like RUT RO!!!! I Fomo'd last of dry powder MOnday but after earnings I'm turning bearish. Tomorrow 5k realized loss for me or hold to 0. Too hard to beat the street. Profit taking, buying million dollar real estate with cash like smart investors do. Sit on the sidelines and let it bleed. But here we are still FOMO'ing calls and short dated puts that would only print 1/1000 times. Over the past few days 3 mag 7 earnings all tanked and here we are. AMD? CPUs Good for gamers and graphics cards for poors. Pennies compared to $NVDA. $NVDA has a monopoly on AI software like $ASML has a monopoly on lithography and $TSM has a monopoly on chip production. $TSLA obviously seemingly doomed. Google can't take your cookies anymore, advertising revenue down MoM. Wanna get cucked by the zuck? I'm tempted to donate $1 to people wanting to buy $META calls at this point. TLDR: This looks like the same pattern we have had in 2022 and 2023 when markets take a downturn through mid-late October. Look at the previous years.

My thesis on INTC going into 2025.csv,"I am going to add my technological and geopolitical fundamentals here, because I think these are going to be important factors heading into 2025. Disclaimer: I own 575 shares of Intel at an average PpS of $29.30 I think most analysts are forgetting that the next president is the same guy who is trying to block the acquisition of US steel by Nippon steel at all costs, regardless if it makes financial sense or not because he wants to retain as much American Manufacturing as possible and wants it to succeed. Most of the ""AI revolution"" has happened over the past 4 years where the administration had no problem letting foreign chip manufacturing take the lead. Intel is competing with TSMC, and TSMC receives massive subsidies and discounts from the Taiwanese government which dwarf the 7.9B (which was even reduced) from the US government. On top of that, the US government is also giving slightly less in subsidies, 6.6B, to TSMC to build in the US. So really, the current administration is not giving Intel an advantage over TSMC. The most effective thing that they could do is levy tariffs against Taiwan, which the next president has gone on record stating he wishes to do, instead of subsidies. This would increase demand for American chip manufacturing; while TSMC can manufacture in the US, CoWoS packaging is done outside of the US, in either Malaysia or Taiwan, and would cause the product to be subject to tariffs. In the chip design space, Intel is hopelessly behind on GPUs compared to Nvidia, and now Apple, Amazon, OpenAI and others are designing their own chips and using TSMC for manufacture. Intel still dominates the CPU space, but your average datacenter rack might have 10/20+ GPUs for each CPU. AMD is also a viable alternative to Intel for CPUs, and as such takes about 25% of the market. Intel's only way to compete in the GPU space is in the cost performance market, which mainly targets budget gaming, crypto mining, and cheap datacenter. The newest release of the ""Battlemage"" B580 is expected to compete with Nvidia's 4060 at the under $300 MSRP market, which are lofty goals. Nvidia and AMD still have offerings in these spaces but they are not lucrative ones. So Intel is basically competing to be a 3rd rate designer in the US, while they still have the CPU lead it matters a lot less for the lucrative markets right now. It's clear that on the design front, Intel is not going to receive much help to be successful. While this is their core business and majority of revenue, it is a business they are falling behind substantially compared to others. Design demand is GPUs and they are late to this party. Revenue for products is expected to stagnate or decline unless they have a competitive GPU offering. However, the US needs to have a domestic cutting edge chip manufacturing supply chain. It has expressed as much as a result of the 2022 supply chain shortage when we realized that letting TSMC manufacture 90% of the world's sub 5nm chips was a bad idea. That was the motivation behind passing the CHIPS act; Pat Gelsinger was instrumental in advising the current administration for this. The method for doing so has left a lot to be desired; Pat himself even expressed as much given the delay in fund disbursement, which in all fairness was only accelerated as a result of the election result and comments from republicans that they wanted to repeal the act. TSMC is not allowed to have the latest node fabricated in the US by law of the Taiwanese government. This is so that the country keeps its ""Silicon Shield"", the dependence globally to have manufacturing be done there which keeps Taiwan protected from China. But Intel has no such limitation. And TSMC is not able to fufill 100% of the orders for its customers; it is aggressively building more fabs to keep up with the ever increasing demand of AI. This demand exists for Intel to take part of. So, Intel in the next administration will have a tremendous amount of support for its Foundry, not Products, side of the business. This leaves Intel with a potential alternative to many of the scenarios analysts predict: It could solely dedicate to Foundry and sell off its Products division, most likely to AMD which shares the x86 architecture already and is solely focused on design. This would allow Intel to become a Foundry for external customers without having a conflict of interest, which I suspect is keeping them from customers. The CHIPS act stipulates that Intel has to retain a majority stake of Foundry but NOT Products, so this does not prevent Intel from dedicating itself to Foundry, which is what the US wants. I think Pat was waiting for the right climate to do this and it is coming soon. It is sad he did not stay long enough to see it happen. If Intel received the same amount of support from the US government that the Taiwanese government gave to TSMC, and was able to win external customers as a result of Tariffs, it could become the US TSMC. Much of this hinges on the 18A and later 14A nodes which are competitive with TSMC 2nm, which is the current cutting edge. But I think this is the desire of Intel and the next administration, and so they will work towards this goal. To diminish foundry would be a slow death for Intel. That is why I am still looking forward to Intel in 2025. If you got this far, thank you for reading. EDIT: Now that I think about it, it is also entirely possible for Qualcomm to buy Intel's Products division. I think they expressed as much earlier this year, but being they are primarily ARM I am not sure if it would be a good fit.",0.5359,NEGATIVE,0.9956
My views on why NVDA beats earnings and flies to higher supports Likley past 200.csv,"For the PE bitchers and moaners, I leave you this: AMD Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 126 NVDA Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 69 Chanos bitched and moaned all the way to the broke house where he had to close shop.

Market is expecting a healthy stable growth, now that we are near equilibrium with AI and chips, ( this is obviously not true, but it's the arguments bears try to hang on. They think Amazon will overtake a 30 year CUDA industry software environment the entire world/industry has created THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AROUND). Go look up CUDA. It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four...

NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming Latest Sept 2025, with my guess, Jensen starts marketing from first half of 2025, and wider release commercially of NVDA CPU for 1st qtr of 2026, March, me thinks Jensen starts getting market ready all of 2025 for release in the wild September 2025 for retail user and full wider release by March 2026 / end of February 2026. Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?.. I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about.

Nearly every other chip designer abandoned fabs because businesses operate best when they focus on what they do best. Intel is unique in that it is set up to transform the business into a major foundry model going forward. That takes decades of investment which Intel is ahead on.

NVDA has been all the rage and justifiably so.csv,"Since NVDA reporter its Q1 2023 earnings, revealing huge demand for AI chips, the stock has surged to $3.3T. Revenues 4x, margins up expanded and everything seemed perfect. Bulls claimed the stock was getting cheaper to decelerating growth. Quarterly revenue growth has dropped from 88% to 34% to 18%, heading towards single digits. Next quarter we’ll see just 7%. All of the marginal buyers are in — sucking the last few retail buyers in with the lure of a split. History suggests short term bump after a split as we are seeing, but now institutional investors have a vast pool to distribute their shares in coming months. As the saying goes, “when the ducks are quacking, feed them.” If the quarterly revenue growth continues to moderate, earnings growth will be impacted as well — making the stock become more and more “expensive” (multiple screams higher) versus the theme of last year when the higher it climbed the “cheaper” it got. This does not change the fact that it is a great business with a great leader — which will play a role in the advance of AI technologies and productivity. It’s just going to be a heavy lift that it retains a perception of greater value than Amazon, Microsoft or the entire German Stock Market Capitalizations (where it trades now). NVDA is still a semiconductor company, which has never been a secular business — it’s cyclical. Always has been, always will be. As for 70% gross margins, as Bezos famously said, “your margin is my opportunity.” NVDA has not cured cancer. There will be more and more competition going forward. Intel’s Gaudi 3 is 50% faster than NVDA’s H100 and 40% more energy efficient. AMD is gunning for them.

We'll be bringing that late next year when Falcon Shores, when we combine the great systolic performance of Gaudi 3 with a fully programmable architecture and all of that comes together with Falcon Shores. And then we have a rich, a very aggressive cadence of Falcon Shores products following that. We also added the Gaudi 3 PC IE card to it, this use case of Xeon plus an accelerator or Gaudi accelerator is getting very good response from customers as well. So we'll be bringing that out later this year. But the real story is delivering the TCO value, delivering the enterprise use cases. On Falcon Shores, we'll just build on the momentum that we're establishing with Gaudi 2 and 3.

"NVDA will hit 5T market cap in 2026, and 10T market cap before 2032.csv","Hi regards, This is not a ""copium"" post about the recent stock price drops. I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest. The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY. First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"". Name Stock price EPS SP/EPS ratio AAPL 230 1,4 164 MSFT 413 2,95 140 AMD 145 0,16 1.035 META 516 5,16 100 AMZN 171 1,26 135 NVDA 116 0,68 170 As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price. But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list. AAPL Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits. How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new. But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more. MSFT They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are. They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy. They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office? AMD I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first. Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware. Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software. And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section. META They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value. ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS. AMZN The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL. NVDA AND OUR STAR CHILD. HOT TOPIC OF 2024. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company. Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?

You can't have this kind of transformation without people getting overexcited for a few years. But we aren't at that stage yet. Look at how long the dotcom bubble took, and more importantly, look how the late stage was characterized - explosion of IPOs. Until we get a flood of IPOs, we aren't in the late stage. Until we see an IPO for SexRobots Inc, we aren't in the late stage. At the moment we've got a handful of companies beating expectations because of AI revenue (good for Nvidia, long-term), and some beating CapEx expectations because of AI spending (good for Nvidia, short-term) The current situation Look at Nvidia P/E compared to its share price. We're halfway through the year. At the end of this fiscal year, Nvidia will be worth $180 at the midline of this trend. It is currently $113. That is a 57% return, 157% on an annualized basis. Nvidia is down 17% from its peak. Its hard to call the bottom, but yesterday we saw a major flash crash followed by a v back up. Much like the opposite of the ""blow-off"" tops that we see when the bull runs peak. Big volume selling, big volume buying. Big down, big up. I expect the fast bears used that to get out. The slow ones will watch their profits start eroding before also bailing and taking their gains. The slower ones will hit their stop losses, and the slowest will drift back into the red. If you're a bear in the green, take the W and get out Upcoming catalysts Other company earnings next week - MSFT, META, SNAP, AMD, ARM Upcoming earnings What are the market expectations for next earnings? They say they are expecting $0.59 per share. But last quarter Nvidia made that, on the back of 26B in revenue. For this quarter, Nvidia predicted 28B revenue.

NVIDIA (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang Points to 1 Trillion Opportunity for the Company.csv,"Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the next few weeks until the US election would be “confusing” for many since no one could say anything with conviction about who is going to be in the White House. Lee said that the market is going to trade “well” into the upcoming Fed meeting where he expects “some” rate cuts amid the labor market needing support and positive inflation data. Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said: However, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive. For this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that a trillion dollars’ worth of general-purpose data centers will inevitably transition to accelerated computing. “We’re in a computer revolution,” Huang said, pointing out that the first wave of data center modernization is driven by generative AI, which he described as more than just a tool—it’s a skill. Huang also emphasized the need for “densification,” with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) aiming to make data centers more efficient by compressing them into smaller spaces. He discussed NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it. Nvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia. Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave. At Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range. Of course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.

Nvidia The only problem you're gonna have is that you didn't sell more.csv,"Introduction Alright, so Nvidia is crazy overvalued right now. Just check out its P/E ratio – it's sitting at a whopping 73.94. And that's not all. Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.55, and the price-to-sales ratio is over 42. These numbers are way above what you typically see for tech stocks and the semiconductor industry. There are two big reasons why Nvidia's stock might take a hit: growing competition and lowered margins. Growing Competition First off, the competition is heating up big time. 🔥 AMD's MI300 series is a beast, merging CPU and GPU on the same chip, which is great for performance and energy efficiency. This is super important for data centers and AI applications, and it could seriously cut into Nvidia's market share. AMD is coming in hot, and Nvidia might end up feeling the burn. Then you've got Intel with their Gaudi3 GPU, which is packing some serious performance and efficiency for AI and machine learning tasks. More people might start switching to Intel's GPUs, giving Nvidia a run for its money. Intel's Gaudi3 could be the ghost in Nvidia's machine👻 Lowered Margins Then there's Amazon, which is throwing its hat into the ring with custom GPUs for their EC2 instances. These GPUs are optimized for machine learning and AI, and they integrate perfectly with Amazon's cloud services. This seamless integration could mean less reliance on Nvidia's products, pushing Nvidia to cut prices to stay competitive. Lower prices mean lower margins, which isn't great for Nvidia's bottom line. Amazon could very well turn Nvidia's margins into margin call memes. 📉 Adding to the heat, TSMC is thinking about jacking up production fees for Nvidia. The chairman's plans to raise prices could eat away at Nvidia's margins even more. If TSMC hikes those fees, Nvidia might have to dig deeper into their pockets, and that could be a real pain in the margins. 💸 Link (06/04) So yeah, Nvidia's stock might be flying high right now, but with all this competition and pressure on margins, it might not stay that way for long. It's looking like Nvidia might be headed from tendies to tears if they can't keep up. 😂 TL;DR Nvidia is trading high, but AMD, Intel, and Amazon are bringing the heat. 🔥 Competition + TSMC price hikes = potential margin squeeze. Stock might go from 🚀 to 💥 if they don't keep up. 😂",0.5456,NEGATIVE,0.9812
Nvidia's Blackwell Delay Offers Investors A Chance To 'Add To Positions' says Goldman Sachs.csv,"Nvidia Corp (NVDA) finds itself at the center of tech speculation as reports have surfaced about potential delays in its much-anticipated Blackwell architecture. With tech giants like Nvidia often facing the heat of public and market scrutiny, the slightest hiccup can stir investor unease. But is this delay really a cause for concern, or just a blip on Nvidia’s otherwise smooth journey towards AI supremacy? According to a report by The Information, Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell chips might hit a speed bump, delaying their release by over three months due to alleged design flaws. These chips were set to ship later this year, boasting promises of up to 30x better Inference performance over their predecessors. Despite this setback, Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs advises investors to remain calm and continue with their current strategies. The delay, while not ideal, is unlikely to impact Nvidia's 2025 earnings power or its market dominance, according to Hari. “We expect there to be little to no impact on CY2025 earnings and, most importantly, the company's long-term competitive position.” Hari believes that any short-term volatility in Nvidia's fundamentals will be just that—short-lived. The Market Reaction: Opportunity or Overreaction? For those ready to jump ship, Hari's advice is clear: stay the course. Nvidia's stock might experience some turbulence, but the company’s strong footing in the AI market isn't going anywhere. “We would consider any near-term dislocation in the stock as an opportunity to add to positions.” Despite a recent 15% correction, Nvidia remains a top pick, firmly seated on Goldman's Americas Conviction List with a 12-month price target of $135, suggesting a potential upside of nearly 26%. Even with Blackwell’s reported delays, Nvidia’s projected 39% year-over-year growth in 2025 remains unchanged. Hari’s bullish stance is rooted in Nvidia’s role as a crucial player in the rapidly evolving AI sector, especially as the demand for advanced AI infrastructure shows no signs of slowing down. Implications for Rival – AMD Interestingly, while the Blackwell delays might appear as a dark cloud over Nvidia, there could be a silver lining for competitors like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (AMD). “We believe the market could perceive this development as a marginal positive for AMD — the only alternative to Nvidia today in Data Center GPUs.” Although the analysts say AMD is unlikely to overtake Nvidia due to Nvidia’s strong market position and AMD’s challenges in scaling operations, this situation could still present a competitive boost for AMD. What’s Next for Nvidia? In the tech world, where speed and innovation reign supreme, a three-month delay might seem significant. However, Nvidia’s legacy of innovation and market leadership paints a different picture. As Hari points out, “any impact to CY2025 earnings will be negligible,” and the temporary setback should not deter investors from seeing Nvidia’s long-term value. For now, Nvidia’s strategy remains rock solid. The potential delay, whether factual or exaggerated, is but a temporary hurdle, according to Hari. As Nvidia navigates this challenge, the market watches closely, with many investors seeing a buying opportunity amid the noise. For those invested in Nvidia's future, Hari’s message is clear: hold steady, as the AI revolution waits for no one.",0.5505,NEGATIVE,0.9994
NVIDIA's share price surge and the outlook for the AI arithmetic market bubble risk and rational lay.csv,"As NVIDIA's share price has risen sharply in the short term, many have begun to wonder if the industry is facing a turning point or if there is a bubble. From the perspective of the industry giants, GPUs, as representatives of A1 arithmetic chips, are currently far from meeting demand. We can assume that AI applications are still only in their infancy, and there has not yet been a particularly prominent Al burst application in the world. Analyse the results: The AI market is still at an early stage: AI applications, despite explosive growth in recent years, are still at an early stage. The arithmetic power required for current AI applications (e.g., big language modelling, autonomous driving, robotics, etc.), especially GPUs, is still in the pre-burst stage. The growth of Tesla and the robotics industry, for example, predicts that billions of robots will be needed in the future for arithmetic support. This means that there is a huge potential for growth in AI arithmetic demand over the next few years, especially in inferential computing. GPUs as core hardware for AI: GPUs play a key role in AI inference computing, especially in tasks that require high parallel processing power (e.g., deep learning inference, autonomous driving, robot control, etc.). Although there are already many GPU products on the market, overall, the demand for AI computing power is still in a state of oversupply, and the size of the AI computing power market is likely to continue to expand, especially in the ‘reasoning’ segment of the demand for this segment is the area of high computation, especially in the field of automated driving, cloud computing and so on. Personal view: NVIDIA's leadership in the GPU space is well recognised, but many are beginning to worry about an industry bubble due to the short-term surge in its share price. NVIDIA's dominant position: Currently, NVIDIA is the almost unrivalled leader in the field of AI hardware (especially GPUs), and its products are widely used in AI training and reasoning calculations, especially playing a central role in large-scale data centres and cloud services. NVIDIA's rising share price reflects investors' optimistic expectations about the potential of the AI market. Bubble Risk: As NVIDIA's share price has surged, the market has become sceptical about whether it is overvalued. NVIDIA's high valuation could lead to the formation of a bubble, especially if its products and technologies are not sufficiently digested by the market. While the AI industry is promising, the market is volatile in the short term and the rise of competitors (e.g. AMD) could change the market landscape. Therefore, investors and industry observers need to be wary of market overheating and short-term speculation. Core view: US tech giants (e.g. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook) are supportive of NVIDIA's technology, but they will also support NVIDIA's competitors, such as AMD, in order to avoid the arithmetic market being monopolised by one company and to ensure the sustainable development of the industry. Analyse the results: Rational rather than short-term profit-driven: the behaviour of these tech giants suggests that they are not simply pursuing short-term profit when purchasing AI arithmetic, but are planning the security and sustainability of their own development in the long term. By supporting competitors such as AMD, these companies avoid the risk of the market becoming too dependent on NVIDIA alone, ensuring diversity in market competition and technological innovation. This kind of rational decision-making is crucial to the healthy development of the AI hardware market. If NVIDIA dominates the AI arithmetic market without competitive pressure, it could lead to overpricing, affecting the interests of other tech giants. As a result, companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon prefer to ensure diversity and healthy competition in the AI arithmetic market by supporting competitors such as AMD. In summary: future outlook and risks Huge potential for AI arithmetic: The demand for AI arithmetic is far from reaching its ceiling, especially in the area of inferential computing, and the market demand for GPUs will continue to grow as robotics and autonomous driving technologies evolve. The adoption of AI technologies will generate even more demand for arithmetic power in the coming decades, especially in emerging technologies such as robotics and autonomous driving. NVIDIA's dominance and risks: While NVIDIA's dominance in the AI hardware space cannot be ignored, the sharp rise in its share price and high market valuation have raised concerns about the existence of a bubble. Future technological competition, especially the rise of competitors such as AMD, may affect NVIDIA's market share. Long-term layout of industry giants: U.S. tech giants are very rational when investing in AI arithmetic, they will not simply pursue short-term benefits, but pay more attention to the diversity of the arithmetic market and the sustainability of the technology, to ensure that they can be invincible in the competition in the coming years. The AI arithmetic market is full of great potential, but is still in the early stages of development. While NVIDIA occupies a leading position in the AI hardware market, its high valuation and share price volatility also make the risk of a bubble",0.5575,POSITIVE,0.7135
NVIDIA’s next catalyst has to be sovereign AI.csv,"NVIDIA’s current valuation is not overtly expensive (FPER: 33, PEG: 1.61 according to FINVIZ) and the GPU orders for next year are all booked. Yet the stock is meeting strong resistance around $130. I think this is partially because a lot of people have been burned by CISCO during dot-com bubble and do not want to price in the future too much. But the real concern is that their revenue is almost entirely dependent on the rest of M7 and they are charging the big tech 80 % margin. The big tech, while being hammered by Wall Street for the increased CAPEX spending, indicated during last earning that they will not reduce their investment on AI. However, they did mention that they are/plan using their NPU (Google TPU, Tesla Dojo, AMD) to reduce the usage of NVIDIA GPU. Furthermore, GPT5 and Apple Intelligence should be available to the public by the end of this year. If these do not impress, the entire AI sector may see significant slowdown. But if GPT5 shows plateauing of performance while people find Apple Intelligence interesting, paradigm could shift toward smaller models and inference efficiency, again reducing the demand for NVIDIA. To justify significant increase in NVIDIA’s stock price, they need to show that they are not entirely dependent on the Big Tech. The only other potential buyers that have as much buying power are governments. Also, if the economy is going through downturns, governments have excuse to increase their spending. What I am paying attention to during the earning call is demonstration from NVIDIA that they are receiving significant demand from non-Big Tech such as governments.",0.5529,NEGATIVE,0.9994

Short Call Strategy Am I Regarded or Might This Actually Work.csv,"Okay, so I'm guessing a good amount of us in this subreddit were new to options trading at some point in time, and when we were just itty bitty option noobs first hearing about them, we just thought: "" Wow! this is just the same thing as betting on stocks but with leverage right?"" (might just be me when I first got into options trading but whatever). Moving on. I assume that many people's first instinct was to go and buy a call on a stock they were very bullish on. And I would assume that once we did that, we lost the entire position because we never knew how theta decay, IV, DTE, strike price, and other factors could sink your entire position. The thing about these factors is that when you buy a call, the majority of these factors are stacked against you, and if you don't want them to be completely stacked against you, you gotta pay up for a higher premium which is gonna yield the same or less of a return then the lower priced (but considerably more risky) options. You're paying for less risk. Long Calls are usually only profitable when the underlying has a significant enough uptick to outweigh all the other factors dragging down the value of the option. I'm sorry I don't mean to repeat the basics of valuing options but I think it's important to pretext them a little bit so my strategy makes more sense in the grand scheme of things. Okay, so my strategy is as follows: why buy a call, and have all of these factors stacked against you, when you can sell one, and have them work in your favor; I guess the whole basis is: the shittier the call, the better (meaning how likely it is to expire or be exercised with no value). The even better thing is we can magnify the shittiness to work in our favor on the sell side by selling balls deep out of the money calls, with low IV, and few DTE. And we can magnify this even further by selling calls on options with really shitty stocks underlying; stocks that are down 40% YTD, or just really, really stagnant not moving anywhere (might also get some sexy low IV to work in your favor there too). I don't really have any stocks in mind right now to lock this trade in off the top of my head, but $NOC and $AMD are quite down this last month and a half, and are relatively popular stocks. Like I said I need to find some better stocks for this Strat; these are not the ones I wanna go with, just what I thought of off the top of my head Now you might be saying two things: 1. ""The prices on them are probably gonna be pennies on the dollar. Sure the odds might be in your favor, but the yield is gonna be very low"", and 2. ""What fucking moron is gonna be stupid enough to buy these calls?"". To answer question 1: Why not just sell more calls? And to answer question 2: I don't think I need to illustrate the stupidity of individuals in the market, but if you need me to, here you go: WSB regards (not dissing, I am also a WSB regard who has lost thousands on YOLOs), teenagers with a Robinhood account that just found out about options, and maybe even people who are legit investors, but have bought the call as a part of some bigger options play, like a straddle, or iron condor (not to mention that in the example of the straddle, I don't think they would really give a shit if the call tanked because, well, it's a straddle lol, the put on the other side would cover the losses and make profit{and yeah there are probably more plays where this is the case that I am just forgetting about, but this is the example I'm just gonna go with for now}). Not to mention markets are huge and I've checked the open interest on some of these calls and there are hundreds going up to the thousands in open interest on balls deep OTM, 2DTE, Low IV call options. Anyways, I guess the reason I made this post is to double check with some options veteran (I've been into options for a little less than a year, but I have some knowledge on them from my job) to see if this strategy is complete delusional manic retardation, or if there is actually some substance to it. I wanna make sure there isn't some variable or factor I'm not accounting for that could tank this entire play.

Makes perfect sense that investors are flooding back into this stock! It has been so beaten down over the last six months by bad press and fears of fraud. Those fears have been quelled by a new CFO and auditing team. We just saw in the last month of 72% rally and there is still plenty of room to run on Monday it will open up around $48, the last critical level we saw was $49. Also, it looks like a somewhat sloppy cup and handle pattern is forming. My half baked technical analysis is. We will see a minor pull back around $50 to finish the pattern, then it will launch back up to the next critical level around $60 a share. Fundamentally speaking, they have been showing plenty of growth and demand for their products which mainly consists of hardware to House semiconductors, especially their trademark marked water cooled rack, which directly addresses a huge issue that centers are facing as computing power gets to Skynet levels. Their price to earnings ratio is a modest 21.9, the earnings per share is a humble 2, the ps ratio is 1.5 which is the lowest among its competitors. In fact all of its metrics or lowest amongst its competitors except for the EPS for AMD, which is 1.1. There will be much to see within the next quarterly earnings report and how they managed to address their auditing issues and reporting issues. But I think this company still has room to run and definitely has legs. I have 200 shares with plans to buy much more. I was going to buy on the next red day, expecting it to be Monday, but I digress. Next pull back I’m buying calls with a strike price of about $49-$55 exp in March. Even considering a YOLO.

"SMCI will skyrocket soon, DONT MISS OUT!.csv","So currently SMCI is around the $840 to $850 levels but hit $775 on monday. This meant that there is still a chance to buy SMCI while the shares are cheap right before they release their earnings in a month. The reason why im bullish on SMCI is because AI is driving the stock to skyrocket as they work alongside Nvidia and AMD in providing data centres. Elon musk had also catapulted the stock to reach over $1000 as he had tweeted that he is partnering with Dell and SMCI to provide AI data centres for its generative AI chatbot. https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/super-micro-computer-ceo-post-picuture-with-elon-musk-at-ai-data-center-432SI-3505317 As a result of this, SMCI will most likely smash their earnings report of $8.10 per share in early august and hopefully make the stock reach above $1100, which is a 30% increase from what the share price is today.

SMCI.csv,"Hello fellow regards, Currently SMCI is trading around the $770 to $800 range and is crucial to the future of AI as they have partnerships with Nvidia and AMD, due to providing complementary AI server systems. Due to their partnerships, and the increasing demand for AI server systems, SMCI had their EPS increase significantly as their EPS forecast is around $8.00 per share, which is a major increase from last year, which was $3.51 per share. They also have a PE ratio that is lower than Nvidia and AMD at around 45, a foward PE of 21.79 and a PEG ratio of under 1. As a result of their PEG ratio being below 1, it means that the company is considered as undervalued, and a good investment to have. The stock is down 40% from ATH and i personally believe that it could reach over $1000 by their next earnings release which is in the end of july.

Strong AI and Semiconductor weeks ahead.csv,"Hi all, I think that AI and esp. Semiconductor Stocks have a couple of strong weeks ahead. Starting on Tuesday, October 15th 2024, the Open Compute Project (OCP) global summit takes place in San Jose, California. Between 9 AM and 11:30 AM there'll be short keynotes (each 12 mins) presented by Meta, NVidia, AI Clusters, Intel, AMD, Microsoft and Google (full schedule here). Now, I don't think that there'll be any big surprises. But the Summit still presents an opportunity for public remarks about how strong the demand is or what so ever. Also, there's an article that says that Broadcom (AVGO) is going to show case cutting-edge AI infrastructure. Further it is expected that Taiwan Semiconductor Company (TSM) and ASML Holding (ASML) will publish their Q3 earnings next week. TSM will present its earnings on October 17th 2024 at 14:00 Taiwan time / 02:00 Eastern Time. So pre-market movements will most likely be wild on Thursday as a large part of the industry relies on TSM. If TSM reports a great Q3 revenue, this could push Nvidia over the current all time high. Also according to Moore's law is dead, the first RTX 5000 series GPUs are ready to be sold, but are not released because of business reasons (here at 22:22). So they could still change their mind and ship in Q4. Next, it is rumored (by moore's law is dead) that AMD will release a new CPU by the end of October or early November, the 9800X3D which is an 8 Core Gaming CPU with 3D cache and it is expected that it will be the fastest gaming CPU releasing this year. Although Client is not as important for AMD, it will still be beneficial to have this CPU released before the holiday season. Especially since Zen5 Rysen has so far been viewed as rather disappointing. Moore's law is dead also mentions an RX 7650 GRE GPU, which could launch alongside Ryzen 9800X3D. Releasing a slightly refreshed and cheap RDNA3 GPU could be a good move by AMD to get rid of RDNA3 stock ahead of the RDNA4 launch in 2025. Since the Ryzen 9800X3D has not yet been anounced, I don't think that it has been priced in and could give the stock a slight boost to recover from the -4% last Thursday. Also, I although Investors were not excited about AMDs Advancing AI event, I think AMDs position in the market is still solid. According to the slides shown at the event, AMD Epic has increased its market share to 34%. And according to tests AMD Epyc Turin obliterates Xeon 6 Granite Rapids, while being cheaper. Because of this, I think AMD is in a good position to gain more server market share. Further, the news about Nvidia Blackwell being sold out for the next 12 Months is not only good news for Nvidia but also for AMD. Sure, everyone wants blackwell. but if one can't get blackwell and if AMD Instinct MI325X is faster than Nvidia Hopper (H200), then they might be able to win over customers from nvidia, who would like to buy blackwell but can't in due time. Also, AMDs earnings should be reported on October 29 2024. Due to Ryzen Zen5 being disappointing and there being apparently a large RDNA3 stock remaining. If AMDs Instinct systems are selling well, this would also be good news for Micron Industries (MU), which produces high bandwith memory (HBM3e). And then there's Intel. Their newest releases seem to have been disappointing. But they claim to be making progress with their foundries.

To start off, we'll go big in the cap spectrum. Our millenial buys AAPL products, uses MSFT Excel and Outlook at their ""Information Worker"" job. They are frequently gamers, so they need to buy NVDA GPUs and AMD CPUs. They often buy these at AMZN. They buy YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, so they can skip the ads of their fellow influencers (GOOGL) They spent most of their waking hours at META's Instagram website. They drive a TSLA or RIVN. They're on the GLP-1 drug (LLY) to impress their SOs. They're churning their credit cards with AXP Platinum and Gold, JPM's Chase Sapphire Preffered (no, NOT Reserve), some younger ones need to rely on COF's Venture and Venture X cards that gave nice ""subs"". They use these cards frequently to eat out and earn those points at CMG, SHAK and SG. They're flying a lot on DAL, and they need their free wifi that is often sponsored by their preferred choice of mobile carrier, TMUS. To get to the airport they need to use UBER or LYFT, since they don't want to drive their sweet electric ride. When they arrive at their destination airport, they pick up their rental car, and of course they prefer AVIS (CAR), but their credit cards give them presential circle status on HTZ, so they are ok with that too. They check into their hotel room at Marriott (MAR) to impress their friends, but really they are using all their Chase points to book Hyatt (H) hotels. The slightly less premium young ones will have to go Hilton (HLT) and fly on UAL. They often booked all this travel on EXPE or BKNG. Sometimes they use ABNB. When they check in they need to get some food, so they use their DASH gift card they bought at COST every two weeks because they get 20% off. When they go to Vegas, they prefer to stay in WYNN, because it's where all the hot ones stay. After they're done with their holidaying which they do basically 4 months out of the year, they're going to ULTA or LULU to buy their beauty products or Khakis. They are drop shipping on SHOP and sometimes they need to use ZM to conduct ""business"" for their ""coaching classes"" that they teach. A lot of times they get paid using Venmo (PYPL).

"The next tech giant Why HOOD, PLTR and DKNG are the investment opportunities of a lifetime (Part 1).csv","I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong. $AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice. $NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were. And so in true wsb fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB. There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long. From a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about. And so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry : If you are under 40 years old, $HOOD (Finance), $PLTR (Defense) and $DKNG (gambling) will 100x during your investment horizon.

The short report for Intel (INTC) - A rabbit hole of CPU failures rate since 2022.csv,"Forenote: Im a technical person, A developer, this will be a technical DD to show how intel is failing to do their basic business model of manufacturing CPUs. Over the past month or so Intels customers have been becoming increasing irrate about CPUs just flat out dying after various finger pointing from Intel being debunked. I first caught wind of intels failures when a friends system started to become unstable, he would crash in games and sometimes doing mundane tasks. It all came to a clicking point when his systems files started becoming corrupted and he needed to attempt reinstalling windows. The attempts failed, windows couldnt even install without corrupted files, sometimes it would install and look fine, but running a verification shows that various system files were still corrupted but not important enough for the system to boot successfully. He would still get various crashes doing mundane things and gaming. It was basically a working brick at this point. So i got my research hat on, and discovered various reddit users on r/pcmasterrace were also reporting instability with their PCs. Not alot tho, this has been the wierd thing, Intel has such a large CPU failure rate, but not alot of reports which caught everyone by suprise. It started to make sense, the causes of the crashes were different for everything. Users were reporting issues with Nvidia, Issues with RAM, and issues with corrupted data. Obviously to any layman, these issues dont instantly point to an issue with the CPU. With GPU errors, Nvidia initially got heat, but Nvidia quickly debunked the issue reporting the GPUs that were returned were fully functional and had no issues. So I pulled out my handy dandy debug tools since my friend managed to get windows installed and it kinda runs. The first tests I ran were memory block verification. This validates that the memory is able to hold data immutably, after 4 hours the tests finished all green, the memory was stable and wasnt corrupting data. (its worth noting that the memory test software I used was very CPU lite so the CPU has little chance to corrupt the data its self, this is a stark difference to the Drive tests I ran.). Since my friend was getting corrupted files almost everytime he install anything, I ran the disk debug tools, these pull the S.M.A.R.T data from the drive and run various read and write tests. The S.M.A.R.T data came back green, the drive was reporting it had no errors or irregularies and was functioning fine, So i moved to the read and write tests, all red, the drive had a 90% file currption rate, I pulled the S.M.A.R.T data again, All green, the drive was still reporting it was functioning correctly. At this point, anyone would deduce they had a bad drive that was misbehaving, leading to the decreased number of CPU failure reports. After all, How can you say the CPU is bad when you have corrupt files? Many people forget how much the CPU is responsable for. When you read files or write files, its the CPU that tells the Drive what to store and where and what to read and where it is on the disk to read it from. and as i said, the software I used to test the drives is CPU intensive, it uses the the CPU to generate random data to store on the drive and hashes that data to verify it. So a bad CPU = Currupted data on the drive. Luckly my friend has 4 drives, So I told him to take out the ""bad"" drive and put in another one, I ran all my tests again and same result, the drive was reporting it was functional, but all the data was corrupted. The result was the same with all the drives tested. Now, this is a luxary many people dont have. Many people would get corrupted data on their drive and think the drive is dying and get a new one. However with 4 tests samples all failing the same way when days ago they were all fine is a very low chance. Now for the kicker, Intel has a tool to verify that the Intel CPU you have is a genuine Intel CPU, I guess intel has a problem of china making fake intel CPUs??? Ive never seen any but what the hell, its a useful tools since its does some basic CPU level checks. So i ran the verifier tool and its first test for a genuine CPU comes back green, Cool, it is a real Intel CPU. Memory test comes back green (We alreadt tested this soo good), next was the Graphics tests. Failed, the CPU was attempting to send data to the GPU and it corrupted the GPU memory. So now we have 2 symptoms. Disk data corruption GPU memory corruption My friend has Nvidia GPU and Nvidia previously debunked any issues with their GPUs. But we have a common cause, Intel CPUs are corrupting data when sending it to another device in the system (except RAM), Data sent to a disk gets corrupted and data sent to the GPU gets corrupted, which would explain the game crashes. Various other tests passed from boost speed changing, Wifi tests and math operations. After I finished all the tests and determed the issue is with the CPU, my friend RMA'd the CPU. This is where more troubles start. Intel refused the RMA, citing user damage, According to intel all the issues my friend was having was his fault and he caused the damage, After it was refused, I filed the RMA for him, to the same response, but because im a stickler I pushed for more info, Intel was refusing the RMA because of overclocking done by the motherboard. This is a previous blame game intel played, they were blaming Motherboards for putting in stock overclocks on CPUs causing them to fail, but this wasnt the case with my friend, his motherboard wasnt even stock overclocked, but intel refused it anyway. After this point is when the waterfall started coming down, a advanced tech-youtuber posted an exposé about intels CPU failures. See: Intel has a HUGE problem - Level1Tech the curtains were starting to fall, Apparently Game developers and datacenters (Intels BIGGEST customers) were getting large amounts of CPU failures specificly with intel CPUs. Now datacenters are normally quiet about this type of thing, opting to sort their issues directly with intel, but intel is turning away datacenters RMA's of thousands of CPUs, these datacenters has since publicly reported they are dropping intel systems from their products and only supporting AMD systems from now on. Intel has lost their largest customer base, because of their defective products and refusing to take responsability for the product inherit flaw. Intel is hoping this goes unnoticed, since reports are still low of CPUs failing because the errors are random and different each time and users dont know their CPU is defective, there isnt a big in your face ""The Intel CPU in this system has errored"" its always an error with something else, which is caused by the CPU. So intel is betting on customers blaming other manufactures like they did with Nvidia when this all started. Timeline of events: [Dec 2022] The first instances of ""Out of Video Memory"" issues on 13th Gen Core i9 CPUs were reported back in 2022. (Source: Reddit). This is a few months after the release of Intel's 13th Gen CPUs & RTX 40 GPUs. [Throughout 2023] Several users have started reporting game crashes and issues in high-profile AAA titles such as Callisto Protocol and Hogwarts Legacy (among many others). Both tiles are based on Unreal Engine (released in 2023) and feature a shader compilation process at the start. There are currently thousands of such issues reported on Steam Community Forums and Reddit. [February 2024] A post by Sebastian Castellanos brings the issue to the limelight, highlighting the ""worrying trend"" of stability issues affecting 14th and 13th-gen CPUs. [February 2024] Our editor along with various other tech outlets start reporting the issue and bringing the matter on to the mainstream media. Quickly, it is pointed out that underclocking and undervolting the chips can result in better stability. [April 2024] NVIDIA Issued a formal statement that the stability issues are not related to its GPUs but rather Intel CPUs. [April 2024] Intel announces its investigation of the reports of instability issues affecting 13th and 14th Gen CPUs. [April 2024] Oodle Publishes about their discovery about users Intel systems experiencing data corruption. [April 2024] Motherboard makers quickly roll out ""Baseline"" power profiles in new BIOS, which lower power limits on high-end 14th & 13th Gen CPUs but also lead to significant performance drops. [May 2024] Intel releases a statement, recommending motherboard makers to ship ""Intel Default Settings"" in BIOS by default rather than customized settings. [June 2024] Intel discovers a bug within its eTVB microcode while investigating the root cause of 14th and 13th Gen Instability issues. This doesn't fix the instability problems. Board makers quickly roll out BIOS with a new microcode fix. [June 2024] Alderon Games publishes about there players, developers and servers Intel CPUs failing over a period of months and switch to only AMD systems. [July 2024] Intel denies an RMA to HardwareTimes editor who already RMA'd at least two CPUs which produced instability issues. [July 2024] Wendell from Level1Techs & Steve Burke from GamersNexus are the first big tech media outlets on YouTube to further highlight the instability issues, diving into additional details such as OEM frustration with the matter and a possible recall. [July 2024] GamersNexus highlights a potential ""oxidation"" defect being a problem with a certain batch of Intel 14th & 13th Gen CPUs that might lead to instability problems. [July 2024] Intel says the 14th & 13th Gen Mobile CPUs are not affected by the same instability issues as the desktop CPUs. [July 2024] GamersNexus reports they will not be recommending Intel CPUs regardless of the outcome for upcoming AMD 9000 series reviews [July 2024] Intel issues a statement confirming that they have found the root cause of the instability issues which happen to be elevated operating voltages and will be issuing a new microcode fix to its partners by mid of August [July 2024] Users are reporting instability issues with Intel 14th gen Laptop CPUs.

Edit: Ive received internal leaks from Intel employees explaining internal issues and intels failures. Source 1: The leading theory inside Intel right now, and it is just a theory, is that the Ring Bus is getting cooked because it's fed by the same rail as the P-Cores and E-Cores. Raptor Lake required incredibly high voltages that the clocks required to be competitive with Zen 4, and it seems like it was just pushed too hard. This is an inherent flaw that would be in Bartlett too it's overvolted. Meteor Lake isn't affected, and Emerald Rapids is unlikely be effected materially. Source 2: I never worked directly on Raptor Lake [Intel Design Engineer], but I did have exposure to Alder Lake, and I can confirm that they were very concerned about the ring bus getting damaged if the voltage was pushed too high. I can also confirm that Raptor Lake was rushed through the design and validation process... Source 3: I [Intel Foundry Services] can tell you that Raptor Lake was rushed through our Fab in Arizona in record time, but it's also produced in other fabs. However, this location (Arizona) is notable because I can confirm that there was an Oxidation issue caused by some failure in our HVAC system between March & June of 2023. It was so bad that Keyvan Esfarjani had to fly in to make decision about which wafers (which cost as much as a Model X each) needed to be thrown away. To be clear, I don't know what decision was made, but I do know that this event DID happen. And by the way, it affected Sapphire Rapids yields as well...although I doubt it's an issue that wasn't",0.5221,NEGATIVE,0.9929

Update on Intel Short report - We won.csv,"Update of The short report for Intel (INTC) - A rabbit hole of CPU failures rate since 2022. Yes while the main points of the short report were not mentioned and intel continues to hide this infomation from Investors, they cant ignore the impact it has on their bottom line. RMA's are not cheap and the amount of money and time they are spending to fix the issue for existing chips while trying their hardest to deny RMAs for failed CPUs. Customers have lost faith in Intel, their chips are constantly beaten by AMD offerings and having a high failure rate really was the last nail in the coffin.

VSH - The Forgotten King of Chips.csv,"TLDR: $VSH (Vishay Intertechnology) is printing money while everyone sleeps on it. $VSH just got the stamp of approval from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, confirming it as a hidden winner in Nvidia’s AI and RTX 50 supply chain. With key wins in MOSFETs, capacitors, and resistors, $VSH is now primed for explosive growth, riding Nvidia’s dominance in AI servers and GPUs. If you’re not jacked up on $VSH, you’re not meant to have money. Who is $VSH? Vishay Intertechnology is a veteran in the electronics industry. They make essential components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and semiconductors. You know, the boring stuff that makes your GPU, PS5, and electric toothbrush actually work. They’ve been doing this since 1962. That’s right, this company has survived every market downturn, bubble, and chip shortage in the last 60+ years. Meanwhile, you can’t even survive a red day on SPY. Why $VSH is printing money: Chips are everywhere—cars, phones, smart homes, AI servers. The global semiconductor market is growing at an insane pace (projected $1 trillion market by 2030). Guess what? Vishay is supplying the guts. Look at their P/E ratio: 12.5 (as of last check). Compare that to Nvidia’s 75+ or AMD’s 30-ish. $VSH is practically trading at the bargain bin, and yet their revenues are consistently strong. Vishay’s last earnings report crushed expectations, with double-digit growth in several segments. They’re sitting on $3.4B in annual revenue with plans to scale. Oh, and they’re buying back shares like they’re on clearance at Costco. Everyone’s hyped about Nvidia because of AI. Guess what? Vishay supplies components used in AI hardware, EV charging stations, and industrial automation. While Nvidia makes the sexy GPUs, Vishay sells the boring but essential resistors and capacitors that keep those GPUs from melting your motherboard. They’re eating up the market share. Recent Catalysts: Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo dropped a bombshell: Vishay is a key supplier for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI servers (GB200 series, DGX/HGX B200) and the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. These are Nvidia’s future bread-and-butter products, dominating AI and high-end gaming. Vishay replaced Infineon as Nvidia’s MOSFET supplier. Yes, Infineon, the semiconductor giant, just got sidelined. This Is MASSIVE for $VSH. Vishay is providing MOSFET/DrMOS (VRPower), vPolyTan (Polymer Tantalum Capacitors), and Current Shunt Resistors. These components are critical for Nvidia’s most cutting-edge products: • GB200 series AI servers: Nvidia’s next-gen AI infrastructure. • RTX 50 series GPUs: The next flagship graphics cards. Vishay’s vPolyTan capacitors (especially the T55 series) are already facing a supply crunch for 2025. That’s how in-demand they are. Kuo estimates that Vishay’s MOSFET production alone will contribute 20%-30% of revenue by 2025—with above-average gross profit margins. The vPolyTan capacitors will add a high single-digit percentage of revenue with significantly above-average margins. Translation? Vishay is printing money. Vishay’s production lines are already at capacity through 2025. When your biggest challenge is meeting demand, you’re in a good spot. Beyond Nvidia, Vishay is also poised to benefit from: • Automotive rebound: As EV production scales, Vishay’s components are critical. • IoT growth: Billions of devices mean billions of tiny components. Vishay is at the center of it. The Stock Is Still Cheap Even after today’s 7% jump to $18.35, $VSH is wildly undervalued. As I said earlier, the P/E ratio is still around 12-13, compared to Nvidia’s 75+. This is a company with real earnings, real dividends, and real growth potential. This is a great opportunity to make back everything you lost from your MSTR calls. Positions: Shares, 01/17/25 20C",0.5352,POSITIVE,0.9824

"Weekly jobless claims fall to 233,000, less than expected, in a positive sign for labor market.csv","Last night, the U.S. announced that the number of initial unemployment claims for last week was 233,000, significantly lower than the previous week's 249,000 and also below the market's expectation of 240,000! A few days ago, Mr. Wang mentioned that for the U.S. stock market to stop declining, the economic and labor data released must continue to be strong in order to ease concerns about a potential economic recession. Yesterday's sharp drop in initial unemployment claims marked the largest decrease in a year, indicating that the number of people recently unemployed has decreased. This alleviated the recession concerns raised by last Friday's non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate data, spurring a rally in U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 index surging over 2.3%, the largest single-day gain in 21 months 📈. On the other hand, the demand for the 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds at the auctions over the past two days was poor, causing the 10-year yield to exceed 4% once again! Tech giants saw a broad rebound, with Meta rising 4.2%, Alphabet up 1.9%, Amazon gaining 1.8%, Apple increasing 1.6%, and Microsoft rebounding 1%. Nvidia surged over 6%, returning to the $100 mark, leading to a rebound in semiconductor stocks. Broadcom, Micron, and Applied Materials all jumped more than 6%, while Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and AMD all saw gains of over 5%! Taiwan's ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) also rebounded, with TSMC and UMC both jumping more than 6%, and ASE gaining over 4%. However, it's still important to note that the number of continuing unemployment claims is rising, reaching its highest level since November 2021, nearly three years ago! Therefore, Wall Street's foreign investors remain concerned about the economy. For example, JPMorgan still believes the U.S. economy will enter a recession, raising the probability from 25% to 35%!

Why I am going long on Intel and letting Bad Daddy Gelsinger take me to Uranus - DD TurboNerd Post.csv,"TLDR: This stock fucking sucks, and I love it. But the developing foundry business is gonna get absolutely bananas under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for the sole purpose of developing it. They are not gonna let the other chip companies continue to take nut shots on them and they are just gonna make everyone chips for them. Anyways I all in on Mar 2025 Calls (which are like $4.50 - $5.00) right now. Here is some DD. Dog of the Dow Intel has lagged behind other chip titans such as [[AMD - AMD]] and [[NVDA -NVIDIA]] as they race to design and build chips to handle [[AI]] workloads. Both AMD and NVIDA have seen tremendous growth over the past 18 months (as of June 2024). A growth pattern that has gone completely unanswered by INTEL up until this point. Looking at the [[Price to Earnings Ratio]] of both AMD and NVIDIA it is easy to see how disconnected from earnings they have become (though they are both incredibly profitable). AMD P/E Ratio: 67.30 NVIDIA P/E Ratio: 238.53 INTEL P/E Ratio 31.79 AMD is wildly inflated relative to its competition in the space. NVDA is has a more ""sane"" price to earnings but it has also been nearly printing its own money with the amount of sales it has been making. The price of NVIDIA still ""feels"" high despite it's recent split. Another interesting metric to take a look at is the [[Price/Tangible Book]] - Where you take the current price of the stock and compare it to the tangle value of all its assets minus good will. AMD P/TB Ratio: 23.61 NVIDIA P/TB Ratio: 64.73 INTEL P/TB Ratio: 1.75 This says a few things; One either Intel has barely any assets worth liquidating relative to its stock price and the market has priced the stock appropriately, OR the price of the stock is selling for a very reasonable price related to the actual value of the company. This could be considered paying only .75 above book value of the company as a ""premium"" for future expected value. Source: Any trading platform that has data you ding dongs - go look it up. I got these from Schwab jfc. Technical Except for this past Wednesday, this company has been hard stuck around $30 after a selloff from its 52 week high of $51.28. 31.50 appears to be the most reliable resistance level we can work off of right now, then $32.50 after that. If it breaks both of those on a run up, there is literally no ceiling until $46. SO, you tell me what that means. The further you zoom out on your shitty little trading app the more you will see that this period we are in is nothing but consolidation. Foundry Intel's new foundry business will be the corner stone of its future growth. Forget the in house made chips. The company is not-so-silently tyring to be the American version of TSMC. Here is an article they posted on their own site outlining their model. https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-outlines-new-financial-reporting-structure.html#gs.a8z07s Note this section: April 9th 2024 ""Intel Foundry is a newly established operating segment that includes foundry technology development, foundry manufacturing and supply chain, and foundry services (formerly IFS). Under this new structure, Intel Foundry will recognize revenues generated from both external foundry customers and Intel Products..."" Fuck me, if they pull this off under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for this specific function, this stock could easily moon. Not to mention this article detailing that NVIDIA will start using Intels Foundry to start making its own chips. https://www.techspot.com/news/101725-nvidia-turning-intel-foundry-services-expand-gpu-ai.html#:~:text=Nvidia%20could%20also%20choose%20to,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202024. Chips Act ""U.S. Department of Commerce has proposed up to $8.5 billion in direct funding through the CHIPS and Science Act to advance Intel’s commercial semiconductor projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon. Intel also expects to benefit from a U.S. Treasury Department Investment Tax Credit (ITC) of up to 25% on more than $100 billion in qualified investments and eligibility for federal loans up to $11 billion. Proposed funding supports Intel’s previously announced plans to invest more than $100 billion in the U.S. over five years to expand U.S. chipmaking capacity and capabilities critical to economic and national security and acceleration of emerging technologies, such as AI. Intel’s investments are expected to create more than 10,000 company jobs and nearly 20,000 construction jobs, and to support more than 50,000 indirect jobs with suppliers and supporting industries. "" https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/us-chips-act-intel-direct-funding.html#gs.a8z5ze So yea Intel is gonna get paid, and quite a bit. The article states that they are slated to receive up to $8.5 billion, with a B. X86 chips - Speculation With Arm taking dominance over portable computers like laptops, tablets and phones, X86 looks pretty boring. Except you have to remember that both AMD and Intel are still cranking these bad boys out like nobody's business. The raw horsepower in these for desktop workstations and servers is still not matched by ARM and probably wont be for quite a while. Sure they are not quite as power efficient, but who cares in a data center or major compute space anyways. Intel owns almost all of the IP for X86 processors too. AMD has a little bit and they have made improvements and designs of their own that they have been able to patent, but INTEL is the OG maker of these chips. Arm will probably continue to dominate the landscape, but they are the people who license their chips are going to need them made somewhere. They will have like two options. Intel or TSMC. China What happens when CHYNA pulls the trigger and takes over Taiwan. Where is everyone gonna have their chips made? Arizona, that's where. TSMC and Intel are both setting up MASSIVE Fabs there. So, when all the other chip companies get absolutely smoked I expect to see a giant green candle on that morning for INTC. I will probably write more later but this shit got way long way fast.

Why I bought Puts on MNST (Monster).csv,"Since Monster releases its earnings report after market, it’s time for some puts… or calls if you are based and want to inverse me Reason 1: High expectations - Current expectations for this quarterly are quite high.. Expected earnings per share are $0.452 as opposed to the $0.400 of a year ago . In this same light the market expects (has already priced in) a nearly 200 million dollar increase in revenue from the year prior.. Put quite simply these massive increases are already expected and priced in, and it’s much easier to fall short when expectations are this high Reason 2: Competition - PepsiCo is fighting hard for market share of the energy drink market and threw $550 million dollars for an 8.5% share of Celsius in 2022. Monster has already struggled to maintain market share versus Red Bull, which owns the largest portion of the energy drink market.. Now on top of this already stiff competition they have to deal with a whale like PepsiCo flooding the market with products like Rockstar and Celsius over time Reason 3: regulation- As more health focused initiatives take place in Europe and America, products like monster will face increased scrutiny, both from consumers and governments alike (regulations on certain contents). Reason 4: Even those who hit their goals have been getting smashed… AMD and Reddit- Now I get what you are thinking “what the heck do these companies have to do with monster”… and yea they have no direct relationship.. But even after surpassing their goals for this last quarter these companies have seen their value get smashed.. The market is being mad weird and bearish right now when it comes to earnings. So in essence this combined with reason 1 (the high goals they already have), means that I feel that the odds favor the Put/bear side Hope you enjoyed my presentation!!

"Why I think Intel is a Misunderstood, Undervalued Play – A Bet on 18A (+EV DD).csv","Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.",0.5307,NEGATIVE,0.9997
Why Intel is the most undervalued tech stock right now.csv,"Intel ($INTC) is an insane bargain right now, as it is trading at year 1999 stock price. Every other comparable tech stock is up 5000%-20000% since then. People are too focused on Intel consumer and data center products, which by the way are improving at impressive rate. Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3). Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD & NVIDIA offerings. But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment. Currently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons. Microsoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in.

Since 2021 (before my dad got this cancer shit), I spoke with him and he basically said just look at the fundamentals of a company and invest in growth companies that you think will be around in 5-10 years. I look for value within growth stocks (i know paradoxical). Some of my icons in investing are David Tepper & Michael Burry. Again below is all my own experience and reflects only my own views and are not a recommendation of my company (corporate. disclaimer). My portfolio is heavily weighted (85%) between several stocks: AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL (So fucking cheap r u kidding me sorry), NVDA, AMZN, AMD, CRM, COST, RIVN (RIP), AVGO, VOO (ik not a stock) <-- I know semi(s) are very cyclical but i believe in holding all of these companies for 5-10 years, so I don't have to worry about temp. earnings beats/misses etc. Much easier to pick a stock and hold it for a while then it is to get the timing right. Roughly at 175% return in the past 3 years. (hammered META at $100's, NVDA at $200 both in 2022) Roughly 15% of my bets are moonshots (note the word bet hehe) with promise but objectively could be overvalued/bad investments: CCL/RCL (both are crushing it and between them own 75% of the cruise line market), LCID/RIVN (going to 0 bc they can't scale profitably or will make u a very happy person 3 years down the line bc R2/Atlas at 45k/50k should capture a significant portion of model y demand), TTD, DKNG/FLUT - gambling hasn't even been legalized in Cali/Texas (the biggest markets in the U.S. come on), RBLX (feels like betting against youtube in the early innings w/o realizing how much rev. they're actually recognizing), PYPL (value - cheap af (bought at $60) should turn around in a couple years) I joke I allocate like google's budget where it's 90% bread&butter and the rest are moonshots. Was very depressed (still reasonably depressed) because I'm not sure how much time my dad has. I hope in a way I can pass some of these stocks to my kid in a better place than I found it.

"Advanced Micro Devices to See Continued Share Gains in Notebook, Server Processors, Morgan Stanley.csv","Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is poised for continued share gains in notebook and server processors through 2025, according to Morgan Stanley's analysis of the company's product roadmap. Morgan Stanley anticipates that AMD's core business will ""accelerate meaningfully"" as the PC market continues to recover and server upgrades resume. The investment firm noted that AMD is likely to capture a disproportionate share of these larger projects as upgrades progress. AMD's increased Q3 revenue guidance of about $6.7 billion at the midpoint reflects ""strong momentum across compute businesses,"" according to Morgan Stanley. This momentum underscores the company's effective strategy and execution, positioning it well for sustained growth. Artificial intelligence is also expected to be a significant growth driver for AMD. The company's advancements in AI technology and its strategic roadmap place it in a favorable position to capitalize on the burgeoning AI market. While there are potential delays in the deployment of new AI silicon, the overall outlook remains robust. Morgan Stanley maintains an equal-weight rating on Advanced Micro Devices and has raised its price target to $178 from $176, reflecting confidence in the company's future performance. AMD's strategic positioning and continued execution of its roadmap suggest a promising trajectory.

AI chipmaker Cerebras files for IPO to take on Nvidia - But 87% of its revenues have come from the U.csv,"The Middle East wants chips badly but US restrictions prevent the US most powerful chips entering into certain geographical areas such as China and the Middle East; this entails the UAE. Nevertheless, the UAE wants in on the GPU chips craze and is apparently willing to pay anything to enter into the chip bonanza. The UAE can't get Nvidia's, AMD's, or Intel's best GPU chips so instead they are investing heavily into alternatives such as Cerebras. There is nothing inherently wrong with this but it's also the biggest red flag as an investment opportunity. If the agreements for Nvidia chips open up in the Middle East and specifically with the UAE that could be a crushing blow to this aspiring startup. Specifically, Cerebras Systems reported a net loss of $66.6 million for the first six months of 2024, on $136.4 million in revenue. For the same period in 2023 it has a net loss of $77.8 million on just $8.7 million in sales. 87% of this revenue for the first half of 2024 was directly from the UAE G42. The other red flag from this startup is the way in which they promote their business. It's all seemingly smoke and mirrors and conveniently based on outdated GPU pricing and throughput information; which is very publically available. For some reason, Groq and Cerebras love to keep using memory to unlock speeds on small/tiny models which is impractical and inefficient for a scaled system; or a system that is a large foundational LLM. As well, they have no clue what models will do next so it's a major after the fact architecture that uses llama because they have access to it. https://cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebras-inference-ai-at-instant-speed. A prime example of this is OpenAI's GPT-o1 model that uses reasoning in coordination with its model capabilities. Because they are not being used on the forefront of this technology they don't know how or when a model's size, function, or needs will evolve into the future. All of this plus the pricing from OpenAI and Microsoft is coming down exponentially. For Example: They are referring to a 70b param model that shoves an entire model onto memory. They are going up against h100's which is a very old technology at this point. They make no reference to h200's let alone blackwell Because they are referencing such a small model the pricing model they suggest would be radically different for a 400b param model and forget about trillion param models which are coming next. They're not being truthful about tokens per s. As of today this is Azure GPT 4o and GPT 4 mini tokens per minute gpt-4o & GPT-4 Turbo global standard Model Tier Quota Limit in tokens per minute (TPM) Requests per minute gpt-4o Enterprise agreement 30 M 180 K gpt-4o-mini Enterprise agreement 50 M 300 As you can clearly see 30 million tokens per minute is 500k tokens per second and mini is 833,333 tokens per second. So i don't know why they are referring to 20 tokens per second or their 450 tokens per second seems way off. maybe they mean million. Even if that is the case and 70 b would be more like mini it is way higher than their limit. On pricing which they lay out a 3:1 input versus output is fine the price would be for mini which is a comparable model is roughly .10 cents (input) + .20 cents = .30 cents. Per million. for regular 4o it would be higher and let's face it GPT 4o is a far superior model than llama 3.1 3.33 dollar + 5 = $8.33 Source: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/ From this information what I can tell you is that what we just went over is pricing. it is not some guarantee for what a model produces per second. That shit is very random. What I can tell you is from GPT 4 to GPT 4 turbo to Gpt 4o the speed is dramatically better. GPT 4o mini is damn near real time. Take that for what it's worth. I am not saying they're being dishonest here but I am saying they are being very cheeky with how they advertise things. The company is currently being primarily supported by the UAE, with investments worth roughly $900 million for new AI supercomputers known as the Condor Galaxy series. Any growth here is singular to this source of investment and not driven by organic growth or usage. This is not a competitor to Nvidia but rather a temporary solution in the Middle East until chip embargoes are alleviated. The media here loves to use sexy headlines on non-technical verifications of what it is they are actually comparing. I.e. H100's are now old, or The fact an entity may need to serve millions of clients... No they are instead reporting self-prompting headlines from Cerebras that say things like our chips are 20x faster than Nvidia. Live Update: As I am writing and researching this topic it has just been reported by Reuters that the U.S. is setting a new rule to allow chip shipments to the Middle East including the UAE which is a boon to Nvidia and Microsoft. US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East Here are couple excerpts: WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), to data centers in the Middle East. G42, a UAE-based AI company with historic ties to China, has been a focus of those concerns. In April, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), opens new tab announced that it would invest $1.5 billion in the company, with plans to provide G42 with chips and model weights, sophisticated data that improves an AI model's ability to emulate human reasoning.The deal drew scrutiny from China hardliners in Congress, even though G42 said in February that it had divested from China and was accepting constraints imposed on it by the United States to work with American companies. LOL you can't make this up. Literally this just got reported by Reuters today 9/30/2024. This completely aligns with my argument above regarding the UAE-G42. With chips now entering into the Middle East from Nvidia and potentially others I don't know how this startup IPO makes it off the ground. I don't mean to be bearish but I don't think this is the time for them to raise an IPO without showing more progress. I could be wrong. As of now, I don't plan on buying any shares. Instead, I will be adding more shares into Nvidia because now this is bullish news for Nvidia.",0.5441,NEGATIVE,1.0

AMD CEO Lisa Su Says AI Is In Early Stages Of Multiyear 'Supercycle' 'There's Tremendous Need For Mo.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) shares are experiencing an upward trend after the company reported strong second-quarter financial results. Following the announcement, CEO Lisa Su emphasized that the chipmaker’s performance is being driven by a multiyear AI “supercycle.” What To Know: Recently, chip stocks saw a sell-off as earnings season approached, with investors questioning the timeline for significant returns on the massive investments in AI. This led to speculation that spending on AI might slow down. However, early earnings reports indicate that capital expenditures have remained robust. Su’s comments on CNBC’s “Squawk On The Street” Wednesday provide reassurance against slowdown concerns. She stated, “From the conversations that I have with our customer set and sort of the broader industry, we can see that AI is a multiyear, you know, I would call it a supercycle frankly. There’s tremendous need for more compute.” AMD reported second-quarter revenue of $5.835 billion and adjusted earnings of 69 cents per share, surpassing analyst estimates as its AI business continues to see accelerating demand. The chipmaker also updated its forecast, expecting GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion this year, up from the previous forecast of more than $4 billion. Su highlighted that analysts and investors are “hypersensitive” to minor quarter-over-quarter changes. She believes that the AI story should be viewed in a broader context, suggesting that the demand is extraordinarily high. “I wouldn’t be hypersensitive in those areas ... Are more customers using it? Is every enterprise asking for it? Are we seeing more applications on a daily, weekly, monthly basis? The answer to that is absolutely yes,” she said. “Everywhere I go, everyone wants to talk about how can we incorporate AI into our businesses faster and more efficiently ... this early in the cycle, there’s a lot of learning and experimentation, but definitely, there will be the return on the investment on the other side,” Su added. Although the return on investment isn’t “instantaneous,” it’s occurring very quickly. AI is already boosting productivity and enabling companies to bring better products to market faster. Su emphasized, “We’re investing today for the return in a couple of years, and I think that’s absolutely the right thing to do. That’s the way to think about these investment cycles.” AMD’s strategic focus on AI and its strong financial performance underscore its robust position in the rapidly evolving technology landscape, highlighting the company’s potential for sustained growth in the coming years.",0.5537,NEGATIVE,0.8673

Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year. This report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure. With Nvidia's earnings report on the horizon, AMD's results offer a useful benchmark. Although AMD has significantly underperformed Nvidia year-to-date, this could be an opportunity to turn the tables. Data Center Growth is Key Analysts predict AMD's data center revenue will reach a record $3.52 billion for Q3. In July, CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in strong revenue growth for the year's second half, driven by demand for Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. Earlier this month, AMD launched its latest data center AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, and investors are keen to see its performance. Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari pointed to sustained growth in AI infrastructure capital expenditure, a recovery in server CPUs, and AMD's ongoing market share gains.

"Apple reportedly seeks to lock out its competitors from TSMC's 2nm process, by booking all of its ma.csv","Apple has long been cozy with TSMC, the manufacturer of the chips that end up in ever-popular iPhone, iPad and Mac products. When you've got as much cash on hand as Apple does, it puts it in a favorable position to negotiate deals with the Taiwan-based chipmaker. Now it is reportedly seeking to lock in 100% of TSMC's bleeding edge 2nm production capacity, giving it a competitive advantage when products eventually make their way to the market. According to 9to5mac (via Extreme tech), Apple's chief operating officer met with TSMC bosses to negotiate terms to secure 2nm capacity. The report cites 'local sources', so there needs to be a pinch of salt here, but given Apple's track record of locking up TSMC's capacity, this would certainly come as no surprise. TSMC's 2nm process is currently scheduled to enter risk production in 2025, with volume production set for the second half of 2025. That means the upcoming iPhone 16 family with A18 chips will stick with 3nm, but it could mean the high end iPhone 17 Pro and Max could be the first in line to be built with 2nm technology. The specifics of deals between TSMC and its customers are obviously not made public, but it is widely accepted that Apple booked all of TSMC's 3nm capacity, at least for a period of time. These chips, including the A17 and M3 families made their way into the latest generation iPhone 15 Pros and MacBooks. That would make Apple's 2nm play unsurprising. It's easy to see why Apple would attempt to secure the maximum amount of 2nm capacity. It will give it an advantage over its competitors, as 2nm chips will allow Apple to pack in more transistors into a given area, leading to better performance or lower power consumption—if not both. Samsung has its own manufacturing capacity, and future Exynos chips will be built in-house, but 2nm Snapdragon and possibly Google Tensor chips may have to wait in line behind Apple. Even mega-companies such as Google and Qualcomm don't have the cash on hand to outbid big daddy Apple. It's not just Arm competitors that will be disadvantaged. Nvidia will want every possible power and performance advantage it can get as it dominates the market for AI processors, while AMD will also have to wait for access to the best nodes. Even Intel could find itself at a disadvantage given some of the tiles for its chips are manufactured by TSMC.

"BEARISH NVDA Development Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Intel developing open standard AI Accelerator .csv","Full Article: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-giants-form-industry-group-120000567.html NVDA's current GPU (AIPU) market domination currently stands at 85-95% of the accelerator market. This is pushing profit margins to extreme levels, protected by a moat defended by CUDA and their consistent R&D in the space, leading to further chip advancements along inference and power efficiencies at a much faster pace than their competitors (AMD/INTEL in particular). This new open standards alliance (UALink Promoter Group) for the interconnect (a.k.a backbone) of server clusters challenges NVDA's own proprietary interconnect systems, but will likely not be able to compete with the new B200 line being delivered in the coming months, due to its extreme efficiencies across GPUs and clusters. However, this new alliance is interesting, and combined with the hyperscalers consistently developing in-house specialized chips for model training and inferences, we will likely see a gradual decrease of market domination over the next 2-5 years. Overall, this seems like a BEARISH development for NVDA",0.5448,POSITIVE,0.9841

Bloomberg Again Reports on Semiconductors With Flimsy Information on Secret Government Contacts.csv,"Usually, when things that are leaked with an intention the entity where the leak comes from is pleased with said leak. Not for Bloomberg though. Bloomberg actually accomplishes citing an anonymous source about on ongoing discussions related to chip distribution and subsequently takes that information to the White House National Security Council to ask them to comment. Here is the WHNSC's response. Bloomberg: US Weighs Capping Exports of AI Chips From Nvidia and AMD to Some Countries A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the talks but pointed to a recent joint statement by the US and UAE on artificial intelligence. In it, the two countries acknowledged the “tremendous potential of AI for good,” as well as the “challenges and risks of this emerging technology and the vital importance of safeguards.” The council responds with a no comment while directing them to a positive statement. To me, this greatly diminishes whomever the Bloomberg contact is. This is the second time that Bloomberg goes out of their way citing a leaky government source that on it's own merits isn't really that sensational at all. The headline is sensational the reality is not. The approach would set a ceiling on export licenses for certain countries in the interest of national security, according to the people, who described the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Officials are focused on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing appetite for AI data centers and the deep pockets to fund them, the people said. This isn't even news. Reuters reported on this a month ago with a much more neutral to positive tone. Which it is. Reuters: US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia to data centers in the Middle East.Since October 2023, U.S. exporters have been required to obtain licenses before shipping advanced chips to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.Under the new rule, data centers will be able to apply for Validated End User status that will allow them to receive chips under a general authorization, rather than requiring their U.S. suppliers to obtain individual licenses to ship to them. If you're tracking, this simply seems to be the 2nd half of that original conversation. There are already chip restrictions. Nvidia is already not delivering the most advanced chips to those countries. The framework proposed would allow Nvidia to deliver chips under certain restrictions and guidelines. Bloomberg acknowledges this towards the tail end of the article. While officials have debated the best approach, they’ve slowed high-volume AI chip license approvals to the Middle East and elsewhere. But there are signs things could get moving soon: Under the new rules for shipments to data centers, US officials will vet and preapprove specific customers based on security commitments from both the companies and their national governments, paving the way for easier licensing down the road. What I don't understand is why does Bloomberg like to make things salacious when they're seemingly not. There is 0 chips to parts of the Middle-East today, but the U.S. government is working on a framework that may relieve that. Reuter story from a month ago. The end. When you read the headline one would believe that they are already selling these chips to the UAE and they're not.",0.5344,NEGATIVE,1.0

For the US and European AI Software Sector the restrictions should be regarded as good news, because with less systems being sold abroad, they won't have to wait that long for their orders. Further it keeps the foreign competition from getting faster AI chips. This poses a massive advantage for US and European AI Software Producers.

Could PLTR go on a TSLA-like Run (70%) if Included in SP500.csv,"On June 7th, S&P 500 is set to rebalance and Palantir will be eligible for the third time. With the spotlight on AI and Palantir's continued strong performance, there's a very high likelihood it is included in the S&P, which could lead PLTR going on a Tesla-like run. First, let me break down why Palantir is a great candidate for inclusion. Inclusion in the S&P 500 index involves meeting several stringent criteria related to market capitalization, liquidity, financial viability, and corporate governance. For Palantir Technologies (PLTR) to be considered a good candidate for S&P 500 inclusion, it must satisfy these key requirements: Market Capitalization: A company must have a market cap of at least $14.6 billion (as of 2023). Palantir's market capitalization has been above this threshold for a while. Liquidity: Companies need to have adequate liquidity, with a high trading volume. Palantir's shares are actively traded, reflecting strong investor interest and sufficient liquidity. Financial Viability: The company must report positive earnings in the most recent quarter and over the last four quarters combined. Palantir has demonstrated profitability, reporting positive GAAP EPS in recent quarters (InvestorPlace). U.S. Based: Companies must be U.S.-based, with the majority of their assets and revenues derived from the U.S. Palantir fits this criterion, being headquartered in Denver, Colorado, and deriving significant revenue from U.S. operations. Public Float: At least 50% of a company's shares must be in the public float. Palantir's public float percentage is adequate to meet this requirement, with substantial institutional ownership indicating wide distribution among public shareholders Palantir meets all the eligibility criteria, the only which could be a problem is corporate governance, ie, the insiders own a lot of shares of the company; however there are tons of examples of other companies that have a similar structure. As many of you know, Tesla went on a 70% in the weeks leading up to and the month following its inclusion. However, it's not alone. Many other ""sexy/high-profile"" names go on epic runs when SP500 inclusion is announced. Twitter (TWTR) Inclusion Date: June 7, 2018 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $26 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on May 21, 2018, Twitter's stock increased by approximately 14%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, Twitter's stock increased by about 5%. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2019 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2019, NXP's stock rose by approximately 10%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, NXP's stock increased by around 6%. AMD (Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.) (AMD) Inclusion Date: March 20, 2017 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $20 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2017, AMD's stock increased by approximately 12%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, AMD's stock rose by around 9%. T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS) Inclusion Date: June 22, 2020 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on June 5, 2020, T-Mobile's stock increased by approximately 8%. Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, T-Mobile's stock saw an increase of about 7%. NVIDIA (NVDA) Inclusion Date: November 18, 2001 Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $25 billion Performance: Weeks Leading to Inclusion: NVIDIA's stock saw a significant rise, roughly around 20-25%, in the weeks leading up to the inclusion. Month Following Inclusion: The stock continued to perform well, with an additional increase of around 10-15%. ""S&P 500 effect,"" is a real phenomenon and I think it's even more powerful with high-profile names like Palantir. As mentioned earlier, Tesla went on a god-like run in the weeks leading up to and after the announcement. And I think Palantir shares many characteristics with Tesla that may see it go on a similar run. Both companies have a very high-profile CEO. Alex Karp is loved by Palantir holders just like Elon is by Tesla fanboys, which leads to my most important point: retail ownership. Palantir has a significant amount of its shares outstanding owned by retail; if SP500 inclusion is announced and institutions have to buy shares it may create a similar move like Tesla's as most palantir fanboys won't sell. Like Tesla, they believe Palantir is changing the world (look at their subreddit). I think buying Palantir options is a great upside play with limited downside, depending on when you purchase your options. The inclusion announcement is on Friday after hours, so you could buy Friday before close or anytime this week and sell Monday morning if its not included for a minimum loss. And with options being so cheap, this could be a 50-bagger if it goes to 30 bucks. 6/21 23 C 6/21 25 C.",0.5557,POSITIVE,0.7174

See this article: https://www.wired.com/story/book-excerpt-science-of-ultra-pure-silicon/ The company, Unimin (parent company - Sibelco) has it's main production facility in Spruce Pine, North Carolina. Rumors indicate that the town has been wiped off the face of the Earth. https://x.com/FossilLocator/status/1840218595541778791 Production has been hauled for the foreseeable future.

How Terrifying is the Start of August.csv,"Just over the past three trading days, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 indices have all recorded their largest three-day cumulative decline since June 2022! Last night, the Nasdaq plummeted by over 6% at one point, and the S&P 500 dropped by more than 4%, with both indices returning to their early May levels by the close of trading. Although the major U.S. indices and individual stocks still closed with significant losses, the intraday declines were somewhat moderated. The primary reason for this was the release of the U.S. July ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, which rebounded from a four-year low in June to 51.4, exceeding market expectations and returning to the expansion zone above 50! Sub-indices, including the New Orders Index and Employment Index, also showed growth. Notably, the Employment Index reached 51.1, marking the largest increase since September of last year and the first time this year that it has entered the expansion zone above 50. This data slightly alleviated fears from last week's significant non-farm payroll decline, making the market believe that the drop in new jobs was primarily due to Hurricane Barry hitting Texas. 👉 As discussed previously, the sharp decline in U.S. stocks at the start of August stemmed from worries about the U.S. economy falling into recession. Therefore, when the ISM Non-Manufacturing number showed growth yesterday, it somewhat restored market confidence in the economy, helping to narrow the intraday losses of U.S. stocks. The U.S. stock market now needs to see positive economic growth news to recover, unlike before when everyone was hoping for bad news, anticipating a Federal Reserve interest rate cut! Hence, it is crucial to continue monitoring other economic data. If strong and robust growth numbers do not consistently appear, investors will remain concerned about an economic recession, and the trend of selling stocks for cash will not end. The VIX Fear Index is a crucial indicator to observe market sentiment calming down.

I wait all year for this opportunity - now I'm going to share it with you.csv,"If you trade long enough, you begin to see patterns emerge. On October 30th, one of my favorite patterns is starting. If you buy AMD stock on the last Monday of October, the average return for the rest of the year is 24.52%, and the stock is higher 88.89% of the time. This data starts in 2015 because it is the first full year after Dr. Lisa Su became CEO of AMD. Some of you may be wondering why this period is so strong for AMD stock. Let me share my personal theory. AMD depends on TSMC for chip manufacturing. Taiwan is protected by its geography and weather, but the Chinese have two windows of opportunity to cross the Strait with favorable weather. The first is from late March to the end of April. The second is from late September to late October. Last year, China launched major military exercises around Taiwan in April. This year, they did it in October, which just ended a few days ago. (They also launch these exercises when they are provoked, such as when Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan or during the recent Taiwanese elections.) In my view, the end of October triggers a relief rally in stocks related to TSMC, most notably AMD and Nvidia. This combines with earnings and strong seasonality, resulting in massive outperformance in a relatively short period of time. A quick word of warning—this time period includes earnings.

In INTC I trust.csv,"I've shifted my entire S&P 500 holdings into Intel, and here's why: The AI Revolution: NVIDIA currently dominates the AI technology landscape, and that’s indisputable. Their unmatched tech and visionary leadership have set the bar high. However, with the U.S. aiming to maintain its global leadership, relying on a single company for AI tech could become a security risk and a bottleneck in innovation. Why Intel Could Be the Game-Changer? Intel (INTC) is uniquely positioned to disrupt NVIDIA's monopoly. Alongside AMD, Intel possesses the expertise and resources needed to engineer AI chips. Enter Gaudi 3. If Gaudi 3 lives up to the hype, Intel’s stock could potentially skyrocket, doubling in value in a matter of months hands down. Government Backing: The U.S. government and major institutions are already showing their support for Intel, recognizing its strategic importance in the tech race. Positive Vibes: Reviews for Intel's Arrow Lake architecture are rolling in with strong positives, indicating that Intel's on the right track to regain dominance.

INTC - A dumb person's retrospective.csv,"I'm lazy and you regards don't like to read so I'll leave it to bullet points and you can piece them together. Intel was seen as a bargain in 2023 compared to NVDA and AMD after their 400% run up. US gov have vested interest in Intel. No they are not propping Intel up, but it's effectively giving Intel a big loan to buy a second house. That loan can pay off if the housing market goes up, or they are double fucked because they leveraged to buy a second house. If you bought Intel because china will invade Taiwan, you are really regarded. If China invades Taiwan, everything is going to sell. That's a disruption of global trade on WW2 levels. Your best case scenario still loses you money. Intel bullish scenario is 18A, High-Na EUV paying dividends, early experience granting them a year technological lead over TSMC. It doesn't have to work, but the upside is a 10x from these levels. TSMC pass up High NA EUV is repeating the same decision Intel did in 2012 when Intel controlled the market and did not view EUV as economically feasible. Again, doesn't mean TSMC is incorrect in their assessment, but history does repeat itself. Intel bearish scenario is just repeat of 2016 and delay after delay. In which case they head to legacy company status like Ford. Anyone else remember all the Ford bulls in 2016? They're not on this sub anymore because they all went broke. I'm no crayon guy.

The investment only somewhat paid off in 2018 when AMD traded to 30, but then half the regards lost everything (myself included) when it crashed to 18 in 2 months following Powell's rate hike. Look how quickly sentiment changed for AMD from 2018. This very well could be history repeating itself, as the semiconductor companies have demonstrated over and over again. Intel 18A is a repeat situation of AMD ZEN. The upside cannot be understated. I'm still bullish. Proper execution can bring the company to a $200+ stock.

Intel - Pinnacle of failure.csv,"Intel's Slippery Slope: Financial Woes, Investor Distrust, and Leadership Issues Intel Corporation, once a dominant force in the tech industry, is now grappling with a series of significant challenges that have fueled a troubling decline. Despite attempts to project a positive outlook, the company’s current trajectory suggests a troubling downward spiral. Financial Performance and Market Challenges Intel's financial performance has continued to deteriorate. For the first half of 2024, Intel reported revenues of $24 billion, marking a slight decrease compared to previous periods. This decline is occurring amid a broader tech sector recovery and highlights Intel’s struggle to maintain its competitive edge. The company's net income for this period was a mere $800 million, translating to a profit margin of approximately 3.3%, indicating substantial operational inefficiencies and intense competition from rivals such as AMD and NVIDIA. Declining Customer Satisfaction and Product Concerns Customer dissatisfaction remains a critical issue. The release of Intel's 14th Gen Core processors has not addressed the performance inconsistencies that plagued previous models. While the company has introduced new features, reviews suggest that these updates have not significantly improved reliability or performance compared to competitors. This ongoing issue is eroding customer trust and impacting market share. Eroding Investor Confidence Investor confidence in Intel is faltering. The recent involvement of Apollo Global Management has raised concerns, particularly following Apollo’s controversial investment decisions in other sectors. Additionally, a recent lawsuit filed by major institutional investors alleges mismanagement and failure to deliver on key performance promises. This legal battle has further shaken confidence, prompting several large investors to divest from Intel, exacerbating the company's financial strain. Leadership and Legal Troubles Intel's leadership is facing intense scrutiny. Recent high-profile exits, including the departure of several senior executives, have led to a perception of instability at the top. The company's reliance on legal strategies to address its challenges, rather than focusing on operational and strategic improvements, appears to be aggravatinh its difficulties. This reactive approach is not addressing the underlying issues affecting Intel’s performance. Future Prospects and Potential Downturn Intel’s future prospects remain uncertain. Despite a significant $15 billion R&D budget, the company’s progress in key areas like AI and autonomous driving lags behind that of its more agile competitors. Moreover, while short-term production issues in Taiwan have provided some temporary relief, these are unlikely to reverse the long-term downward trend. The competitive landscape continues to evolve rapidly, and Intel’s slower adaptation could hinder its recovery prospects. TL;DR Intel’s current strategy, which includes overhauling its product lineup and executive team, appears to be a desperate attempt to stabilize its position. For investors and stakeholders, the warning signs are clear: Intel’s challenges are substantial, and the company’s efforts to turn things around may not be sufficient in the face of ongoing and evolving issues.

Intel is a good buy.csv,"We are all well aware Intel is having it's own Boeing moment right now with design flaws in their CPUs and horrible customer service. They deserve the steaming pile dooky that is currently sitting atop their share value. That being said, they have an ace that may flip the entire market on it's head: They own their fabs. That's right: all the other big boys in town design and give their blueprints for TSMC to manufacture. That's true of AMD, Nvidia, and other ARM and mobile chip designers. Intel is the only large scale chip designers that is more or less vertically integrated. As you may know, they just got $8.8B from papa Biden to build more foundries in Ohio and Arizona, in addition to their other sites across the world. None of this is particularly noteworthy until you consider that China has always been very interested in Chinesing Taiwan, and are even more so now that they have been embargoed from Nvidia chips by the US. The Chinese military build-up over the past decade has focused heavily on amphibious warfare, and long range anti-naval weapons (think carrier buster ballistic/boost-glide stand off weapons.) It doesn't take a Ph.D in geopolitics to understand what the move is here. On the US/allied side, the discourse around Taiwan has slowly shifted: what started out as ""we have overwhelming force and we will stop any attempt at an invasion of Taiwan"" has become something like ""Maybe we can't stop them from invading, but we can make it a Pyrrhic victory"". This may actually be the case, but the trend is not great. You will have noticed Taiwan has been increasingly politically isolated, mirroring the growing Chinese military power in the region. So what happens to TSMC if Taiwan gets Chinesed? As you can imagine, China is interested in acquiring as many TSMC assets and personnel intact as possible. This means you can bet your degenerate bacon that US intelligence services have contingencies to extradite key scientists and engineers, and scuttle the production plants and machines before the Chinese can take control of them. But the result is easy to predict: no more TSMC. This means the personnel extradited will be used to advise and run US production plants owned by, you guessed it: Intel. Intel will have a quasi monopoly on chip manufacturing. The US government see this of course, that's why they are strongly nudging Nvidia to play nice with Intel, because they see a potential future where Intel is the only player in town capable of making Nvidia chips, or any consumer chips at all for that matter, in the West.

Intel is a pretty safe bet and are undervalued.csv,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: * Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. * Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV. * The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. * Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. * Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. * Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. * Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. * TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. * Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. * Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. * Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. *Intel lost Apple. *Intel has no phone chips. All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows: * Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4 * Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. * Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. * Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. * Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs). The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs. An additional benefit is that Intel can leverage their fabs in order to achieve higher margins for their own products. It's possible Intel's stock could be hit again in a month or so when their report comes out, but they are likely already at bottom.",0.5493,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Is INTC undervalued .csv,"Valuation Analysis of Intel Corporation Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has long been a key player in the semiconductor industry, but recent market developments and the rise of competitors like AMD and Nvidia have caused its stock to significantly underperform relative to its peers. As of Q2 2024, Intel’s total assets amount to approximately $182 billion, with liabilities around $91 billion, resulting in a net asset value of $91 billion. Yet, its market capitalization is around $95 billion, reflecting an almost 1:1 ratio between market cap and net assets. In contrast, competitors such as AMD and Nvidia trade at significantly higher premiums, indicating that the market may be underpricing Intel’s growth potential. Company Market Cap (Billion $) Net Assets (Billion $) Price to Net Asset Ratio Intel 95 91 1.04 AMD 266 56.5 4.71 Nvidia 3,000 58.15 51.58 Understanding Intel’s Valuation The Price to Net Asset Ratio (P/NAV) is a critical measure of how the market values a company relative to its net assets. Intel's current P/NAV of 1.04 reveals that its market value is nearly identical to its net assets, a valuation that appears surprisingly low, particularly when compared to its competitors. AMD and Nvidia, for instance, demonstrate P/NAV ratios of 4.71 and 51.58, respectively. This significant gap highlights the possibility that Intel is undervalued, especially given its strong fundamentals and growth potential. Several factors support this assessment. Despite facing fierce competition, Intel remains a leader in the semiconductor industry, known for its quality and innovation. The company is making substantial investments in new technologies and manufacturing capabilities, positioning itself to capitalize on growing trends such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, Intel boasts a robust balance sheet, with total assets of about $182 billion and liabilities around $91 billion. This financial strength provides a solid foundation for future growth and strategic initiatives. Although the recent decision to lay off 15,000 employees might seem concerning, it is part of a broader strategy to enhance operational efficiency and focus on core competencies, enabling Intel to adapt more effectively to evolving market demands. A key factor influencing Intel's future is the increasing global demand for semiconductors. As technology becomes more integrated into daily life, the need for high-performance chips continues to rise. Intel's resources and commitment to innovation position it to capture a larger share of this expanding market. Moreover, government support for the semiconductor industry adds another layer of potential upside for Intel. Given the strategic importance of semiconductor manufacturing in light of global supply chain challenges, particularly concerning the Taiwan-China situation, there is growing interest from government entities to bolster domestic semiconductor production. This focus on strengthening local supply chains can create favorable conditions for Intel, as it could receive both financial incentives and regulatory support to expand its operations and enhance its competitive positioning. Conclusion In summary, Intel Corporation is significantly undervalued based on its current P/NAV ratio. The company possesses strong assets, a history of innovation, and a strategic focus on future technologies. As Intel continues to execute its strategic plans and navigate market challenges, it has substantial potential to regain its competitive edge and achieve remarkable growth. Furthermore, the increasing government interest in supporting semiconductor manufacturing amid geopolitical uncertainties enhances Intel's prospects. The market's current valuation does not adequately reflect Intel's true value and growth potential, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

It's like saying my local grocery store doesn't use Nvidia chips. Emojis' don't need H100's.

Long-time AMD Holder (Cost Basis 1904) Starting to Sell - Anyone Else Disappointed in the Stock in 2.csv,"Wrote about my thinking below... Out of the 31 large banks, 25 have a “buy” rating and 6 have a “hold” rating on AMD 0.29%↑. It’s hard to think about why to sell when everyone is telling you to buy, but I am of the opinion that is when it should be most deeply considered. image credit to tipranks.com AMD has been my most profitable investment of the past 5 years, having risen 800% since purchased in August of 2018. For most investors (including myself), it’s difficult to part with winners. Not only that, I am someone who believes AI will proliferate throughout society in the coming years. Because they design data center GPUs, AMD should be one of the primary beneficiaries as the AI boom continues. It might seem counter-intuitive then to sell the stock here, but that is what I’ve begun doing over the past two weeks. I had high hopes for AMD this year, but it’s my view that they've failed to take significant data center GPU market share from Nvidia, and will have increased competition from Intel's new product offerings (on both client and data center), as well as proprietary silicon from large cloud players (Google, Amazon, etc). My original thesis was that AMD would profit from overextended Nvidia margins in 2024, but this underestimated the CUDA ecosystem moat that existed with Nvidia data center products (see Why I Got Nvidia Wrong). While most large cloud players want to diversify at least somewhat from Nvidia, they are still unable to do so without risking a competitive advantage with their own AI offerings. Add Intel into the mix, and the margin and market share pressure will be on AMD. The only player in the silicon value chain I think which can currently raise margins is TSMC (TSM 2.61%↑), but the geopolitical risk is too high for me to continue holding the stock (I sold my TSMC stake two weeks ago). On the PC (personal computer), Nvidia has always had a strong moat. It’s not just because they have the best performing products, but also because game developers are economically incentivized to optimize first (and often only) for the largest potential audience. This is similar to the moat CUDA protects on the data center side. One might think that Nvidia charging incredibly high prices for discrete graphics cards would cause them to lose share to AMD with consumers who directly purchase the products (as opposed to businesses who purchase the data center products). Yet Nvidia market share has only grown over the past few years. Data from Jon Peddie Research Why This Take Could Be Wrong: There is a lot of bullish momentum in the investor community around AMD currently from both professional commentators and retail investors (e.g. Twitter / X). Many people who had never heard of AMD 5 years ago are now saying to put money into the stock as it is Nvidia’s only pure AI competitor. As a result of this, AMD could see a dramatic rise on a positive earnings report later this month. In addition, I expect gaming revenues to surprise to the upside with the minor refresh of Xbox and Playstation consoles coming for holiday season. I still have ~260 shares of AMD remaining, and will likely hold to see if the stock jumps on the report. I think that AMD is extremely stretched in its current valuation (P/E of 205), and that any bad news could send it spiralling. Selling half of the remaining stake now is essentially a hedge against this possibility. Whatever happens with the earnings report, I will likely reduce my AMD holdings to zero in the next few months as I continue to lower exposure to companies reliant on Taiwan.",0.5591,NEGATIVE,0.9976

Wells Fargo ($WFC) must face a lawsuit over sham job interviews Rate Cut Countdown — Will the Fed Finally Pull the Trigger? Nope, the Fed isn’t cutting rates this week. But don’t snooze just yet—this meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn’t overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy—he's searching for that ""just right"" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same. Inflation: Cooling Off Inflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year’s 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the ""last mile"" of inflation reduction. The message? We’re on the right track, folks. Unemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it’s taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell’s recent take? The labor market isn’t adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a “sweet spot”—balancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals. Risk Management Reboot With inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed’s risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle—slightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed’s past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they’re determined to act promptly to avoid a recession. Some Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it’s time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn’t seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first. The Fed’s balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31. McDonald’s: The Golden Arches Stumble By the Numbers Revenue: $6.49 billion (missed $6.61 billion estimate) Earnings per Share: $2.97 (missed $3.07 estimate) Same-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020) U.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7% International Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1% International Franchised Sales: Down 1.3% McDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening. Value Meals to the Rescue The fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn’t translated into higher overall sales just yet. Internationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk. Defying the Odds Announcing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away. Despite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a ""buy"" and none recommending a sell. Looking Forward The golden arches are taking a ""forensic approach"" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales. So, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future. On The Horizon Tomorrow Economic Data and Earnings This week is buzzing with key economic data, especially on the employment front. Tomorrow, we'll get the June JOLTS report, which stands for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. This report measures job openings, hirings, and separations (like firings and retirements), offering a detailed snapshot of the U.S. job market. The May report surprised everyone with an unexpected increase in job openings, suggesting a stronger labor market. This might just be the signal the Fed needs to consider rate cuts sooner than expected. Earnings season is heating up, and the first of the Magnificent Seven stocks reports tomorrow after the close.

Microsoft’s Cloud Rain on Earnings Parade In a classic case of “so close, yet so far,” Microsoft ($MSFT) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, only to see its stock plummet over 5.79% in after-hours trading. Why? Investors fixated on the company’s disappointing Azure cloud revenue. Earnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints Microsoft’s revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure’s performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue—just shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub’s impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn’t enough to quell investor concerns. By the Numbers Revenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected Market Reaction and Future Outlook While the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft’s other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure’s growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn’t enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft’s shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500’s 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market’s laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters. Chips Ahoy! AMD’s Data Center Sales Surge 115% AMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let’s break it down. Earnings Breakdown AMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street’s expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter AI Chips and Data Center Dominance The tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company’s overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast. Other Segments and Market Reaction While the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD’s business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year AMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high. On The Horizon Tomorrow’s labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let’s be honest, they’re all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week’s job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes. Before Market Open Boeing ($BA): Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels.

My Analysis on ARM Holdings 2 Trillion+ Valuation.csv,"I believe ARM Holdings is slept on! I believe it could be the next NVIDIA. As of this writing its Market Cap is sitting at $142.36 Billion. I believe that its market cap should be ATLEAST 1 trillion due to the fact that it has an enormous market share of damn near if not more of 95% of the worlds smart device chips. What makes ARM unique is its business model. Their primary source of revenue is from the leasing of the design of the instruction set of computer chips. For those who dont know the instruction set is often referred to as an instruction set architecture (ISA), is a group of commands for a CPU in machine language. These commands tell the processor what operations to perform. Each instruction in the set specifies a particular operation to be performed on a specified set of data operands. The instruction set is fundamental to the design and functionality of computer chips, dictating how software communicates with hardware... So what is unique about this? Well I will tell you, these instruction sets are incredibly energy effecient compared to what is used currently for AI such as RISC or X86 etc. Currently NVIDIA is soaring because of the AI craze and its success has put light onto AMD, INTEL, SMCI etc but I believe ARM is a sleeper in my opinion. Their main source on revenue is through the royalties it recieves for leasing its designs. They can easily raise the royalty rate to increase their revenue stream anytime but there are some downsides. There customers could leave them and use other options. I dont think that is going to happen because lets face it their intellectual property is far better than any of the competition in terms of effeciency. AI is growing rapidly and one key expense is going to be energy consumption. Especially in these data centers. To my knowledge most data centers run on chips that use x86 from Intel. Those chips using that instruction set uses alot of energy. I believe data centers are looking to convert to a more energy effecient chip and when they do.... ENTER: ARM. Arm is currently used in almost all smart devices because again they are energy effecient. Why do we have longer battery life in a smart phones? Its because of ARM. What chips do electric cars use? ARM what instruction set does your microwave, fridge, washing machine use? ARM. Currently ARM is all over the portable device market but once they hit the data centers I believe there revenue is going to explode and therefore the market cap. There are major catalysts going down right now such as Microsoft partnering with them to make ARM based laptops and NVIDIA collaborating with them to make computers, not to mention that Tesla ordered a ton of NVIDIA chips that use ARM architecture. But my most bullish thing about ARM is what Jensen Huang said at Computex. He said that AI will eventually become physical in terms of robotics. Do you think those robotics need a energy sucker of a computerchip instruction set? No, the need the most energy effecient tech in todays age and that where ARM steps up right again. Currently we only use AI remotely (Chat GPT, Picture Generators, Etc.) but once we put AI into something physical and tangible such as robots to do everyday tasks those devices and robots need to run on the most advance and effecient software. I am currently looking at an outlook of 5-15 years and I am long on my position is this stock. We all seen what nvidia did and can only imagine what the next stock can yield the same returns and I think its ARM Holdings. Imagine going back to 2017 and investing into NVIDIA when the markect cap was the same as ARM now. Those returns look nice right if you have invested then. The time is now. Please keep in mind that i have not decided to go completely in depth of all of my research on ARM Holdings so please do your own. Also, I purposefully did not go into fundementals such as earnings and revenue on this. This is just my personal long term outlook on the research I have done. There are plenty more catalysts and risks out there so please DYOR. Feel free to comment!",0.5404,POSITIVE,0.9991

But here we are still FOMO'ing calls and short dated puts that would only print 1/1000 times. Over the past few days 3 mag 7 earnings all tanked and here we are. AMD? CPUs Good for gamers and graphics cards for poors. Pennies compared to $NVDA. $NVDA has a monopoly on AI software like $ASML has a monopoly on lithography and $TSM has a monopoly on chip production. $TSLA obviously seemingly doomed. Google can't take your cookies anymore, advertising revenue down MoM. Wanna get cucked by the zuck? I'm tempted to donate $1 to people wanting to buy $META calls at this point. TLDR: This looks like the same pattern we have had in 2022 and 2023 when markets take a downturn through mid-late October. Look at the previous years. I posted last week about the last 4 septembers being red. It looks like we are in another downturn. Earnings indicates it. I don't think CPI and PCE will save us this week. I'm scrounging up 25k waiting for the correction / dip / crash and buying SHARES so i never waste so much of my lifetime just to lose money speculating with options. Will post my realized losses if you think I'm BS. Thanks for reading this or just the TLDR. Looking forward to discussion!",0.5416,NEGATIVE,0.9998
My thesis on INTC going into 2025.csv,"I am going to add my technological and geopolitical fundamentals here, because I think these are going to be important factors heading into 2025. Disclaimer: I own 575 shares of Intel at an average PpS of $29.30 I think most analysts are forgetting that the next president is the same guy who is trying to block the acquisition of US steel by Nippon steel at all costs, regardless if it makes financial sense or not because he wants to retain as much American Manufacturing as possible and wants it to succeed. Most of the ""AI revolution"" has happened over the past 4 years where the administration had no problem letting foreign chip manufacturing take the lead. Intel is competing with TSMC, and TSMC receives massive subsidies and discounts from the Taiwanese government which dwarf the 7.9B (which was even reduced) from the US government. On top of that, the US government is also giving slightly less in subsidies, 6.6B, to TSMC to build in the US. So really, the current administration is not giving Intel an advantage over TSMC. The most effective thing that they could do is levy tariffs against Taiwan, which the next president has gone on record stating he wishes to do, instead of subsidies. This would increase demand for American chip manufacturing; while TSMC can manufacture in the US, CoWoS packaging is done outside of the US, in either Malaysia or Taiwan, and would cause the product to be subject to tariffs. In the chip design space, Intel is hopelessly behind on GPUs compared to Nvidia, and now Apple, Amazon, OpenAI and others are designing their own chips and using TSMC for manufacture. Intel still dominates the CPU space, but your average datacenter rack might have 10/20+ GPUs for each CPU. AMD is also a viable alternative to Intel for CPUs, and as such takes about 25% of the market. Intel's only way to compete in the GPU space is in the cost performance market, which mainly targets budget gaming, crypto mining, and cheap datacenter. The newest release of the ""Battlemage"" B580 is expected to compete with Nvidia's 4060 at the under $300 MSRP market, which are lofty goals. Nvidia and AMD still have offerings in these spaces but they are not lucrative ones. So Intel is basically competing to be a 3rd rate designer in the US, while they still have the CPU lead it matters a lot less for the lucrative markets right now. It's clear that on the design front, Intel is not going to receive much help to be successful. While this is their core business and majority of revenue, it is a business they are falling behind substantially compared to others. Design demand is GPUs and they are late to this party. Revenue for products is expected to stagnate or decline unless they have a competitive GPU offering. However, the US needs to have a domestic cutting edge chip manufacturing supply chain. It has expressed as much as a result of the 2022 supply chain shortage when we realized that letting TSMC manufacture 90% of the world's sub 5nm chips was a bad idea. That was the motivation behind passing the CHIPS act; Pat Gelsinger was instrumental in advising the current administration for this. The method for doing so has left a lot to be desired; Pat himself even expressed as much given the delay in fund disbursement, which in all fairness was only accelerated as a result of the election result and comments from republicans that they wanted to repeal the act. TSMC is not allowed to have the latest node fabricated in the US by law of the Taiwanese government. This is so that the country keeps its ""Silicon Shield"", the dependence globally to have manufacturing be done there which keeps Taiwan protected from China. But Intel has no such limitation. And TSMC is not able to fufill 100% of the orders for its customers; it is aggressively building more fabs to keep up with the ever increasing demand of AI. This demand exists for Intel to take part of. So, Intel in the next administration will have a tremendous amount of support for its Foundry, not Products, side of the business. This leaves Intel with a potential alternative to many of the scenarios analysts predict: It could solely dedicate to Foundry and sell off its Products division, most likely to AMD which shares the x86 architecture already and is solely focused on design. This would allow Intel to become a Foundry for external customers without having a conflict of interest, which I suspect is keeping them from customers. The CHIPS act stipulates that Intel has to retain a majority stake of Foundry but NOT Products, so this does not prevent Intel from dedicating itself to Foundry, which is what the US wants. I think Pat was waiting for the right climate to do this and it is coming soon. It is sad he did not stay long enough to see it happen. If Intel received the same amount of support from the US government that the Taiwanese government gave to TSMC, and was able to win external customers as a result of Tariffs, it could become the US TSMC. Much of this hinges on the 18A and later 14A nodes which are competitive with TSMC 2nm, which is the current cutting edge. But I think this is the desire of Intel and the next administration, and so they will work towards this goal. To diminish foundry would be a slow death for Intel. That is why I am still looking forward to Intel in 2025. If you got this far, thank you for reading. EDIT: Now that I think about it, it is also entirely possible for Qualcomm to buy Intel's Products division. I think they expressed as much earlier this year, but being they are primarily ARM I am not sure if it would be a good fit.",0.5359,NEGATIVE,0.9956

They think Amazon will overtake a 30 year CUDA industry software environment the entire world/industry has created THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AROUND). Go look up CUDA. It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four...

NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming Latest Sept 2025, with my guess, Jensen starts marketing from first half of 2025, and wider release commercially of NVDA CPU for 1st qtr of 2026, March, me thinks Jensen starts getting market ready all of 2025 for release in the wild September 2025 for retail user and full wider release by March 2026 / end of February 2026. Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?.. I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about.

Nearly every other chip designer abandoned fabs because businesses operate best when they focus on what they do best. Intel is unique in that it is set up to transform the business into a major foundry model going forward. That takes decades of investment which Intel is ahead on.

NVDA has been all the rage and justifiably so.csv,"Since NVDA reporter its Q1 2023 earnings, revealing huge demand for AI chips, the stock has surged to $3.3T. Revenues 4x, margins up expanded and everything seemed perfect. Bulls claimed the stock was getting cheaper to decelerating growth. Quarterly revenue growth has dropped from 88% to 34% to 18%, heading towards single digits. Next quarter we’ll see just 7%. All of the marginal buyers are in — sucking the last few retail buyers in with the lure of a split. History suggests short term bump after a split as we are seeing, but now institutional investors have a vast pool to distribute their shares in coming months. As the saying goes, “when the ducks are quacking, feed them.” If the quarterly revenue growth continues to moderate, earnings growth will be impacted as well — making the stock become more and more “expensive” (multiple screams higher) versus the theme of last year when the higher it climbed the “cheaper” it got. This does not change the fact that it is a great business with a great leader — which will play a role in the advance of AI technologies and productivity. It’s just going to be a heavy lift that it retains a perception of greater value than Amazon, Microsoft or the entire German Stock Market Capitalizations (where it trades now). NVDA is still a semiconductor company, which has never been a secular business — it’s cyclical. Always has been, always will be. As for 70% gross margins, as Bezos famously said, “your margin is my opportunity.” NVDA has not cured cancer. There will be more and more competition going forward. Intel’s Gaudi 3 is 50% faster than NVDA’s H100 and 40% more energy efficient. AMD is gunning for them.

And then we have a rich, a very aggressive cadence of Falcon Shores products following that. We also added the Gaudi 3 PC IE card to it, this use case of Xeon plus an accelerator or Gaudi accelerator is getting very good response from customers as well. So we'll be bringing that out later this year. But the real story is delivering the TCO value, delivering the enterprise use cases.

"NVDA will hit 5T market cap in 2026, and 10T market cap before 2032.csv","Hi regards, This is not a ""copium"" post about the recent stock price drops. I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest. The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY. First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"". Name Stock price EPS SP/EPS ratio AAPL 230 1,4 164 MSFT 413 2,95 140 AMD 145 0,16 1.035 META 516 5,16 100 AMZN 171 1,26 135 NVDA 116 0,68 170 As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price. But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list. AAPL Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits. How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new. But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more. MSFT They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are. They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy. They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office? AMD I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first. Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware. Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software. And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section. META They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value. ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS. AMZN The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL. NVDA AND OUR STAR CHILD. HOT TOPIC OF 2024. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company. Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?

Look at how long the dotcom bubble took, and more importantly, look how the late stage was characterized - explosion of IPOs. Until we get a flood of IPOs, we aren't in the late stage. Until we see an IPO for SexRobots Inc, we aren't in the late stage. At the moment we've got a handful of companies beating expectations because of AI revenue (good for Nvidia, long-term), and some beating CapEx expectations because of AI spending (good for Nvidia, short-term) The current situation Look at Nvidia P/E compared to its share price. We're halfway through the year. At the end of this fiscal year, Nvidia will be worth $180 at the midline of this trend. It is currently $113. That is a 57% return, 157% on an annualized basis. Nvidia is down 17% from its peak. Its hard to call the bottom, but yesterday we saw a major flash crash followed by a v back up. Much like the opposite of the ""blow-off"" tops that we see when the bull runs peak. Big volume selling, big volume buying. Big down, big up. I expect the fast bears used that to get out. The slow ones will watch their profits start eroding before also bailing and taking their gains. The slower ones will hit their stop losses, and the slowest will drift back into the red. If you're a bear in the green, take the W and get out Upcoming catalysts Other company earnings next week - MSFT, META, SNAP, AMD, ARM Upcoming earnings What are the market expectations for next earnings? They say they are expecting $0.59 per share. But last quarter Nvidia made that, on the back of 26B in revenue. For this quarter, Nvidia predicted 28B revenue. If they hit that, we're looking at $0.66. But of course they're being conservative. Why wouldn't they? When your growth is 262% you have plenty of room to estimate conservatively. How conservative are they usually? Last time they predicted 24B and hit 26B. If roughly that amount extra happens again, we're looking at 30B in revenue and $0.70 in profit.

NVIDIA (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang Points to 1 Trillion Opportunity for the Company.csv,"Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the next few weeks until the US election would be “confusing” for many since no one could say anything with conviction about who is going to be in the White House. Lee said that the market is going to trade “well” into the upcoming Fed meeting where he expects “some” rate cuts amid the labor market needing support and positive inflation data. Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said: However, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive. For this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that a trillion dollars’ worth of general-purpose data centers will inevitably transition to accelerated computing. “We’re in a computer revolution,” Huang said, pointing out that the first wave of data center modernization is driven by generative AI, which he described as more than just a tool—it’s a skill. Huang also emphasized the need for “densification,” with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) aiming to make data centers more efficient by compressing them into smaller spaces. He discussed NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it. Nvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia. Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave. At Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range. Of course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector. Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: Overall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings.

NVIDIA A Victim of Its Own Success.csv,"People wondering today why AVGO spiked but isn’t helping NVDA. In fact, there are now (idiotic) rumors that AVGO’s business booming is bad for NVDA. Just so you guys are aware, Broadcom competes with Mavel in specialized custom GPU chips (which cost, say $400-500 million a chip). NVDA competes with AMD (although AMD is like miles behind) in non-specialized GPU chips which come with software (CUDA), development assistance etc for companies. NVDA and Broadcom DO NOT directly compete. Broadcom is NOT a threat to NVDA’s business. However, NVDA can be a huge threat to Broadcom. If NVDA tells big tech they will produce custom chips for them, Broadcom’s business will take a MASSIVE hit. Broadcom cannot compete with NVDA or even AMD in the non-specialized GPU chips section because there’s a software lock in, logistics base etc that NVDA has already developed. Now, why is NVDA stock getting destroyed? Because it became too popular, and now trades so purely on swings in the market due to lots of retail traders etc, that good news barely moves it etc. There’s very little correlation. Expectations to NVDA now are so sky high—the expectation is that NVDA will always beat, so it’s hard for the stock to blow away expectations anymore. Compare that with Broadcom, which isn’t the most popular AI name (i.e. NVDA). That keeps overall sentiment much more tame for AVGO allowing it to blow out even though the quarter was mixed. If news came out tomorrow that Blackwell is selling like hot cakes, stock still wouldn’t move on it. NVDA’s stock has become a victim of its own success—of its popularity. When I invested in the stock in 2018, it acted much more rationally than the stock price does nowadays.

Nvidia The only problem you're gonna have is that you didn't sell more.csv,"Introduction Alright, so Nvidia is crazy overvalued right now. Just check out its P/E ratio – it's sitting at a whopping 73.94. And that's not all. Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.55, and the price-to-sales ratio is over 42. These numbers are way above what you typically see for tech stocks and the semiconductor industry. There are two big reasons why Nvidia's stock might take a hit: growing competition and lowered margins. Growing Competition First off, the competition is heating up big time. 🔥 AMD's MI300 series is a beast, merging CPU and GPU on the same chip, which is great for performance and energy efficiency. This is super important for data centers and AI applications, and it could seriously cut into Nvidia's market share. AMD is coming in hot, and Nvidia might end up feeling the burn. Then you've got Intel with their Gaudi3 GPU, which is packing some serious performance and efficiency for AI and machine learning tasks. More people might start switching to Intel's GPUs, giving Nvidia a run for its money. Intel's Gaudi3 could be the ghost in Nvidia's machine👻 Lowered Margins Then there's Amazon, which is throwing its hat into the ring with custom GPUs for their EC2 instances. These GPUs are optimized for machine learning and AI, and they integrate perfectly with Amazon's cloud services. This seamless integration could mean less reliance on Nvidia's products, pushing Nvidia to cut prices to stay competitive. Lower prices mean lower margins, which isn't great for Nvidia's bottom line. Amazon could very well turn Nvidia's margins into margin call memes. 📉 Adding to the heat, TSMC is thinking about jacking up production fees for Nvidia. The chairman's plans to raise prices could eat away at Nvidia's margins even more. If TSMC hikes those fees, Nvidia might have to dig deeper into their pockets, and that could be a real pain in the margins. 💸 Link (06/04) So yeah, Nvidia's stock might be flying high right now, but with all this competition and pressure on margins, it might not stay that way for long. It's looking like Nvidia might be headed from tendies to tears if they can't keep up. 😂 TL;DR Nvidia is trading high, but AMD, Intel, and Amazon are bringing the heat. 🔥 Competition + TSMC price hikes = potential margin squeeze. Stock might go from 🚀 to 💥 if they don't keep up. 😂",0.5456,NEGATIVE,0.9812
Nvidia's Blackwell Delay Offers Investors A Chance To 'Add To Positions' says Goldman Sachs.csv,"Nvidia Corp (NVDA) finds itself at the center of tech speculation as reports have surfaced about potential delays in its much-anticipated Blackwell architecture. With tech giants like Nvidia often facing the heat of public and market scrutiny, the slightest hiccup can stir investor unease. But is this delay really a cause for concern, or just a blip on Nvidia’s otherwise smooth journey towards AI supremacy? According to a report by The Information, Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell chips might hit a speed bump, delaying their release by over three months due to alleged design flaws. These chips were set to ship later this year, boasting promises of up to 30x better Inference performance over their predecessors. Despite this setback, Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs advises investors to remain calm and continue with their current strategies. The delay, while not ideal, is unlikely to impact Nvidia's 2025 earnings power or its market dominance, according to Hari. “We expect there to be little to no impact on CY2025 earnings and, most importantly, the company's long-term competitive position.” Hari believes that any short-term volatility in Nvidia's fundamentals will be just that—short-lived. The Market Reaction: Opportunity or Overreaction? For those ready to jump ship, Hari's advice is clear: stay the course. Nvidia's stock might experience some turbulence, but the company’s strong footing in the AI market isn't going anywhere. “We would consider any near-term dislocation in the stock as an opportunity to add to positions.” Despite a recent 15% correction, Nvidia remains a top pick, firmly seated on Goldman's Americas Conviction List with a 12-month price target of $135, suggesting a potential upside of nearly 26%. Even with Blackwell’s reported delays, Nvidia’s projected 39% year-over-year growth in 2025 remains unchanged. Hari’s bullish stance is rooted in Nvidia’s role as a crucial player in the rapidly evolving AI sector, especially as the demand for advanced AI infrastructure shows no signs of slowing down. Implications for Rival – AMD Interestingly, while the Blackwell delays might appear as a dark cloud over Nvidia, there could be a silver lining for competitors like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (AMD). “We believe the market could perceive this development as a marginal positive for AMD — the only alternative to Nvidia today in Data Center GPUs.” Although the analysts say AMD is unlikely to overtake Nvidia due to Nvidia’s strong market position and AMD’s challenges in scaling operations, this situation could still present a competitive boost for AMD. What’s Next for Nvidia? In the tech world, where speed and innovation reign supreme, a three-month delay might seem significant. However, Nvidia’s legacy of innovation and market leadership paints a different picture. As Hari points out, “any impact to CY2025 earnings will be negligible,” and the temporary setback should not deter investors from seeing Nvidia’s long-term value. For now, Nvidia’s strategy remains rock solid. The potential delay, whether factual or exaggerated, is but a temporary hurdle, according to Hari. As Nvidia navigates this challenge, the market watches closely, with many investors seeing a buying opportunity amid the noise. For those invested in Nvidia's future, Hari’s message is clear: hold steady, as the AI revolution waits for no one.",0.5505,NEGATIVE,0.9994
NVIDIA's share price surge and the outlook for the AI arithmetic market bubble risk and rational lay.csv,"As NVIDIA's share price has risen sharply in the short term, many have begun to wonder if the industry is facing a turning point or if there is a bubble. From the perspective of the industry giants, GPUs, as representatives of A1 arithmetic chips, are currently far from meeting demand. We can assume that AI applications are still only in their infancy, and there has not yet been a particularly prominent Al burst application in the world. Analyse the results: The AI market is still at an early stage: AI applications, despite explosive growth in recent years, are still at an early stage. The arithmetic power required for current AI applications (e.g., big language modelling, autonomous driving, robotics, etc.), especially GPUs, is still in the pre-burst stage. The growth of Tesla and the robotics industry, for example, predicts that billions of robots will be needed in the future for arithmetic support. This means that there is a huge potential for growth in AI arithmetic demand over the next few years, especially in inferential computing. GPUs as core hardware for AI: GPUs play a key role in AI inference computing, especially in tasks that require high parallel processing power (e.g., deep learning inference, autonomous driving, robot control, etc.). Although there are already many GPU products on the market, overall, the demand for AI computing power is still in a state of oversupply, and the size of the AI computing power market is likely to continue to expand, especially in the ‘reasoning’ segment of the demand for this segment is the area of high computation, especially in the field of automated driving, cloud computing and so on. Personal view: NVIDIA's leadership in the GPU space is well recognised, but many are beginning to worry about an industry bubble due to the short-term surge in its share price. NVIDIA's dominant position: Currently, NVIDIA is the almost unrivalled leader in the field of AI hardware (especially GPUs), and its products are widely used in AI training and reasoning calculations, especially playing a central role in large-scale data centres and cloud services. NVIDIA's rising share price reflects investors' optimistic expectations about the potential of the AI market. Bubble Risk: As NVIDIA's share price has surged, the market has become sceptical about whether it is overvalued. NVIDIA's high valuation could lead to the formation of a bubble, especially if its products and technologies are not sufficiently digested by the market. While the AI industry is promising, the market is volatile in the short term and the rise of competitors (e.g. AMD) could change the market landscape. Therefore, investors and industry observers need to be wary of market overheating and short-term speculation. Core view: US tech giants (e.g. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook) are supportive of NVIDIA's technology, but they will also support NVIDIA's competitors, such as AMD, in order to avoid the arithmetic market being monopolised by one company and to ensure the sustainable development of the industry. Analyse the results: Rational rather than short-term profit-driven: the behaviour of these tech giants suggests that they are not simply pursuing short-term profit when purchasing AI arithmetic, but are planning the security and sustainability of their own development in the long term. By supporting competitors such as AMD, these companies avoid the risk of the market becoming too dependent on NVIDIA alone, ensuring diversity in market competition and technological innovation. This kind of rational decision-making is crucial to the healthy development of the AI hardware market. If NVIDIA dominates the AI arithmetic market without competitive pressure, it could lead to overpricing, affecting the interests of other tech giants. As a result, companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon prefer to ensure diversity and healthy competition in the AI arithmetic market by supporting competitors such as AMD. In summary: future outlook and risks Huge potential for AI arithmetic: The demand for AI arithmetic is far from reaching its ceiling, especially in the area of inferential computing, and the market demand for GPUs will continue to grow as robotics and autonomous driving technologies evolve. The adoption of AI technologies will generate even more demand for arithmetic power in the coming decades, especially in emerging technologies such as robotics and autonomous driving. NVIDIA's dominance and risks: While NVIDIA's dominance in the AI hardware space cannot be ignored, the sharp rise in its share price and high market valuation have raised concerns about the existence of a bubble. Future technological competition, especially the rise of competitors such as AMD, may affect NVIDIA's market share. Long-term layout of industry giants: U.S. tech giants are very rational when investing in AI arithmetic, they will not simply pursue short-term benefits, but pay more attention to the diversity of the arithmetic market and the sustainability of the technology, to ensure that they can be invincible in the competition in the coming years. The AI arithmetic market is full of great potential, but is still in the early stages of development. While NVIDIA occupies a leading position in the AI hardware market, its high valuation and share price volatility also make the risk of a bubble",0.5575,POSITIVE,0.7135
NVIDIA’s next catalyst has to be sovereign AI.csv,"NVIDIA’s current valuation is not overtly expensive (FPER: 33, PEG: 1.61 according to FINVIZ) and the GPU orders for next year are all booked. Yet the stock is meeting strong resistance around $130. I think this is partially because a lot of people have been burned by CISCO during dot-com bubble and do not want to price in the future too much. But the real concern is that their revenue is almost entirely dependent on the rest of M7 and they are charging the big tech 80 % margin. The big tech, while being hammered by Wall Street for the increased CAPEX spending, indicated during last earning that they will not reduce their investment on AI. However, they did mention that they are/plan using their NPU (Google TPU, Tesla Dojo, AMD) to reduce the usage of NVIDIA GPU. Furthermore, GPT5 and Apple Intelligence should be available to the public by the end of this year. If these do not impress, the entire AI sector may see significant slowdown. But if GPT5 shows plateauing of performance while people find Apple Intelligence interesting, paradigm could shift toward smaller models and inference efficiency, again reducing the demand for NVIDIA. To justify significant increase in NVIDIA’s stock price, they need to show that they are not entirely dependent on the Big Tech. The only other potential buyers that have as much buying power are governments. Also, if the economy is going through downturns, governments have excuse to increase their spending. What I am paying attention to during the earning call is demonstration from NVIDIA that they are receiving significant demand from non-Big Tech such as governments.",0.5529,NEGATIVE,0.9994

Short Call Strategy Am I Regarded or Might This Actually Work.csv,"Okay, so I'm guessing a good amount of us in this subreddit were new to options trading at some point in time, and when we were just itty bitty option noobs first hearing about them, we just thought: "" Wow! this is just the same thing as betting on stocks but with leverage right?"" (might just be me when I first got into options trading but whatever). Moving on. I assume that many people's first instinct was to go and buy a call on a stock they were very bullish on. And I would assume that once we did that, we lost the entire position because we never knew how theta decay, IV, DTE, strike price, and other factors could sink your entire position. The thing about these factors is that when you buy a call, the majority of these factors are stacked against you, and if you don't want them to be completely stacked against you, you gotta pay up for a higher premium which is gonna yield the same or less of a return then the lower priced (but considerably more risky) options. You're paying for less risk. Long Calls are usually only profitable when the underlying has a significant enough uptick to outweigh all the other factors dragging down the value of the option. I'm sorry I don't mean to repeat the basics of valuing options but I think it's important to pretext them a little bit so my strategy makes more sense in the grand scheme of things. Okay, so my strategy is as follows: why buy a call, and have all of these factors stacked against you, when you can sell one, and have them work in your favor; I guess the whole basis is: the shittier the call, the better (meaning how likely it is to expire or be exercised with no value). The even better thing is we can magnify the shittiness to work in our favor on the sell side by selling balls deep out of the money calls, with low IV, and few DTE. And we can magnify this even further by selling calls on options with really shitty stocks underlying; stocks that are down 40% YTD, or just really, really stagnant not moving anywhere (might also get some sexy low IV to work in your favor there too). I don't really have any stocks in mind right now to lock this trade in off the top of my head, but $NOC and $AMD are quite down this last month and a half, and are relatively popular stocks. Like I said I need to find some better stocks for this Strat; these are not the ones I wanna go with, just what I thought of off the top of my head Now you might be saying two things: 1.

""What fucking moron is gonna be stupid enough to buy these calls?"". To answer question 1: Why not just sell more calls? And to answer question 2: I don't think I need to illustrate the stupidity of individuals in the market, but if you need me to, here you go: WSB regards (not dissing, I am also a WSB regard who has lost thousands on YOLOs), teenagers with a Robinhood account that just found out about options, and maybe even people who are legit investors, but have bought the call as a part of some bigger options play, like a straddle, or iron condor (not to mention that in the example of the straddle, I don't think they would really give a shit if the call tanked because, well, it's a straddle lol, the put on the other side would cover the losses and make profit{and yeah there are probably more plays where this is the case that I am just forgetting about, but this is the example I'm just gonna go with for now}). Not to mention markets are huge and I've checked the open interest on some of these calls and there are hundreds going up to the thousands in open interest on balls deep OTM, 2DTE, Low IV call options. Anyways, I guess the reason I made this post is to double check with some options veteran (I've been into options for a little less than a year, but I have some knowledge on them from my job) to see if this strategy is complete delusional manic retardation, or if there is actually some substance to it. I wanna make sure there isn't some variable or factor I'm not accounting for that could tank this entire play. If anyone could let me know, that would be much appreciated, thanks.",0.5298,NEGATIVE,0.9997

SMCI 1 day later.csv,"Hello fellow regards, Yesterday i had made a post on this subreddit about how SMCI is an undervalued stock, and that it is heavily involved in the future of AI, due to them supplying server systems to big companies such as AMD and Nvidia. I had also stated that the stock is undervalued, however, even though the stock had skyrocketed 12.5% today, i still strongly believe that the stock is still undervalued at $875 as it hit $960 a month ago and $1229 around march. The company also had stated that they want to supply 1000 liquid cooling racks per month, and increase their 1% market share to 15% within the next 12 months. This means that the stock has a lot of room for growth and i firmly believe that it can reach a market cap of $75 billion after its next ER, which would make the share price at around $1300. I am currently holding 10 shares right now, which is down from my 20 shares from yesterday as i had sold at $880.

SMCI loose analysis and opportunity simmering.csv,"SMCI golden age and beautiful chart. After hours Friday SMCI jumped almost 9 percent! Makes perfect sense that investors are flooding back into this stock! It has been so beaten down over the last six months by bad press and fears of fraud. Those fears have been quelled by a new CFO and auditing team. We just saw in the last month of 72% rally and there is still plenty of room to run on Monday it will open up around $48, the last critical level we saw was $49. Also, it looks like a somewhat sloppy cup and handle pattern is forming. My half baked technical analysis is. We will see a minor pull back around $50 to finish the pattern, then it will launch back up to the next critical level around $60 a share. Fundamentally speaking, they have been showing plenty of growth and demand for their products which mainly consists of hardware to House semiconductors, especially their trademark marked water cooled rack, which directly addresses a huge issue that centers are facing as computing power gets to Skynet levels. Their price to earnings ratio is a modest 21.9, the earnings per share is a humble 2, the ps ratio is 1.5 which is the lowest among its competitors. In fact all of its metrics or lowest amongst its competitors except for the EPS for AMD, which is 1.1. There will be much to see within the next quarterly earnings report and how they managed to address their auditing issues and reporting issues. But I think this company still has room to run and definitely has legs. I have 200 shares with plans to buy much more. I was going to buy on the next red day, expecting it to be Monday, but I digress. Next pull back I’m buying calls with a strike price of about $49-$55 exp in March. Even considering a YOLO.

"SMCI will skyrocket soon, DONT MISS OUT!.csv","So currently SMCI is around the $840 to $850 levels but hit $775 on monday. This meant that there is still a chance to buy SMCI while the shares are cheap right before they release their earnings in a month. The reason why im bullish on SMCI is because AI is driving the stock to skyrocket as they work alongside Nvidia and AMD in providing data centres.

Strong AI and Semiconductor weeks ahead.csv,"Hi all, I think that AI and esp. Semiconductor Stocks have a couple of strong weeks ahead. Starting on Tuesday, October 15th 2024, the Open Compute Project (OCP) global summit takes place in San Jose, California. Between 9 AM and 11:30 AM there'll be short keynotes (each 12 mins) presented by Meta, NVidia, AI Clusters, Intel, AMD, Microsoft and Google (full schedule here). Now, I don't think that there'll be any big surprises. But the Summit still presents an opportunity for public remarks about how strong the demand is or what so ever. Also, there's an article that says that Broadcom (AVGO) is going to show case cutting-edge AI infrastructure. Further it is expected that Taiwan Semiconductor Company (TSM) and ASML Holding (ASML) will publish their Q3 earnings next week. TSM will present its earnings on October 17th 2024 at 14:00 Taiwan time / 02:00 Eastern Time. So pre-market movements will most likely be wild on Thursday as a large part of the industry relies on TSM. If TSM reports a great Q3 revenue, this could push Nvidia over the current all time high. Also according to Moore's law is dead, the first RTX 5000 series GPUs are ready to be sold, but are not released because of business reasons (here at 22:22). So they could still change their mind and ship in Q4. Next, it is rumored (by moore's law is dead) that AMD will release a new CPU by the end of October or early November, the 9800X3D which is an 8 Core Gaming CPU with 3D cache and it is expected that it will be the fastest gaming CPU releasing this year. Although Client is not as important for AMD, it will still be beneficial to have this CPU released before the holiday season. Especially since Zen5 Rysen has so far been viewed as rather disappointing. Moore's law is dead also mentions an RX 7650 GRE GPU, which could launch alongside Ryzen 9800X3D. Releasing a slightly refreshed and cheap RDNA3 GPU could be a good move by AMD to get rid of RDNA3 stock ahead of the RDNA4 launch in 2025. Since the Ryzen 9800X3D has not yet been anounced, I don't think that it has been priced in and could give the stock a slight boost to recover from the -4% last Thursday. Also, I although Investors were not excited about AMDs Advancing AI event, I think AMDs position in the market is still solid. According to the slides shown at the event, AMD Epic has increased its market share to 34%. And according to tests AMD Epyc Turin obliterates Xeon 6 Granite Rapids, while being cheaper. Because of this, I think AMD is in a good position to gain more server market share. Further, the news about Nvidia Blackwell being sold out for the next 12 Months is not only good news for Nvidia but also for AMD. Sure, everyone wants blackwell. but if one can't get blackwell and if AMD Instinct MI325X is faster than Nvidia Hopper (H200), then they might be able to win over customers from nvidia, who would like to buy blackwell but can't in due time. Also, AMDs earnings should be reported on October 29 2024. Due to Ryzen Zen5 being disappointing and there being apparently a large RDNA3 stock remaining. If AMDs Instinct systems are selling well, this would also be good news for Micron Industries (MU), which produces high bandwith memory (HBM3e). And then there's Intel. Their newest releases seem to have been disappointing. But they claim to be making progress with their foundries.

They are frequently gamers, so they need to buy NVDA GPUs and AMD CPUs. They often buy these at AMZN. They buy YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, so they can skip the ads of their fellow influencers (GOOGL) They spent most of their waking hours at META's Instagram website. They drive a TSLA or RIVN. They're on the GLP-1 drug (LLY) to impress their SOs. They're churning their credit cards with AXP Platinum and Gold, JPM's Chase Sapphire Preffered (no, NOT Reserve), some younger ones need to rely on COF's Venture and Venture X cards that gave nice ""subs"". They use these cards frequently to eat out and earn those points at CMG, SHAK and SG. They're flying a lot on DAL, and they need their free wifi that is often sponsored by their preferred choice of mobile carrier, TMUS. To get to the airport they need to use UBER or LYFT, since they don't want to drive their sweet electric ride. When they arrive at their destination airport, they pick up their rental car, and of course they prefer AVIS (CAR), but their credit cards give them presential circle status on HTZ, so they are ok with that too. They check into their hotel room at Marriott (MAR) to impress their friends, but really they are using all their Chase points to book Hyatt (H) hotels. The slightly less premium young ones will have to go Hilton (HLT) and fly on UAL. They often booked all this travel on EXPE or BKNG. Sometimes they use ABNB. When they check in they need to get some food, so they use their DASH gift card they bought at COST every two weeks because they get 20% off. When they go to Vegas, they prefer to stay in WYNN, because it's where all the hot ones stay. After they're done with their holidaying which they do basically 4 months out of the year, they're going to ULTA or LULU to buy their beauty products or Khakis. They are drop shipping on SHOP and sometimes they need to use ZM to conduct ""business"" for their ""coaching classes"" that they teach. A lot of times they get paid using Venmo (PYPL).

"The next tech giant Why HOOD, PLTR and DKNG are the investment opportunities of a lifetime (Part 1).csv","I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong. $AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice. $NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were. And so in true wsb fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB. There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long. From a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about. And so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry : If you are under 40 years old, $HOOD (Finance), $PLTR (Defense) and $DKNG (gambling) will 100x during your investment horizon.

The short report for Intel (INTC) - A rabbit hole of CPU failures rate since 2022.csv,"Forenote: Im a technical person, A developer, this will be a technical DD to show how intel is failing to do their basic business model of manufacturing CPUs. Over the past month or so Intels customers have been becoming increasing irrate about CPUs just flat out dying after various finger pointing from Intel being debunked. I first caught wind of intels failures when a friends system started to become unstable, he would crash in games and sometimes doing mundane tasks. It all came to a clicking point when his systems files started becoming corrupted and he needed to attempt reinstalling windows. The attempts failed, windows couldnt even install without corrupted files, sometimes it would install and look fine, but running a verification shows that various system files were still corrupted but not important enough for the system to boot successfully. He would still get various crashes doing mundane things and gaming. It was basically a working brick at this point. So i got my research hat on, and discovered various reddit users on r/pcmasterrace were also reporting instability with their PCs. Not alot tho, this has been the wierd thing, Intel has such a large CPU failure rate, but not alot of reports which caught everyone by suprise. It started to make sense, the causes of the crashes were different for everything. Users were reporting issues with Nvidia, Issues with RAM, and issues with corrupted data. Obviously to any layman, these issues dont instantly point to an issue with the CPU. With GPU errors, Nvidia initially got heat, but Nvidia quickly debunked the issue reporting the GPUs that were returned were fully functional and had no issues. So I pulled out my handy dandy debug tools since my friend managed to get windows installed and it kinda runs. The first tests I ran were memory block verification. This validates that the memory is able to hold data immutably, after 4 hours the tests finished all green, the memory was stable and wasnt corrupting data. (its worth noting that the memory test software I used was very CPU lite so the CPU has little chance to corrupt the data its self, this is a stark difference to the Drive tests I ran.). Since my friend was getting corrupted files almost everytime he install anything, I ran the disk debug tools, these pull the S.M.A.R.T data from the drive and run various read and write tests. The S.M.A.R.T data came back green, the drive was reporting it had no errors or irregularies and was functioning fine, So i moved to the read and write tests, all red, the drive had a 90% file currption rate, I pulled the S.M.A.R.T data again, All green, the drive was still reporting it was functioning correctly. At this point, anyone would deduce they had a bad drive that was misbehaving, leading to the decreased number of CPU failure reports. After all, How can you say the CPU is bad when you have corrupt files? Many people forget how much the CPU is responsable for. When you read files or write files, its the CPU that tells the Drive what to store and where and what to read and where it is on the disk to read it from. and as i said, the software I used to test the drives is CPU intensive, it uses the the CPU to generate random data to store on the drive and hashes that data to verify it. So a bad CPU = Currupted data on the drive. Luckly my friend has 4 drives, So I told him to take out the ""bad"" drive and put in another one, I ran all my tests again and same result, the drive was reporting it was functional, but all the data was corrupted. The result was the same with all the drives tested. Now, this is a luxary many people dont have. Many people would get corrupted data on their drive and think the drive is dying and get a new one. However with 4 tests samples all failing the same way when days ago they were all fine is a very low chance. Now for the kicker, Intel has a tool to verify that the Intel CPU you have is a genuine Intel CPU, I guess intel has a problem of china making fake intel CPUs??? Ive never seen any but what the hell, its a useful tools since its does some basic CPU level checks. So i ran the verifier tool and its first test for a genuine CPU comes back green, Cool, it is a real Intel CPU. Memory test comes back green (We alreadt tested this soo good), next was the Graphics tests. Failed, the CPU was attempting to send data to the GPU and it corrupted the GPU memory. So now we have 2 symptoms. Disk data corruption GPU memory corruption My friend has Nvidia GPU and Nvidia previously debunked any issues with their GPUs. But we have a common cause, Intel CPUs are corrupting data when sending it to another device in the system (except RAM), Data sent to a disk gets corrupted and data sent to the GPU gets corrupted, which would explain the game crashes. Various other tests passed from boost speed changing, Wifi tests and math operations. After I finished all the tests and determed the issue is with the CPU, my friend RMA'd the CPU. This is where more troubles start. Intel refused the RMA, citing user damage, According to intel all the issues my friend was having was his fault and he caused the damage, After it was refused, I filed the RMA for him, to the same response, but because im a stickler I pushed for more info, Intel was refusing the RMA because of overclocking done by the motherboard. This is a previous blame game intel played, they were blaming Motherboards for putting in stock overclocks on CPUs causing them to fail, but this wasnt the case with my friend, his motherboard wasnt even stock overclocked, but intel refused it anyway. After this point is when the waterfall started coming down, a advanced tech-youtuber posted an exposé about intels CPU failures. See: Intel has a HUGE problem - Level1Tech the curtains were starting to fall, Apparently Game developers and datacenters (Intels BIGGEST customers) were getting large amounts of CPU failures specificly with intel CPUs. Now datacenters are normally quiet about this type of thing, opting to sort their issues directly with intel, but intel is turning away datacenters RMA's of thousands of CPUs, these datacenters has since publicly reported they are dropping intel systems from their products and only supporting AMD systems from now on. Intel has lost their largest customer base, because of their defective products and refusing to take responsability for the product inherit flaw. Intel is hoping this goes unnoticed, since reports are still low of CPUs failing because the errors are random and different each time and users dont know their CPU is defective, there isnt a big in your face ""The Intel CPU in this system has errored"" its always an error with something else, which is caused by the CPU. So intel is betting on customers blaming other manufactures like they did with Nvidia when this all started.

Edit: Ive received internal leaks from Intel employees explaining internal issues and intels failures. Source 1: The leading theory inside Intel right now, and it is just a theory, is that the Ring Bus is getting cooked because it's fed by the same rail as the P-Cores and E-Cores. Raptor Lake required incredibly high voltages that the clocks required to be competitive with Zen 4, and it seems like it was just pushed too hard. This is an inherent flaw that would be in Bartlett too it's overvolted. Meteor Lake isn't affected, and Emerald Rapids is unlikely be effected materially. Source 2: I never worked directly on Raptor Lake [Intel Design Engineer], but I did have exposure to Alder Lake, and I can confirm that they were very concerned about the ring bus getting damaged if the voltage was pushed too high. I can also confirm that Raptor Lake was rushed through the design and validation process... Source 3: I [Intel Foundry Services] can tell you that Raptor Lake was rushed through our Fab in Arizona in record time, but it's also produced in other fabs. However, this location (Arizona) is notable because I can confirm that there was an Oxidation issue caused by some failure in our HVAC system between March & June of 2023. It was so bad that Keyvan Esfarjani had to fly in to make decision about which wafers (which cost as much as a Model X each) needed to be thrown away. To be clear, I don't know what decision was made, but I do know that this event DID happen. And by the way, it affected Sapphire Rapids yields as well...although I doubt it's an issue that wasn't",0.5221,NEGATIVE,0.9929

RMA's are not cheap and the amount of money and time they are spending to fix the issue for existing chips while trying their hardest to deny RMAs for failed CPUs. Customers have lost faith in Intel, their chips are constantly beaten by AMD offerings and having a high failure rate really was the last nail in the coffin. Enterprise customers are switching, gamers are switching, datacetners are switching. All switching to AMD (or Arm - Yes Arm is starting to see some enterprise deployments, very little tho.)

VSH - The Forgotten King of Chips.csv,"TLDR: $VSH (Vishay Intertechnology) is printing money while everyone sleeps on it. $VSH just got the stamp of approval from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, confirming it as a hidden winner in Nvidia’s AI and RTX 50 supply chain. With key wins in MOSFETs, capacitors, and resistors, $VSH is now primed for explosive growth, riding Nvidia’s dominance in AI servers and GPUs. If you’re not jacked up on $VSH, you’re not meant to have money. Who is $VSH? Vishay Intertechnology is a veteran in the electronics industry. They make essential components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and semiconductors. You know, the boring stuff that makes your GPU, PS5, and electric toothbrush actually work. They’ve been doing this since 1962. That’s right, this company has survived every market downturn, bubble, and chip shortage in the last 60+ years. Meanwhile, you can’t even survive a red day on SPY. Why $VSH is printing money: Chips are everywhere—cars, phones, smart homes, AI servers. The global semiconductor market is growing at an insane pace (projected $1 trillion market by 2030). Guess what? Vishay is supplying the guts. Look at their P/E ratio: 12.5 (as of last check). Compare that to Nvidia’s 75+ or AMD’s 30-ish. $VSH is practically trading at the bargain bin, and yet their revenues are consistently strong. Vishay’s last earnings report crushed expectations, with double-digit growth in several segments. They’re sitting on $3.4B in annual revenue with plans to scale. Oh, and they’re buying back shares like they’re on clearance at Costco. Everyone’s hyped about Nvidia because of AI. Guess what? Vishay supplies components used in AI hardware, EV charging stations, and industrial automation. While Nvidia makes the sexy GPUs, Vishay sells the boring but essential resistors and capacitors that keep those GPUs from melting your motherboard. They’re eating up the market share. Recent Catalysts: Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo dropped a bombshell: Vishay is a key supplier for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI servers (GB200 series, DGX/HGX B200) and the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. These are Nvidia’s future bread-and-butter products, dominating AI and high-end gaming. Vishay replaced Infineon as Nvidia’s MOSFET supplier. Yes, Infineon, the semiconductor giant, just got sidelined. This Is MASSIVE for $VSH. Vishay is providing MOSFET/DrMOS (VRPower), vPolyTan (Polymer Tantalum Capacitors), and Current Shunt Resistors. These components are critical for Nvidia’s most cutting-edge products: • GB200 series AI servers: Nvidia’s next-gen AI infrastructure. • RTX 50 series GPUs: The next flagship graphics cards. Vishay’s vPolyTan capacitors (especially the T55 series) are already facing a supply crunch for 2025. That’s how in-demand they are. Kuo estimates that Vishay’s MOSFET production alone will contribute 20%-30% of revenue by 2025—with above-average gross profit margins. The vPolyTan capacitors will add a high single-digit percentage of revenue with significantly above-average margins. Translation? Vishay is printing money. Vishay’s production lines are already at capacity through 2025. When your biggest challenge is meeting demand, you’re in a good spot. Beyond Nvidia, Vishay is also poised to benefit from: • Automotive rebound: As EV production scales, Vishay’s components are critical. • IoT growth: Billions of devices mean billions of tiny components. Vishay is at the center of it. The Stock Is Still Cheap Even after today’s 7% jump to $18.35, $VSH is wildly undervalued. As I said earlier, the P/E ratio is still around 12-13, compared to Nvidia’s 75+. This is a company with real earnings, real dividends, and real growth potential. This is a great opportunity to make back everything you lost from your MSTR calls. Positions: Shares, 01/17/25 20C",0.5352,POSITIVE,0.9824

"Weekly jobless claims fall to 233,000, less than expected, in a positive sign for labor market.csv","Last night, the U.S. announced that the number of initial unemployment claims for last week was 233,000, significantly lower than the previous week's 249,000 and also below the market's expectation of 240,000! A few days ago, Mr. Wang mentioned that for the U.S. stock market to stop declining, the economic and labor data released must continue to be strong in order to ease concerns about a potential economic recession. Yesterday's sharp drop in initial unemployment claims marked the largest decrease in a year, indicating that the number of people recently unemployed has decreased. This alleviated the recession concerns raised by last Friday's non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate data, spurring a rally in U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 index surging over 2.3%, the largest single-day gain in 21 months 📈. On the other hand, the demand for the 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds at the auctions over the past two days was poor, causing the 10-year yield to exceed 4% once again! Tech giants saw a broad rebound, with Meta rising 4.2%, Alphabet up 1.9%, Amazon gaining 1.8%, Apple increasing 1.6%, and Microsoft rebounding 1%. Nvidia surged over 6%, returning to the $100 mark, leading to a rebound in semiconductor stocks. Broadcom, Micron, and Applied Materials all jumped more than 6%, while Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and AMD all saw gains of over 5%! Taiwan's ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) also rebounded, with TSMC and UMC both jumping more than 6%, and ASE gaining over 4%. However, it's still important to note that the number of continuing unemployment claims is rising, reaching its highest level since November 2021, nearly three years ago! Therefore, Wall Street's foreign investors remain concerned about the economy. For example, JPMorgan still believes the U.S. economy will enter a recession, raising the probability from 25% to 35%!

Why I am going long on Intel and letting Bad Daddy Gelsinger take me to Uranus - DD TurboNerd Post.csv,"TLDR: This stock fucking sucks, and I love it. But the developing foundry business is gonna get absolutely bananas under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for the sole purpose of developing it. They are not gonna let the other chip companies continue to take nut shots on them and they are just gonna make everyone chips for them. Anyways I all in on Mar 2025 Calls (which are like $4.50 - $5.00) right now. Here is some DD. Dog of the Dow Intel has lagged behind other chip titans such as [[AMD - AMD]] and [[NVDA -NVIDIA]] as they race to design and build chips to handle [[AI]] workloads. Both AMD and NVIDA have seen tremendous growth over the past 18 months (as of June 2024). A growth pattern that has gone completely unanswered by INTEL up until this point. Looking at the [[Price to Earnings Ratio]] of both AMD and NVIDIA it is easy to see how disconnected from earnings they have become (though they are both incredibly profitable). AMD P/E Ratio: 67.30 NVIDIA P/E Ratio: 238.53 INTEL P/E Ratio 31.79 AMD is wildly inflated relative to its competition in the space. NVDA is has a more ""sane"" price to earnings but it has also been nearly printing its own money with the amount of sales it has been making. The price of NVIDIA still ""feels"" high despite it's recent split. Another interesting metric to take a look at is the [[Price/Tangible Book]] - Where you take the current price of the stock and compare it to the tangle value of all its assets minus good will. AMD P/TB Ratio: 23.61 NVIDIA P/TB Ratio: 64.73 INTEL P/TB Ratio: 1.75 This says a few things; One either Intel has barely any assets worth liquidating relative to its stock price and the market has priced the stock appropriately, OR the price of the stock is selling for a very reasonable price related to the actual value of the company. This could be considered paying only .75 above book value of the company as a ""premium"" for future expected value. Source: Any trading platform that has data you ding dongs - go look it up. I got these from Schwab jfc. Technical Except for this past Wednesday, this company has been hard stuck around $30 after a selloff from its 52 week high of $51.28. 31.50 appears to be the most reliable resistance level we can work off of right now, then $32.50 after that. If it breaks both of those on a run up, there is literally no ceiling until $46. SO, you tell me what that means. The further you zoom out on your shitty little trading app the more you will see that this period we are in is nothing but consolidation. Foundry Intel's new foundry business will be the corner stone of its future growth. Forget the in house made chips. The company is not-so-silently tyring to be the American version of TSMC. Here is an article they posted on their own site outlining their model. https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-outlines-new-financial-reporting-structure.html#gs.a8z07s Note this section: April 9th 2024 ""Intel Foundry is a newly established operating segment that includes foundry technology development, foundry manufacturing and supply chain, and foundry services (formerly IFS). Under this new structure, Intel Foundry will recognize revenues generated from both external foundry customers and Intel Products..."" Fuck me, if they pull this off under #**Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger** who was basically hired for this specific function, this stock could easily moon. Not to mention this article detailing that NVIDIA will start using Intels Foundry to start making its own chips. https://www.techspot.com/news/101725-nvidia-turning-intel-foundry-services-expand-gpu-ai.html#:~:text=Nvidia%20could%20also%20choose%20to,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202024. Chips Act ""U.S. Department of Commerce has proposed up to $8.5 billion in direct funding through the CHIPS and Science Act to advance Intel’s commercial semiconductor projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon. Intel also expects to benefit from a U.S. Treasury Department Investment Tax Credit (ITC) of up to 25% on more than $100 billion in qualified investments and eligibility for federal loans up to $11 billion. Proposed funding supports Intel’s previously announced plans to invest more than $100 billion in the U.S. over five years to expand U.S. chipmaking capacity and capabilities critical to economic and national security and acceleration of emerging technologies, such as AI. Intel’s investments are expected to create more than 10,000 company jobs and nearly 20,000 construction jobs, and to support more than 50,000 indirect jobs with suppliers and supporting industries. "" https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/us-chips-act-intel-direct-funding.html#gs.a8z5ze So yea Intel is gonna get paid, and quite a bit. The article states that they are slated to receive up to $8.5 billion, with a B. X86 chips - Speculation With Arm taking dominance over portable computers like laptops, tablets and phones, X86 looks pretty boring. Except you have to remember that both AMD and Intel are still cranking these bad boys out like nobody's business. The raw horsepower in these for desktop workstations and servers is still not matched by ARM and probably wont be for quite a while. Sure they are not quite as power efficient, but who cares in a data center or major compute space anyways. Intel owns almost all of the IP for X86 processors too. AMD has a little bit and they have made improvements and designs of their own that they have been able to patent, but INTEL is the OG maker of these chips. Arm will probably continue to dominate the landscape, but they are the people who license their chips are going to need them made somewhere. They will have like two options. Intel or TSMC. China What happens when CHYNA pulls the trigger and takes over Taiwan. Where is everyone gonna have their chips made? Arizona, that's where. TSMC and Intel are both setting up MASSIVE Fabs there. So, when all the other chip companies get absolutely smoked I expect to see a giant green candle on that morning for INTC. I will probably write more later but this shit got way long way fast.

Why I bought Puts on MNST (Monster).csv,"Since Monster releases its earnings report after market, it’s time for some puts… or calls if you are based and want to inverse me Reason 1: High expectations - Current expectations for this quarterly are quite high.. Expected earnings per share are $0.452 as opposed to the $0.400 of a year ago . In this same light the market expects (has already priced in) a nearly 200 million dollar increase in revenue from the year prior.. Put quite simply these massive increases are already expected and priced in, and it’s much easier to fall short when expectations are this high Reason 2: Competition - PepsiCo is fighting hard for market share of the energy drink market and threw $550 million dollars for an 8.5% share of Celsius in 2022. Monster has already struggled to maintain market share versus Red Bull, which owns the largest portion of the energy drink market.. Now on top of this already stiff competition they have to deal with a whale like PepsiCo flooding the market with products like Rockstar and Celsius over time Reason 3: regulation- As more health focused initiatives take place in Europe and America, products like monster will face increased scrutiny, both from consumers and governments alike (regulations on certain contents). Reason 4: Even those who hit their goals have been getting smashed… AMD and Reddit- Now I get what you are thinking “what the heck do these companies have to do with monster”… and yea they have no direct relationship.. But even after surpassing their goals for this last quarter these companies have seen their value get smashed.. The market is being mad weird and bearish right now when it comes to earnings. So in essence this combined with reason 1 (the high goals they already have), means that I feel that the odds favor the Put/bear side Hope you enjoyed my presentation!!

"Why I think Intel is a Misunderstood, Undervalued Play – A Bet on 18A (+EV DD).csv","Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on yesterday’s post and explain why I think Intel ($INTC) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble. Now, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought. Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here? Let’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go? Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve. Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup. What’s 18A and why it matters Now, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years. Let me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made. The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value. Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now. The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around. The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood? Now let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach. Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better. What about Intel’s other businesses? Let’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets. The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever. Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel To wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble: The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value. Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging. The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in. The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival. The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel. This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it. I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking. TL;DR: Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.",0.5307,NEGATIVE,0.9997
Why Intel is the most undervalued tech stock right now.csv,"Intel ($INTC) is an insane bargain right now, as it is trading at year 1999 stock price. Every other comparable tech stock is up 5000%-20000% since then. People are too focused on Intel consumer and data center products, which by the way are improving at impressive rate. Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3). Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD & NVIDIA offerings. But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment. Currently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons. Microsoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in. If you are a big tech company and want the best, cutting edge silicon you will have to switch to Intel foundry sooner or later. Investing in Intel right now is like buying NVDA stock before the AI boom.",0.5689,NEGATIVE,0.9708

"YoY 56%, YTD 356% - Living at home changed my life.csv","TL;DR - Dad got cancer - so I went ham on investing I've been a long time lurker of this sub (and I never really post on reddit in general), but I didn't know where else to post this. I don't do options so maybe this is the wrong place lmao. I moved back home to my parents place when my dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Truthfully this has been the worst year of my life (and his obviously) in a lot of ways, but I've been investing since I was 16 (I'm 25 now). My dad worked in equities, so when he lost his ability to communicate effectively with me (and since I had significantly more income because I'm not paying rent) - I truthfully went ballistic on investing. Pretty much said fuck it, I'm living at home I don't need a 6 month emergency fund till I move out and went all-in. Granted 40% of my portfolio not listed here is in a 401k account entirely in the S&P 500 (set & forget just in case my equities went to hell as with the rest of my life lol). I believe in the margin of safety when investing. I like to invest in high-quality companies that generate lots of cash as the backbone of my portfolio. Since 2021 (before my dad got this cancer shit), I spoke with him and he basically said just look at the fundamentals of a company and invest in growth companies that you think will be around in 5-10 years. I look for value within growth stocks (i know paradoxical). Some of my icons in investing are David Tepper & Michael Burry. Again below is all my own experience and reflects only my own views and are not a recommendation of my company (corporate. disclaimer). My portfolio is heavily weighted (85%) between several stocks: AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL (So fucking cheap r u kidding me sorry), NVDA, AMZN, AMD, CRM, COST, RIVN (RIP), AVGO, VOO (ik not a stock) <-- I know semi(s) are very cyclical but i believe in holding all of these companies for 5-10 years, so I don't have to worry about temp. earnings beats/misses etc. Much easier to pick a stock and hold it for a while then it is to get the timing right. Roughly at 175% return in the past 3 years. (hammered META at $100's, NVDA at $200 both in 2022) Roughly 15% of my bets are moonshots (note the word bet hehe) with promise but objectively could be overvalued/bad investments: CCL/RCL (both are crushing it and between them own 75% of the cruise line market), LCID/RIVN (going to 0 bc they can't scale profitably or will make u a very happy person 3 years down the line bc R2/Atlas at 45k/50k should capture a significant portion of model y demand), TTD, DKNG/FLUT - gambling hasn't even been legalized in Cali/Texas (the biggest markets in the U.S. come on), RBLX (feels like betting against youtube in the early innings w/o realizing how much rev. they're actually recognizing), PYPL (value - cheap af (bought at $60) should turn around in a couple years) I joke I allocate like google's budget where it's 90% bread&butter and the rest are moonshots. Was very depressed (still reasonably depressed) because I'm not sure how much time my dad has. I hope in a way I can pass some of these stocks to my kid in a better place than I found it. I don't know I'm crying as I write this. Fuck my life. It is what it is. Gonna smoke a joint and drink a gin and tonic. Cheers",0.5396,NEGATIVE,1.0
