,"Back in August I managed to swing trade a couple thousand to 18k by playing AMD earnings and Palantir back in August. I was greedy and thought I couldn’t lose. I ended up yoloing 90% of my portfolio into HIMS and got absolutely reemed and that 18k vaporized into 3k. I was depressed, defeated, pissed. But most importantly this was a wake up call. No longer was I going to Yolo or invest in companies I didn’t believe in. I spent the next couple hours researching stocks on WSB and Stocktwits and discovered RKLB which was trading at around 4.00 at the time. I yolo’d my remaining 3k into 7.00 calls expiring in January 2025. The rest is history. I have learned from a lot of regards here about squandering life changing money (in particular the guy who went from 1k to 1 mill and soon to 0). Options was just a mean to come up quick.
