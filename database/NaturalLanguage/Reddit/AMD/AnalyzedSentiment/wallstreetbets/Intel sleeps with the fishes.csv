,,"They're so god awful behind and they can't possibly convince people needing or wanting to use a GPU product of why they should go with them over Green and Red and wallstreet keeps imagining that for some reason it will happen just because. It's literally eating them alive.I said it before, and to this day, AMD refuses to compete on the high end GPU market. The same shit show for Intel. While that strategy is sound at times for consumer it is a death sentence in the enterprise. They aren't looking for cheaper as there is so much space in those data centers. Do you want to fill racks with shit that you can't resell or practically give away or do you want the best you can get per square inch.I don't know how many times Jensen has to say it.

I wanted to sell the IBM $220/$225 call spread for a credit this morning but it didn‚Äôt fill for the price I wanted. Lots of opportunity, IBM is 2 standard deviations away from the mean in a rising channel, so it should come back in over the next couple of weeks. $MSFT should probably be bought in the $423 area, so I‚Äôve got orders in for the 11 Oct 430 calls. I‚Äôll probably sell them first though, and then reverse on any weakness. I knew they wouldn‚Äôt fill today even with the drop earlier, but I feel pretty confident that I‚Äôll get my fill tomorrow sometime if I sell today and then reverse.It was a good day.",3,0.526,0.997,NEGATIVE

,,"Love how everyone can say Intel is late to the AI party, yet AI is still in the first inning. Love how everyone says that Intel is dying when it's foundry burning Capex to catch up. Love how everyone says Intel needs to take drastic steps to turn around the company, and when they do so like cutting the dividend, everyone jumps ship.But most of all, love how everyone's been doom and gloom for 4 years when it takes years for the decisions 4 years ago to show. And now everyone all of a sudden wants to buy up Intel, the very same company everyone says has no value, is now being courted like The Bachelor. I hope Intel does not give up the ghost. If 18A cooks, they will grab huge market share from everyone else.Most people are regarded. Don't think like the herd. If everyone was right we'd all be rich.",0,0.552,0.98,POSITIVE

,,"I'll be honest I do see Intel being worth in the neighborhood of 120-180 in a year or two if 18A works. In addition to product value they will start to eat market share from TSMC. I see it being weighted much more towards that than product. That's why all the Capex is going to foundry and not product. Alot easier to compete with Asia than to compete with Nvidia, whom they want as a customer anyway.If they hadn't rested on laurels all this time, they would be worth 300+.",2,0.552,1.0,NEGATIVE
