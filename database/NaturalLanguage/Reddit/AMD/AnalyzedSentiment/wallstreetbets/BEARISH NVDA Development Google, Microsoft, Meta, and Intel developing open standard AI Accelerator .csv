This is pushing profit margins to extreme levels, protected by a moat defended by CUDA and their consistent R&D in the space, leading to further chip advancements along inference and power efficiencies at a much faster pace than their competitors (AMD/INTEL in particular). This new open standards alliance (UALink Promoter Group) for the interconnect (a.k.a backbone) of server clusters challenges NVDA's own proprietary interconnect systems, but will likely not be able to compete with the new B200 line being delivered in the coming months, due to its extreme efficiencies across GPUs and clusters. However, this new alliance is interesting, and combined with the hyperscalers consistently developing in-house specialized chips for model training and inferences, we will likely see a gradual decrease of market domination over the next 2-5 years.
