,"January 2024: market starts to price in anticipated 4-5 rate cuts in 2024. Tech moons. Small/Mid caps stagnant. for the first quarter you could make bank - i made 30k through march and withdrew that shit to pay for my kids school. April 2024: I am now a reformed bear continuing bull strategy from the first 6 weeks: S*P drop 5.4% through April 19 - higher than expected inflation date. Push rates higher, lower # of anticipated rate cuts. I got hammered trying the same call strategy. Gave away 15k if not more. May 2024: AI AI AI every time you say AI in your earnings call the price goes up $1. S&P up 5.96% June 2024: News Report: tech doesn't even need a rate cut to continue the bull run. June 12 $AAPL says ""APPLE INTELLIGENCE"", reaches all time highs. (puts for their earnings btw). $NVDA 140% for the year? After last year we were like WTF how is this 300 a share let alone 1400 a share in June. July 2024 $GOOG $AMZN up ~80-100% for the year. Look, its logical to take profits. No shame in that especially for retail who loses out 90% of the time. July 2024: Rate cuts like 99.999% almost certain for sept. Now suddenly Small/Mid caps rally in a massive sector rotation. $SPX/$NDX tanks. Next week: 1T outflows. Then they pump and dump the russel up 12% to 2022 highs and then sell off for a quick 6% while everyones FOMOing into $RUT. Maybe more like RUT RO!!!! I Fomo'd last of dry powder MOnday but after earnings I'm turning bearish. Tomorrow 5k realized loss for me or hold to 0. Too hard to beat the street. Profit taking, buying million dollar real estate with cash like smart investors do. Sit on the sidelines and let it bleed. But here we are still FOMO'ing calls and short dated puts that would only print 1/1000 times. Over the past few days 3 mag 7 earnings all tanked and here we are. AMD? CPUs Good for gamers and graphics cards for poors. Pennies compared to $NVDA. $NVDA has a monopoly on AI software like $ASML has a monopoly on lithography and $TSM has a monopoly on chip production. $TSLA obviously seemingly doomed. Google can't take your cookies anymore, advertising revenue down MoM. Wanna get cucked by the zuck? I'm tempted to donate $1 to people wanting to buy $META calls at this point. TLDR: This looks like the same pattern we have had in 2022 and 2023 when markets take a downturn through mid-late October. Look at the previous years. I posted last week about the last 4 septembers being red. It looks like we are in another downturn. Earnings indicates it. I don't think CPI and PCE will save us this week. I'm scrounging up 25k waiting for the correction / dip / crash and buying SHARES so i never waste so much of my lifetime just to lose money speculating with options. Will post my realized losses if you think I'm BS. Thanks for reading this or just the TLDR. Looking forward to discussion!",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE
