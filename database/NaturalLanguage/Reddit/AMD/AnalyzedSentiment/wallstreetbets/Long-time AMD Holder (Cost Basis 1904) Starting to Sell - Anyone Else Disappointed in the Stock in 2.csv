,"Wrote about my thinking below... Out of the 31 large banks, 25 have a “buy” rating and 6 have a “hold” rating on AMD 0.29%↑. It’s hard to think about why to sell when everyone is telling you to buy, but I am of the opinion that is when it should be most deeply considered. image credit to tipranks.com AMD has been my most profitable investment of the past 5 years, having risen 800% since purchased in August of 2018. For most investors (including myself), it’s difficult to part with winners. Not only that, I am someone who believes AI will proliferate throughout society in the coming years. Because they design data center GPUs, AMD should be one of the primary beneficiaries as the AI boom continues. It might seem counter-intuitive then to sell the stock here, but that is what I’ve begun doing over the past two weeks. I had high hopes for AMD this year, but it’s my view that they've failed to take significant data center GPU market share from Nvidia, and will have increased competition from Intel's new product offerings (on both client and data center), as well as proprietary silicon from large cloud players (Google, Amazon, etc). My original thesis was that AMD would profit from overextended Nvidia margins in 2024, but this underestimated the CUDA ecosystem moat that existed with Nvidia data center products (see Why I Got Nvidia Wrong). While most large cloud players want to diversify at least somewhat from Nvidia, they are still unable to do so without risking a competitive advantage with their own AI offerings. Add Intel into the mix, and the margin and market share pressure will be on AMD. The only player in the silicon value chain I think which can currently raise margins is TSMC (TSM 2.61%↑), but the geopolitical risk is too high for me to continue holding the stock (I sold my TSMC stake two weeks ago). On the PC (personal computer), Nvidia has always had a strong moat. It’s not just because they have the best performing products, but also because game developers are economically incentivized to optimize first (and often only) for the largest potential audience. This is similar to the moat CUDA protects on the data center side. One might think that Nvidia charging incredibly high prices for discrete graphics cards would cause them to lose share to AMD with consumers who directly purchase the products (as opposed to businesses who purchase the data center products). Yet Nvidia market share has only grown over the past few years. Data from Jon Peddie Research Why This Take Could Be Wrong: There is a lot of bullish momentum in the investor community around AMD currently from both professional commentators and retail investors (e.g. Twitter / X). Many people who had never heard of AMD 5 years ago are now saying to put money into the stock as it is Nvidia’s only pure AI competitor. As a result of this, AMD could see a dramatic rise on a positive earnings report later this month. In addition, I expect gaming revenues to surprise to the upside with the minor refresh of Xbox and Playstation consoles coming for holiday season. I still have ~260 shares of AMD remaining, and will likely hold to see if the stock jumps on the report. I think that AMD is extremely stretched in its current valuation (P/E of 205), and that any bad news could send it spiralling. Selling half of the remaining stake now is essentially a hedge against this possibility. Whatever happens with the earnings report, I will likely reduce my AMD holdings to zero in the next few months as I continue to lower exposure to companies reliant on Taiwan.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE
