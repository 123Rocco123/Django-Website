,"this is following a 15k loss in november, please any advice?","What you were doing wrong was buying weekly options.It's basically just gambling to try to predict the direction of a stock over the next few days.

,"this is following a 15k loss in november, please any advice?","Just do SOXS and SOXL calls instead. Once one pumps, buy some calls of the other. I‚Äôve found this to work. Semis are hitting a rough patch. A lot of upfront investment in expansion and conversion to newer processes with greater yield and slow growth in certain segment like renewables and automotive this year Data centers should continue to grow. Buy some companies that are making GaN and hold for a while. I like Navitas. A big guy will buy them eventually. Look into who‚Äôs making the power ic‚Äôs and FETs for power conversion. They‚Äôre gonna to keep growing. I like Onsemi (who should also benefit from any turbulence with China) Monolithic Power and Alpha Omega. Keep your eye on these guys.Tldr buy SOXL when semis are crashing and buy SOXS when semis are booming. Wait for the days where you see >=5% changes. And get out within a day or two when you go above 5%. The swings can be violent and quick. If you find. Good rhythm with it, maybe you‚Äôll be successful",0,0.535,NEGATIVE,1.0
