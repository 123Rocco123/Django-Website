,"Literally why. All metrics, performances and KPIs consistently met. Still flat YtD - when revenue up over 40÷. Punished for nothing",Right? I’d love a 5090 but I do “high end” shit so I can rationalize it after my wife nods disapprovingly but day in day out they make a rock solid product. NVIDIA takes the limelight but I’m thinking the glut of amd props on market will be less impacted by orange ass hats moves. NVIDIA demand will spike. Tariffs will eff it all up because Repubs don’t know any new tricks but screening trickle down and free markets. nV pullback was incoming and supply hits with inflation will leave little ol AMD chilling to meet demands. Sentiment will shift by end of 2025 because consumers don’t know 16gigs from 16cores so it’ll be a turtle but solid investment. Maybe even a good hedge once tariffs kick in. I legit don’t have shit in this one but I talked myself into it. I’m semi chubbing into it. Good talk.,1,0.536,POSITIVE,0.994

,"Literally why. All metrics, performances and KPIs consistently met. Still flat YtD - when revenue up over 40÷. Punished for nothing","Intel is a company that’s been around a long time, use to be at the peak of industry but just never really developed. Its stock price is reminiscent of that.
