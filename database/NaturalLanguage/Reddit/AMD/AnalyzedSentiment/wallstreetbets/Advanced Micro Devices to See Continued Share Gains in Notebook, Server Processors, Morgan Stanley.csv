,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is poised for continued share gains in notebook and server processors through 2025, according to Morgan Stanley's analysis of the company's product roadmap. Morgan Stanley anticipates that AMD's core business will ""accelerate meaningfully"" as the PC market continues to recover and server upgrades resume. The investment firm noted that AMD is likely to capture a disproportionate share of these larger projects as upgrades progress. AMD's increased Q3 revenue guidance of about $6.7 billion at the midpoint reflects ""strong momentum across compute businesses,"" according to Morgan Stanley. This momentum underscores the company's effective strategy and execution, positioning it well for sustained growth. Artificial intelligence is also expected to be a significant growth driver for AMD. The company's advancements in AI technology and its strategic roadmap place it in a favorable position to capitalize on the burgeoning AI market. While there are potential delays in the deployment of new AI silicon, the overall outlook remains robust. Morgan Stanley maintains an equal-weight rating on Advanced Micro Devices and has raised its price target to $178 from $176, reflecting confidence in the company's future performance. AMD's strategic positioning and continued execution of its roadmap suggest a promising trajectory. As the PC market recovers and server upgrades accelerate, AMD is well-positioned to capture a significant share of these markets, driving further growth and reinforcing its competitive edge in the industry.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE
