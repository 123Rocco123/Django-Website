This will push away many B2B sales Thoughts?","See my post above somewhere.The issue is often heat and heat management. Gaming laptops use miniaturized high performance PC parts, the parts generate a lot of heat.Heat management in laptops is difficult to begin with, and when you add those miniaturized high performance parts many laptop cases heat exchange design and fan arrangements are not adequate; and it's often critical to the longevity of a gaming laptop that you use it on a hard surface (like a desk, table, or laptop tray) where nothing is interfering with the air intake and heat exchange.Not surprisingly this is not how everyone uses a laptop. I know people (like my little brother) who will buy high end gaming laptops, then use them on the couch where the laptop is sitting directly on a lap, a pillow, a blanket, or the couch itself...And despite how often I warn them, they inevitably throw up their hands and says they have no idea why their computer keeps shutting itself off when they are trying to run every game at ultra settings for hours on end, nor can they figure out why they have had to replace their gaming laptops 3 times in 4 years.That's the problem.If you are a person who owns a gaming laptop that has a good case, and who uses it on a desk, a table or a hard surface tray/laptop stand, and does not attempt to overclock their CPU and run every game on the highest settings for hours on end, you may never ever encounter this problem.No gatekeeping here. I have a gaming desktop and laptop, because I too travel. There is absolutely nothing wrong with owning and enjoying a gaming laptop.Problems do present themselves though when a person does not understand how heat effects computers, or assumes:Heat management in that laptop is as good as a desktop; orA person thinks their high end gaming laptop can be used like a standard laptop or tablet.",5,0.514,0.992,NEGATIVE

This will push away many B2B sales Thoughts?","You keep telling me more and more specifically just how much you don't know about this market.Opening their fab to outside customers has everything to do with them potentially booming off enterprise products. That is literally all TSMC does is produce chips OTHER enterprise customers designed.If intel opens their fabs to other customers - then intel can have the shittiest in-house chip designs on the market, but if they're producing chips other companies designed - like Nvidia or tesla, or apple, or fuckall - they can still make money.If INTEL is the only company with a high-na EUV machine churning out advanced chips - and they open their fabs to outside customers - they may very well be the next company working with nvidia. TSMC isn't letting nvidia in on their most up to date technology - this is precisely why nvidia put out blackwell which is just two h100's connected at the ass.You don't know what it means to move goal posts. I have been talking about the same thing the whole goddam time - and that is how intel has the POTENTIAL.Look dude, I actually don't care if you understand this stuff or not.
