,nan,Sounds like just buy the dip.,1,0.551,NEGATIVE,0.8

,nan,"Their corny named ""AI"" series for mobile APU's got potential, and they've been slowing eating away at Intel OEM moat. Without knowing the price for their Strix Halo devices I just can't call how successful it will be.",2,0.536,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,NVIDIA has CUDA but AMD can run GGUF really well. If they can just boost VRAM they can become a real alternative in AI,2,0.584,POSITIVE,0.967

,nan,Load up while it's cheap. AMD is trading at just 18x 2026 earnings and 13x 2027 earnings.Their high margin data center revenue is up 122% YoY and taking over their declining segments like gaming. Data center went from 25% of total revenue to 50% in one year. You're going to see earnings explode moving forward.,0,0.575,NEGATIVE,1.0

,nan,What about in the next few weeks? Trying to plan my first options trade,1,0.538,NEGATIVE,0.992
,nan,I think Intel bouncing back and making up for it is a 5 year long move if they can survive. The pain isn't over yet.,3,0.577,POSITIVE,0.584
,nan,Companies that can't attract or retain talent very rarely move forward. Intel's problem is leadership based. Very hard to change a culture with bad leadership. Mostly because they'll never point the finger at themselves.,4,0.523,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"One of the reasons they aren't done hurting. Their shots at a comeback revolves around them being a US fab and benefiting during the Trump tariffs, and if Intel ould siege what AMD won't they could just make some VRAM SKU in the Battlemage series not for gamers but for the AI/ML community to start making open source contributuons and sneak their way past Nvidia's AI monopoly after a few years. Intel is more likely to get their GPU's supporting AI on the software side and AMD sure missed the mark to just make a VRAM dense GPU for everyone in LocalLLama and other ML subs despite sending a rep in to ask what people wanted to see over a year ago.",5,0.552,NEGATIVE,0.96
,nan,Isn’t 18x2026 and 13x2027 earnings way too much ?,1,0.546,NEGATIVE,0.993
,nan,If the share price goes nowhere in the next 36 months then AMD would have a trailing PE of 13x when something in the 35-40x range would be reasonable for a company with that kind of growth IMO.A lot of high growth semi stocks are trading at similar multiples or higher right now. I can see a situation where AMD share price triples in the next 36 months. A doubling of the share price looks like a very high probability outcome.Of course there are risks that AMD gets derailed on their growth trajectory or that investment in GenAI falters. The good thing is that AMD is diversified across all layers of computing and will continue to grow its data center and client side CPU segments regardless of AI GPUs.,2,0.578,NEGATIVE,0.996
,nan,"damn I bought at 176, sold at 140. it's at 130 now. I might buy back in after reading this.the only thing I'm worried about is they said they aren't gonna keep developing high end graphics cards. which means ML researchers are just going to completely abandon them.https://www.techpowerup.com/326415/amd-confirms-retreat-from-the-enthusiast-gpu-segment-to-focus-on-gaining-market-shareat this point though, maybe it doesn't matter what the fuck chips they put on those cards as long as they have VRAM",3,0.554,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,You're supposed to buy low and sell high.,4,0.553,NEGATIVE,0.983
,nan,Not on this sub you don't!!,5,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.995
,nan,I’m an ML researcher (applied scientist) and I can tell you we primarily train and serve models using data center GPUs (either in the cloud or on-prem). AMD is precisely focusing on the segment that serves ML researchers and that’s where the explosive growth is coming from.,4,0.53,POSITIVE,0.998
,nan,"Aren't they specifically lessening focus on high end gaming GPUs and focusing on high end computing cards?Isn't the money in servers/computing/AI, not gaming?",4,0.535,NEGATIVE,0.994
,nan,Bro is a time traveler from 2027,1,0.528,POSITIVE,1.0
,nan,"As a multi hundred billion dollar company there are tons of analysts that provide growth forecasts for the next few years. These are the average of all those forecasts.https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:AMD/explorer/pe_fwd/There are reasonable revenue growth assumptions that can be made based on current growth trajectory, expectations for product market growth, and market share. You can use revenue growth and profitability of their business to determine earnings potential.Obviously the further out you look the more assumptions are made and the higher likelihood of being significantly off. Right now their revenue growth is based on maintaining market share in a rapidly growing data center market. If data center CPU and GPU growth implodes for whatever reason then that would be a risk to these forecasts.",2,0.585,POSITIVE,0.905

,nan,I haven't followed semis closely lately. How much of a threat is the jump from x86 to arm for AMD?,0,0.549,NEGATIVE,0.995
,nan,"Difficult to say, x86 is more convenient overall. For AI arm might pickup some steam but it is still a bit too early to tell. The GH200 is quite peculiar.Worst case I am sure AMD can compete with their own ARM CPU if it comes to it, they have teams looking into it already",1,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.998
,nan,"Forgive my ignorance on the matter, but do you think a shift to ARM be inevitable for AMD?",2,0.564,NEGATIVE,0.885
,nan,"I don't think x86 needs to be replaced by ARM. Nvidia cannot add the features it needs to x86 that is why they are looking to ARM. Given Nvidia position it might boost ARM adoption a lot more.AMD can add all the features it needs to x86, so there is no need for AMD to switch unless a demand for it is created. Which Nvidia might be able to do.Ultimately it will boil down to if AMD and Intel are able to produce some.competition on the AI space to reduce the pressure to switch to ARM that Nvidia will apply.",3,0.562,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"I don’t think so. From my understanding, Nvidia developed the Grace CPU and NVLink C2C to optimize the data path between the host and device, particularly for use cases like UVM and compute offloading. The goal is to integrate host RAM more efficiently into the memory hierarchy. To achieve this, they needed control over the CPU architecture, which meant building their own CPU.They built their own CPU not because ARM is better. Sure, you could argue that ARM is better, but the reason they built their own CPU was that they needed one, not because ARM is better.In contrast, AMD already has a CPU lineup and Infinity Fabric for fast chip-to-chip interconnects. They can leverage their existing tech to achieve similar goals without needing to adopt ARM (they are doing this with x86 from what I know).",3,0.524,POSITIVE,0.915

,nan,It fucking baffles me that a company like Marvell with 10% of Intel’s revenue and essentially no earnings is now worth more,1,0.61,NEGATIVE,0.999
