Nvidias movement isnt based on how good the company is. you always sit in the corner crying looking for explanations when apple is down 1% on a random tuesday while shitystock is up 1.5%? no. thats just how it goes dude.you actually think the traders in Nvidia were like ""oh no 5% EPS beat, im gonna sell, I wanted 5.4%""?? dude no. the traders watch the stock move. and if it goes up they hold until they max their gains. but it didnt go up, so they sold and it tanked and more sold, then other bought because they thought it was a good deal, just like every day just with more people wanting short term money. thats why short term earnings plays are dumb and have always been a throw of the dice UNLESS(!!!) you know from some fun source or own research that they will announce something extraordinary. then go play.",2,0.542,1.0,NEGATIVE

I have a hard time seeing this drop being more than a blip when Blackwell is being rolled out and Nvidia is powering AI. It's just frustrating see AMD, the market as a whole up, Intel up over 4% while Nvidia is punished for having good earnings and beating expectations. Yes, I get it wasn't as much as it could've been but the point is this drop seems like an overreaction and a panic by new investors and people with options expiring just after earnings.","so, no one is saying it is a bad company and not a long term play.its dumping because previous calls were grand slam out of the park, and expectations were the same. they didnt deliver on that. yep, they beat but not enough to say holy shit thats incredible. some analysts were projecting over $35b in revenue, which would have been the holy crap scenario. post earnings movement was up 27% .it'll be choppy in the near term as folks that were looking for a quick hit run to other opportunities. that is what youre seeing now. before, dips were bought up. now,any run u is sold off.im curious if the $50b buyback is happening now to support the price action.i dont feel like now is not a good tie to buy shares or options (eyeing the 110p for 9/6 though). waiting for it to drop to closer to 110 which is possible after opex (as the hedging in shares is sold off back into the market, this will drive the price down in the very near term)",0,0.531,1.0,NEGATIVE

Whisper was 33MM on revenue and they came in at 32.8MM. The drop wasn’t dramatic because it beat the official estimates but it missed on the whispers. I think the setup was really a 7$ swing and it’s sitting at a 4$ swing nos. Up until now, NVDA has beat the estimate and beat the whisper.When you play earnings you need to pay attention to the whispers moreso than the official estimates.
