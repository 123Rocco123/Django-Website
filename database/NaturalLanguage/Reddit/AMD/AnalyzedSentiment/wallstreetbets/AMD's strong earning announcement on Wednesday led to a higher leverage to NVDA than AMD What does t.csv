,,"Probably a mixture of both. Microsoft says that it's spending, but is confident about the monetization. AMD is stating that they can't supply the surge in demand. The question is where is the priority at TSMC and the manufacturers that turn a chip into a system such as supermicro and dell. If you were supermicro and dell, where would you focus your energies? You can't build what you don't have and TSMC is making those NVDA chips.",1,0.54,0.999,NEGATIVE

NVDA doesn't have to guide that their AI hardware makes money for the companies attempting to develop and monetize services, no more than a drug dealer has to state that their drugs will make people richer. The drug dealer just needs to know that it is selling an addictive drug that everyone wants to try and that there is a demand.

,,NVDA hype ain't dead. Just taking a nap.,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE
,,"Based upon the comments by Apple, Google, Microsoft, and AMD, it's unlikely that NVDA is hype. Monetization of AI might be hype, much like Y2K was a lot of hype. However, the companies that were paid real money for the stuff related to Y2K benefitted greatly. It's a sweet gig(NVDA) to be the supplier of those that want to spend because of AI FOMO (almost all companies).",1,0.544,0.97,POSITIVE

,,"AMD specifically, stated that the supply of their AI chips are tight. This implies that the demand outstrips supply. The hardware side of AI is supply constrained. NVDA has a stronger supply chain and vendor base. Looks like the hardware side of this AI trade is still very hot for the foreseeable 6 months.As everyone is racing toward making AI profitable, they also have to rely on software side support. Unless AMD can get their hardware out there for the software engineers, the design and software development will be using the NVDA ecosystem. This further increases the NVDA moat for the foreseeable future. Because of AMD's comments as well as those of Apple and Google... my trade just shifted to a long term hold.",0,0.573,1.0,NEGATIVE
