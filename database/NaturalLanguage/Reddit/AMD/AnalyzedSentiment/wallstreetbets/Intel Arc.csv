Gaming GPUs isn't where the money is at.However, this shows that INTC is trying to get in the game and are marking efforts to be a GPU manufacturer. You have to start somewhere and where better to start than where NVDA started? Back in the 90s and early 00s it was Intel's world and AMD/NVDA were ants compared to INTC. AMD caught up and bought their way in GPUs via ATI acquisition. NVDA played the long con like crouching tiger while underplaying themselves and their market ""Oh we just make support hardware of hardcore gamers. This market isn't even worth going into. Might as well make dragon dildos specifically for the gluten sensitive.""I have INTC, but not NVDA or AMD. Feel like a clown. Still buying more INTC but I don't expect a turn around soon nor do I honestly expect INTC GPUs to really matter for the next 5 years. The way I see it is that INTC is really a 10-20 year game where you are buying it today hoping it will have NVDA style rocket to the moon type returns down the line in retirement (not saying it will. It could just end up like AT&T, Ford, BA, too-big-to-fail-banks, or the other ""strategically important enough for government bailouts, but becomes lazy trash due to the crutch"" kind of company). If you want a quick catchup or competitor to NVDA within 1-5 years it's not INTC but AMD, TSM, or just about anyone else.",1,0.544,1.0,NEGATIVE
