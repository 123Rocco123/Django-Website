,"Up nearly $10,000 on INTC in the last few days. I bought massively cheap shares on margin. I plan on owning this company for the long haul. I believe in the future of global semiconductor manufacturing and I can see Intel's place in the global semiconductor fabricator space. Nearly every other chip designer abandoned fabs because businesses operate best when they focus on what they do best. Intel is unique in that it is set up to transform the business into a major foundry model going forward. That takes decades of investment which Intel is ahead on. One day, Intel may fabricate chips for Nvidia, AMD, Texas Instruments, Apple, Qualcomm, and Microsoft. This is due to their potential leadership in silicon photonics and quantum computing. I wouldn't count Intel out just yet! 1.1 P/B ratio was really cheap, so I bought 2500 shares. I am paying down the margin with 95% of my wages. I have a feeling that I might be back to make another post (both gains and losses) relatively soon. Wish me luck!",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE
