,"Since Monster releases its earnings report after market, it’s time for some puts… or calls if you are based and want to inverse me Reason 1: High expectations - Current expectations for this quarterly are quite high.. Expected earnings per share are $0.452 as opposed to the $0.400 of a year ago . In this same light the market expects (has already priced in) a nearly 200 million dollar increase in revenue from the year prior.. Put quite simply these massive increases are already expected and priced in, and it’s much easier to fall short when expectations are this high Reason 2: Competition - PepsiCo is fighting hard for market share of the energy drink market and threw $550 million dollars for an 8.5% share of Celsius in 2022. Monster has already struggled to maintain market share versus Red Bull, which owns the largest portion of the energy drink market.. Now on top of this already stiff competition they have to deal with a whale like PepsiCo flooding the market with products like Rockstar and Celsius over time Reason 3: regulation- As more health focused initiatives take place in Europe and America, products like monster will face increased scrutiny, both from consumers and governments alike (regulations on certain contents). Reason 4: Even those who hit their goals have been getting smashed… AMD and Reddit- Now I get what you are thinking “what the heck do these companies have to do with monster”… and yea they have no direct relationship.. But even after surpassing their goals for this last quarter these companies have seen their value get smashed.. The market is being mad weird and bearish right now when it comes to earnings. So in essence this combined with reason 1 (the high goals they already have), means that I feel that the odds favor the Put/bear side Hope you enjoyed my presentation!!

,"Since Monster releases its earnings report after market, it’s time for some puts… or calls if you are based and want to inverse me Reason 1: High expectations - Current expectations for this quarterly are quite high.. Expected earnings per share are $0.452 as opposed to the $0.400 of a year ago . In this same light the market expects (has already priced in) a nearly 200 million dollar increase in revenue from the year prior.. Put quite simply these massive increases are already expected and priced in, and it’s much easier to fall short when expectations are this high Reason 2: Competition - PepsiCo is fighting hard for market share of the energy drink market and threw $550 million dollars for an 8.5% share of Celsius in 2022. Monster has already struggled to maintain market share versus Red Bull, which owns the largest portion of the energy drink market.. Now on top of this already stiff competition they have to deal with a whale like PepsiCo flooding the market with products like Rockstar and Celsius over time Reason 3: regulation- As more health focused initiatives take place in Europe and America, products like monster will face increased scrutiny, both from consumers and governments alike (regulations on certain contents). Reason 4: Even those who hit their goals have been getting smashed… AMD and Reddit- Now I get what you are thinking “what the heck do these companies have to do with monster”… and yea they have no direct relationship.. But even after surpassing their goals for this last quarter these companies have seen their value get smashed.. The market is being mad weird and bearish right now when it comes to earnings. So in essence this combined with reason 1 (the high goals they already have), means that I feel that the odds favor the Put/bear side Hope you enjoyed my presentation!! Wish you guys luck!!",That’s how it goes! 😂 ,2,0.503,0.992,POSITIVE
