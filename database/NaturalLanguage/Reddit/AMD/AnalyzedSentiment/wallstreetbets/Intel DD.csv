,"🚀INTC – Here's the DD You Need🚀 🚀 Summary Intel (INTC) is poised to skyrocket to $70-100 per share once they establish themselves as the go-to foundry. TSMC is slipping up and lagging in high-NA EUV. In 2-3 years, Intel's foundry business will be dominating. 🚀 The Catalyst: Intel's Foundry Push TSMC's Slip-Up: TSMC is behind on high-NA EUV tech, opening a huge window for Intel. Intel's Timeline: Expect Intel to capitalize on this in the next 2-3 years, becoming the top choice for chip manufacturing. 🚀 One API and Gaudi 3: The CUDA Killer One API Rollout: Intel’s One API, supported by big names like GOOG, Arm, Qcomm, and Samsung, is set to dethrone NVDA’s CUDA. Gaudi 3 vs H100: Intel’s Gaudi 3 will outperform NVDA's H100, making Intel the new favorite for AI acceleration and datacenters. CUDA’s Weakness: NVDA's market share is heavily reliant on CUDA. Once One API is fully rolled out, NVDA's grip on the market will loosen. 🚀 Competitive Advantage: Software Over Hardware The Software Edge: While anyone can build a good GPU, the real money is in the software ecosystem. Intel’s One API will give them a massive edge over AMD and NVDA. Market Perception: A lot of people underestimate Intel stock. They don't realize the potential they're holding. 🚀 Conclusion Intel is massively undervalued right now. With the impending dominance of their foundry business and the rollout of One API, INTC is set to soar. Don't miss out on this rocket ship to $70-100 per share. Get in now and thank me later. Disclosure: This is not financial advice. Do your own research. Current position: 42,000 shares Cost basis: $39 Will buy another 10k shares if it drops more.

,"🚀INTC – Here's the DD You Need🚀 🚀 Summary Intel (INTC) is poised to skyrocket to $70-100 per share once they establish themselves as the go-to foundry. TSMC is slipping up and lagging in high-NA EUV. In 2-3 years, Intel's foundry business will be dominating. 🚀 The Catalyst: Intel's Foundry Push TSMC's Slip-Up: TSMC is behind on high-NA EUV tech, opening a huge window for Intel. Intel's Timeline: Expect Intel to capitalize on this in the next 2-3 years, becoming the top choice for chip manufacturing. 🚀 One API and Gaudi 3: The CUDA Killer One API Rollout: Intel’s One API, supported by big names like GOOG, Arm, Qcomm, and Samsung, is set to dethrone NVDA’s CUDA. Gaudi 3 vs H100: Intel’s Gaudi 3 will outperform NVDA's H100, making Intel the new favorite for AI acceleration and datacenters. CUDA’s Weakness: NVDA's market share is heavily reliant on CUDA. Once One API is fully rolled out, NVDA's grip on the market will loosen. 🚀 Competitive Advantage: Software Over Hardware The Software Edge: While anyone can build a good GPU, the real money is in the software ecosystem. Intel’s One API will give them a massive edge over AMD and NVDA. Market Perception: A lot of people underestimate Intel stock. They don't realize the potential they're holding. 🚀 Conclusion Intel is massively undervalued right now.
