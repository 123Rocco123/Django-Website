Bloomberg: US Weighs Capping Exports of AI Chips From Nvidia and AMD to Some Countries A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the talks but pointed to a recent joint statement by the US and UAE on artificial intelligence.

Reuters: US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia to data centers in the Middle East.Since October 2023, U.S. exporters have been required to obtain licenses before shipping advanced chips to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.Under the new rule, data centers will be able to apply for Validated End User status that will allow them to receive chips under a general authorization, rather than requiring their U.S. suppliers to obtain individual licenses to ship to them. If you're tracking, this simply seems to be the 2nd half of that original conversation. There are already chip restrictions. Nvidia is already not delivering the most advanced chips to those countries. The framework proposed would allow Nvidia to deliver chips under certain restrictions and guidelines. Bloomberg acknowledges this towards the tail end of the article. While officials have debated the best approach, they’ve slowed high-volume AI chip license approvals to the Middle East and elsewhere. But there are signs things could get moving soon: Under the new rules for shipments to data centers, US officials will vet and preapprove specific customers based on security commitments from both the companies and their national governments, paving the way for easier licensing down the road.

,"Usually, when things that are leaked with an intention the entity where the leak comes from is pleased with said leak. Not for Bloomberg though. Bloomberg actually accomplishes citing an anonymous source about on ongoing discussions related to chip distribution and subsequently takes that information to the White House National Security Council to ask them to comment. Here is the WHNSC's response. Bloomberg: US Weighs Capping Exports of AI Chips From Nvidia and AMD to Some Countries A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the talks but pointed to a recent joint statement by the US and UAE on artificial intelligence. In it, the two countries acknowledged the “tremendous potential of AI for good,” as well as the “challenges and risks of this emerging technology and the vital importance of safeguards.” The council responds with a no comment while directing them to a positive statement. To me, this greatly diminishes whomever the Bloomberg contact is. This is the second time that Bloomberg goes out of their way citing a leaky government source that on it's own merits isn't really that sensational at all. The headline is sensational the reality is not. The approach would set a ceiling on export licenses for certain countries in the interest of national security, according to the people, who described the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Officials are focused on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing appetite for AI data centers and the deep pockets to fund them, the people said. This isn't even news. Reuters reported on this a month ago with a much more neutral to positive tone. Which it is. Reuters: US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia to data centers in the Middle East.Since October 2023, U.S. exporters have been required to obtain licenses before shipping advanced chips to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.Under the new rule, data centers will be able to apply for Validated End User status that will allow them to receive chips under a general authorization, rather than requiring their U.S. suppliers to obtain individual licenses to ship to them.
