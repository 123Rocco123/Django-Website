,"Since NVDA reporter its Q1 2023 earnings, revealing huge demand for AI chips, the stock has surged to $3.3T. Revenues 4x, margins up expanded and everything seemed perfect. Bulls claimed the stock was getting cheaper to decelerating growth. Quarterly revenue growth has dropped from 88% to 34% to 18%, heading towards single digits. Next quarter we’ll see just 7%. All of the marginal buyers are in — sucking the last few retail buyers in with the lure of a split. History suggests short term bump after a split as we are seeing, but now institutional investors have a vast pool to distribute their shares in coming months. As the saying goes, “when the ducks are quacking, feed them.” If the quarterly revenue growth continues to moderate, earnings growth will be impacted as well — making the stock become more and more “expensive” (multiple screams higher) versus the theme of last year when the higher it climbed the “cheaper” it got. This does not change the fact that it is a great business with a great leader — which will play a role in the advance of AI technologies and productivity. It’s just going to be a heavy lift that it retains a perception of greater value than Amazon, Microsoft or the entire German Stock Market Capitalizations (where it trades now). NVDA is still a semiconductor company, which has never been a secular business — it’s cyclical. Always has been, always will be. As for 70% gross margins, as Bezos famously said, “your margin is my opportunity.” NVDA has not cured cancer. There will be more and more competition going forward. Intel’s Gaudi 3 is 50% faster than NVDA’s H100 and 40% more energy efficient. AMD is gunning for them. The game is just beginning and NVDA will be forced to share the pie as no buyer wants to be beholden to one company. NVDA is a great company and will continue to innovate. We are in an AI/productivity revolution. I would never bet against it. However… “Price is what you pay, value is what you get…” Caveat emptor at these levels. What may go even higher in the short term can go a lot lower in a blink. The table is set When distribution to the great unwashed begins, keep in mind — in the wise words of Ernest Hemingway, “It occurs first very slowly, then all at once…” Thomas Hayes.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE
