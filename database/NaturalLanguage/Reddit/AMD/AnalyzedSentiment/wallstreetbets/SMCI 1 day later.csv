,"Hello fellow regards, Yesterday i had made a post on this subreddit about how SMCI is an undervalued stock, and that it is heavily involved in the future of AI, due to them supplying server systems to big companies such as AMD and Nvidia. I had also stated that the stock is undervalued, however, even though the stock had skyrocketed 12.5% today, i still strongly believe that the stock is still undervalued at $875 as it hit $960 a month ago and $1229 around march. The company also had stated that they want to supply 1000 liquid cooling racks per month, and increase their 1% market share to 15% within the next 12 months. This means that the stock has a lot of room for growth and i firmly believe that it can reach a market cap of $75 billion after its next ER, which would make the share price at around $1300. I am currently holding 10 shares right now, which is down from my 20 shares from yesterday as i had sold at $880. However, if it dips, i may buy more shares, but if it continues to rally, then i may hold onto the 10 shares i have as of right now.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE
