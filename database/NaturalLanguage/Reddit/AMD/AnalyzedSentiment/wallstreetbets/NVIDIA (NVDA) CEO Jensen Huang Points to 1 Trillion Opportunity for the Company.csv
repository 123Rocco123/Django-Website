,"Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the next few weeks until the US election would be “confusing” for many since no one could say anything with conviction about who is going to be in the White House. Lee said that the market is going to trade “well” into the upcoming Fed meeting where he expects “some” rate cuts amid the labor market needing support and positive inflation data. Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said: However, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive. For this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that a trillion dollars’ worth of general-purpose data centers will inevitably transition to accelerated computing. “We’re in a computer revolution,” Huang said, pointing out that the first wave of data center modernization is driven by generative AI, which he described as more than just a tool—it’s a skill. Huang also emphasized the need for “densification,” with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) aiming to make data centers more efficient by compressing them into smaller spaces. He discussed NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it. Nvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia. Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave. At Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range. Of course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.

,"Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the next few weeks until the US election would be “confusing” for many since no one could say anything with conviction about who is going to be in the White House. Lee said that the market is going to trade “well” into the upcoming Fed meeting where he expects “some” rate cuts amid the labor market needing support and positive inflation data. Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said: However, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive. For this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that a trillion dollars’ worth of general-purpose data centers will inevitably transition to accelerated computing. “We’re in a computer revolution,” Huang said, pointing out that the first wave of data center modernization is driven by generative AI, which he described as more than just a tool—it’s a skill. Huang also emphasized the need for “densification,” with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) aiming to make data centers more efficient by compressing them into smaller spaces. He discussed NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it. Nvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia. Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave. At Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range. Of course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple.
