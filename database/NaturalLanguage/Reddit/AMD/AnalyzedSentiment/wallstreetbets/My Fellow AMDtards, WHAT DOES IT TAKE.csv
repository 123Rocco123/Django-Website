Can they just start aggressively marketing their cool and oh so reliable products or mention AI somewhere PLEASE","It takes leadership and not being a fast following 2nd source supplier that lives off undercutting the ASP/margin of your main competitor. AMD's profit is basically mostly tax welfare they get.https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/1chp65t/amd_q1_gaap_earnings_visualized/Watching the big massive thick green rod that is NVDA's profit pisses me off since I have more than an insignificant amount on both NVDA and this ugly duckling that keeps coming up with regarded excuses to ""wait till next time for great news""... that's been the line for 10+ year.From a technical perspective they may have better products, but the fact its taking so long to drive the nail in INTC's coffin says it all in terms of failure of business model.They wait for their competitors to define the market, the tech, establish the standard (Wintel features, NVDA AI, etc... and then they duct tape in a cheaper drop in replacement so they don't have to invest in proper SW engineering, developer tool-chain, training future grads, etc...It will take a business philosophy change, they should stop defining ""success"" as being 2nd fiddle and letting others take them for a ride.As Jensen put in in their last earnings call: ""In the markets we are in, being first matters""",0,0.551,1.0,NEGATIVE

Can they just start aggressively marketing their cool and oh so reliable products or mention AI somewhere PLEASE",AMD fails to win market trust and doesn't demonstrate ability to succeed in such a high demand market to deliver solutions that can scale.AMD is struggling to improve their MI300 supply. They are struggling with networking. Nvidia provides a single rack as well and hundreds of racks networked solutions. Nvidia is already in mature state to provide software solutions once their devices are racked and stacked in a datacenter. Meanwhile AMD only does cute demos with few MI300. AMD has partnered with MSFT and META but so far neither of them have openly expressed interest to buy more MI300 or MI325 or MI300 solutions in future.
