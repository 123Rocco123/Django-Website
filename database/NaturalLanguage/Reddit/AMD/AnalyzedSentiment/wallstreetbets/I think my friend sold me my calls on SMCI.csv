,"I swear on my mother’s eyes. I’m sitting there like a fing genius looking at my hood gambling account, staring at the SMCI chart and reading all this bullshit regards are spewing on twitter about the stock getting delisted. Luckly, I just came out of a similar trade on B.Riley and kinda figured if those frauds can get away with not filing financials on time for over 180 days and they are still trading, there is no way SMCI will get delisted. I buy 250 $34.5 strike weekly calls on SMCI at $0.50 a pop. That’s a ~$12,500, baby position babbyyy. Why $34.5 calls? idk whats funnier than $34? $34.5. Also I looked at where it dropped when EY announced they wouldn't proceed as their auditors amd $34.5 is about the level they closed at that day. Finally, $34.5 is within my personal risk tolerance. guh Today, I’m minding my own business, scrolling Reddit, eating a sandwich, watching Ana De Armas AI Porn, minding my own business. My phone buzzes, and it’s my buddy. This guy texts me out of nowhere, “Man, I think I’m fucked. I sold $34.5 naked calls on SMCI this week. Thought it’d be easy money.” So I’m like, waiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.. I check my broker app and look at the open interest on these contracts, and my jaw hits the goddamn floor. The open interest is 257. lol. 257 contracts, and your boy here owns 250 of them. I’m the goddamn other side of his trade! I'm the guy that said yuuuuuuuuuup I'll take those off your hands sir. If everything holds up and SMCI opens strong tomorrow, this guy is about to be bent over a financial barrel, down 500% at open (das what the app is saying rn at least). He thought he was playing it safe, slinging naked calls like he’s DFV or something, and now he’s unknowingly writing me a fat f***ing check for $62,000 (so far). He knows I bought SMCI calls. I mentioned it in passing, like, “Yeah, I’m in on SMCI this week.” But he doesn’t know how many or what strike. I didn’t tell him I went full-blown degenerate with $12.5K on a strike so far out of the money. Now I’m sitting here, “Do I tell him?” Like, “Hey bro, funny story, you’re about to owe me your next three paychecks because I’m holding all the cards—and by cards, I mean your fuckiing calls.” Or do I keep my mouth shut and let the market gods do what they do? I feel bad, but not that bad, you know? Trading is a tough game isn't it? No mercy. So that’s where I'm going to hold a little past open and then I’m cashing in big-time, and he’s gonna be selling plasma to cover his losses. What would you guys do? Do I come clean, or let him find out the hard way? Either way, I’m buying a steak dinner tomorrow. Maybe I’ll even let him smell it. Also a hooker.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

I buy 250 $34.5 strike weekly calls on SMCI at $0.50 a pop. That’s a ~$12,500, baby position babbyyy. Why $34.5 calls? idk whats funnier than $34? $34.5.

I’m sitting there like a fing genius looking at my hood gambling account, staring at the SMCI chart and reading all this bullshit regards are spewing on twitter about the stock getting delisted. Luckly, I just came out of a similar trade on B.Riley and kinda figured if those frauds can get away with not filing financials on time for over 180 days and they are still trading, there is no way SMCI will get delisted. I buy 250 $34.5 strike weekly calls on SMCI at $0.50 a pop. That’s a ~$12,500, baby position babbyyy. Why $34.5 calls? idk whats funnier than $34? $34.5. Also I looked at where it dropped when EY announced they wouldn't proceed as their auditors amd $34.5 is about the level they closed at that day. Finally, $34.5 is within my personal risk tolerance. guh Today, I’m minding my own business, scrolling Reddit, eating a sandwich, watching Ana De Armas AI Porn, minding my own business.

The open interest is 257. lol. 257 contracts, and your boy here owns 250 of them. I’m the goddamn other side of his trade! I'm the guy that said yuuuuuuuuuup I'll take those off your hands sir. If everything holds up and SMCI opens strong tomorrow, this guy is about to be bent over a financial barrel, down 500% at open (das what the app is saying rn at least). He thought he was playing it safe, slinging naked calls like he’s DFV or something, and now he’s unknowingly writing me a fat f***ing check for $62,000 (so far). He knows I bought SMCI calls. I mentioned it in passing, like, “Yeah, I’m in on SMCI this week.” But he doesn’t know how many or what strike. I didn’t tell him I went full-blown degenerate with $12.5K on a strike so far out of the money. Now I’m sitting here, “Do I tell him?” Like, “Hey bro, funny story, you’re about to owe me your next three paychecks because I’m holding all the cards—and by cards, I mean your fuckiing calls.” Or do I keep my mouth shut and let the market gods do what they do? I feel bad, but not that bad, you know? Trading is a tough game isn't it? No mercy. So that’s where I'm going to hold a little past open and then I’m cashing in big-time, and he’s gonna be selling plasma to cover his losses. What would you guys do? Do I come clean, or let him find out the hard way? Either way, I’m buying a steak dinner tomorrow. Maybe I’ll even let him smell it.

I buy 250 $34.5 strike weekly calls on SMCI at $0.50 a pop. That’s a ~$12,500, baby position babbyyy. Why $34.5 calls? idk whats funnier than $34? $34.5.

Finally, $34.5 is within my personal risk tolerance. guh Today, I’m minding my own business, scrolling Reddit, eating a sandwich, watching Ana De Armas AI Porn, minding my own business. My phone buzzes, and it’s my buddy. This guy texts me out of nowhere, “Man, I think I’m fucked. I sold $34.5 naked calls on SMCI this week. Thought it’d be easy money.” So I’m like, waiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.. I check my broker app and look at the open interest on these contracts, and my jaw hits the goddamn floor. The open interest is 257. lol. 257 contracts, and your boy here owns 250 of them. I’m the goddamn other side of his trade! I'm the guy that said yuuuuuuuuuup I'll take those off your hands sir. If everything holds up and SMCI opens strong tomorrow, this guy is about to be bent over a financial barrel, down 500% at open (das what the app is saying rn at least). He thought he was playing it safe, slinging naked calls like he’s DFV or something, and now he’s unknowingly writing me a fat f***ing check for $62,000 (so far). He knows I bought SMCI calls. I mentioned it in passing, like, “Yeah, I’m in on SMCI this week.” But he doesn’t know how many or what strike. I didn’t tell him I went full-blown degenerate with $12.5K on a strike so far out of the money. Now I’m sitting here, “Do I tell him?” Like, “Hey bro, funny story, you’re about to owe me your next three paychecks because I’m holding all the cards—and by cards, I mean your fuckiing calls.” Or do I keep my mouth shut and let the market gods do what they do? I feel bad, but not that bad, you know? Trading is a tough game isn't it? No mercy. So that’s where I'm going to hold a little past open and then I’m cashing in big-time, and he’s gonna be selling plasma to cover his losses. What would you guys do? Do I come clean, or let him find out the hard way? Either way, I’m buying a steak dinner tomorrow. Maybe I’ll even let him smell it. Also a hooker.",What site do you use for Ana De Armas AI porn?
