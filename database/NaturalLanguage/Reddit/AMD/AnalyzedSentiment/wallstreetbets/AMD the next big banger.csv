Still eating more and more of intels cake. This marked will always exists even with AI growing more and more, despite of this while AI could be a bubble, which i dont think, traditional data center is relativly save. AMD is almost on par with NVIDIA in terms of AI hardware capabilities. However, it lags behind in software, particularly due to NVIDIA's CUDA, which has created a near-monopoly in the AI development ecosystem. This dominance is disliked by many companies. Overall, AMD has a broader product portfolio, which provides a more secure position in the market. I",1,0.569,0.986,POSITIVE
