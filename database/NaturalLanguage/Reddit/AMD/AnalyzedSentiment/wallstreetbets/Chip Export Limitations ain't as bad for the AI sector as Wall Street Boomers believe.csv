,"Sure, with Export Limitations in place, NVDA, AMD and INTC can't sell as many Chips to certain foreign countries. But tbh so what? With Blackwell being sold out for the next 12 Months this is not really an Issue for NVDA in the short or mid term, as other customers will fill the gaps. For the US and European AI Software Sector the restrictions should be regarded as good news, because with less systems being sold abroad, they won't have to wait that long for their orders. Further it keeps the foreign competition from getting faster AI chips. This poses a massive advantage for US and European AI Software Producers.
