,,I think they are about to bury Intel soon with all the issues they have. Seems like their plan with agreesive pricing on zen 5 and buying out an ai company. I’ll throw money at it if it goes sub 100 though lol.,0,0.558,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,"There is too much money in circulation for AMD to drop sub 100. I get it, there is an argument that chip companies are overvalued but be realistic with your price targets.",0,0.558,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"It went from 150 to 185 in 1 week and then back to 155 in 3 days.Stock prices do not reflect what the company is worth, the current stock market is just straight up gambling that's completely unpredictable.Nothing is stopping it from literally going from 150 to 100 in the next week and then to 200 the day after.",1,0.607,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,"If the entire market drops EVERYTHING drops. That doesn’t mean that these stocks are suddenly at fair value, it can mean ALOT of stocks are undervalued. When the market sold off there are a lot of things that became oversold and became significantly undervalued hence the crazy bull run we’ve had.

,,Unless like all the big companies that are making their own AI Cards and AMD/NVDA drop back to consumer Cards and mid cap AI @_@. I think people forget how much of the big 7 are footing most of the profits.,0,0.556,0.999,NEGATIVE
,,That's true but the market will get bigger too. Midcaps are a big market.,1,0.586,0.77,NEGATIVE
,,"Mid caps are a big market, but not big in purchase power. Even if every mid cap company spent a generous amount on AI cards with unknown returns at their scale, they are still less than 25% of the big boys who have deep pockets and debt dicks to swing around.The midcaps will end up buying AI from them not risk making it themselves.The second any of the big boys get their own chips online NVDA is basically dead, especially when they are still halted on exports to continue growing.AMD has yet to do anything meaningful with AI, they have stuff coming out at EOY, but even then it looks very barebones when you have NVDA new launch.",2,0.553,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,"Which company did you go through to invest pre IPO?Also, I've never done it. How does it work? Do you commit $10k and then whatever the IPO price will be, you get the number of shares depending on that IPO announced share price?",3,0.571,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"I used linqto. First time for me too. They have a price per share , I think it was around 50$ which was an implied valuation of 7.7 billion . So 200 shares for my 10k . I’ve since had a couple of offers from EquityZen at lower prices per share 35$ I think but they were for 65k and 125k investments….So I’d need the ipo price to be significantly higher to have been worthwhile getting in pre ipo and I have my doubts about that….",4,0.531,0.814,POSITIVE
