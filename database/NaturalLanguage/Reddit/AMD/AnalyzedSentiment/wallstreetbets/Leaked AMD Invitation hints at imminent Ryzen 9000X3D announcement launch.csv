,,The new X3D CPU has been expected by hardware news channels for a while now. Many had guessed that the announcement would take place on the 25th. But a now leaked invitation suggests that the announcement will take place on the 23rd.Since this has not yet been officially anounced. I think this launch (early november) is not fully priced in. The release will be good for amd sales in the holiday season especially after the otherwise weak Ryzen 9000 series launch.This could be a much needed impulse for the stock ahead of earings to slow the fall of the price.,0,0.548,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,"Also, I believe that they are also going to announce a limited RDNA3 refresh with some new GRE models, which might be limited to the chinese market.This is most likely done to get rid of RDNA3 stock without having to announce price cuts.",0,0.569,0.998,NEGATIVE
,,I want the news that everything will have 3D V-cache from now on. Seems like people just wait for it anyway.,0,0.506,0.998,NEGATIVE
,,"I don't think every gpu needs 3D v-cache. Think Office computers laptops. However, they should stop trying to marketing non-x3D cpu as gaming cpus.",1,0.509,0.635,POSITIVE
,,"Yea, I was speaking in reference to their flagship CPUs aimed at gaming.",2,0.509,0.999,NEGATIVE
,,"I sold my AMD at 97$ around 2021 I thought - I already doubled my profits, their GPUs aren't close to nvidia, no point in keeping them, which was true because after this they went down.I was really tempted to buy them after Intel shat the bed with their CPUs (this was around the end of July) but I checked how they are going and it was not really convincing for me, so I skipped them. I would be up 4-5% if I bought them, which is not enough for me. I really don't understand how AMD is not going up when you have either Intel or AMD CPUs for most of the computers.",0,0.558,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"Yes, but AMD seems to have a talent for f***ing things up by making weird desicions and not properly coordinating between departements.They have lost consumer GPU market share even though the last gen was pretty ok and fairly priced compared to nvidia. At this point I'm wondering, if it makes even sense for them to keep making consumer gpu, if people don't buy them.",1,0.552,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,There is a popular joke on r/pcgamers - we want AMD to have low priced GPUs so nvidia will lower their and we can buy them.,2,0.562,0.999,NEGATIVE
