I think it was -5% YTD last week despite being the CPU leader (now that Intel is struggling) and the next go to GPU manufacturers.I am bullish on AMD for several reasonsAlternative GPUs at budget when NVDA can't meet supply demand over the coming years.Hands down the best CPUs for both consumers and data centers. And you need CPUs for inferencing with AI models trained on GPUs.PC market entering the 4-5 year upgrade period next year, especially with windows 10 support ending.Potential announcements of next gen consoles for which AMD makes custom processorsThat being said, the fair value of AMD right now is about 150-160 in my opinionMy positions are- 170 C Jan 2026 and 200 C Jan 2026 and 13k worth of shares that I bought over the last 2 weeks.Good luck to you brother!!",0,0.583,0.646,POSITIVE

Might as well holding them through worthless by this Friday.,"Last time I checked Amazon/ Newegg for best selling CPUs, its all AMD in top 10-15 especially with the cyber monday sales. With Intel falling behind recently, Epyc chips already have about 30% market shares gaining like 5 percent shares from Intel, which is just going to broaden even more.I agree AMD has nothing over CUDA, and it's a sector that they are years behind NVDA, maybe even too far to catch up.I don't think AMD is ""dead"" in consumer GPUs. I agree most developers make games with NVDA in mind, but it's definitely a budget alternative to NVDA, especially in not so rich counties.And take what I say next with a grain of salt- I think AMD will be the ones to cover up NVDA leftovers. I am also expecting AMD to come up with their own parallel computing platform given their recent acquisitions. I know this is also a long shot, but AMD might get considered to be able to run with CUDA if the demand skyrockets.The reason I went balls deep in my AMD position, is I thought AMD was trading below its fair price.",2,0.568,0.912,NEGATIVE
