,nan,"Thanks for your submission!To keep things interesting, we want to see big gains and big losses!So we've set the following thresholds for Gain, Loss, and YOLO flaired posts:YOLO posts must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares and recently opened.Gain / Loss posts must show realized gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares.We want to see the actual trade. What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).This is what a great post looks like:$17.2K Gain on AMZN - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!Here are examples of what could get your post removed:$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, the position hasn't been closed yet.Here are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:$75,000 DDOG Loss. - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about why they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.$1.1MM Loss, No details - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to reach out to modmail and we'll give you some pointers!",0,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.999

Don‚Äôt feel rushed or like you need to find a way to massively grow your finances.Off to a great start already - just be patient and keep building steadily. You have so much time on your side. I was where you were when I was in my early 20s and thought I was a genius after a few good trades, went all in on some bad plays and lost like half of what I had earned in short order.

,nan,"If you want to fast forward to retirement I would recommend buying weekly options with around 50% of your balance. Double that and keep initial money. Play with profits. If you lose it, just martingale. You can't keep losing forever.",0,0.514,POSITIVE,0.636

,nan,"Don‚Äôt listen to this guy, that‚Äôs an awful idea. You open yourself up to an incredibly idea.If you want to trade options spend a few months deep diving in them and learn, understand, and read up on them. Absolutely don‚Äôt take 50% and trade options with no knowledge.This is assuming you know nothing about them. Start by paper trading.",2,0.516,NEGATIVE,1.0
