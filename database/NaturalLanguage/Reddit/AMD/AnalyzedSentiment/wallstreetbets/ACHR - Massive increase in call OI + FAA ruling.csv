They're likely to place a bid, which market makers will then hit. Sure, they all trade on the bid, but someone still bought 100k calls. You don't just lift the hard offer. Well maybe you do, but someone buying 100k calls has a brain. The OI went up 100k overnight, they're still 0.15b for 15k today (the price it traded at yesterday). The calls were bought.
