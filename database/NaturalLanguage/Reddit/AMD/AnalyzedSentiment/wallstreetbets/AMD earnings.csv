Their earnings are flat, their revenue is flat, and their valuation is through the roof (like everything else on the market).They have basically ceded the GPU war to NVidia, so long term, their only road to growth will come from continuing to take Intel's share of the pie. I think they will continue to execute on that very well, but there's not a ton of meat on that bone. And the valuation is already really aggressive for a company with flat earnings and limited prospects to increase them.Good company, bad price.
