,All in ......,AWS services a lot of smaller companies and doesn't really have their own big GenAI products with lots of users yet. These smaller companies are more likely to deploy Nvidia as it's a lower barrier to entry.Thus far AMD has had more success with big players who are scaling their inference capabilities for their own customer facing GenAI products.

,All in ......,I can't make money long term with AMD. I tried buying and holding and that was flat after a year when everything else was up massively and the SP500 was up 30% for the same period.

,All in ......,I don't see how that's relevant? He said he couldn't make money long term on AMD. I simply pointed out that its been incredibly easy to make money long term on AMD.AMD is up 50x in 10 years and TSLA is only up 28x. All depends on what time horizon you pick.,3,0.607,NEGATIVE,1.0

,All in ......,Sell it all buy nvda ? Tell me why get amd a losing stock? Pick the winner stop with the sunk cost fallacy and btw pe also says nvda is cheaper . But u will buy a stock that‚Äôs over priced Amazon also says nah we don‚Äôt want u nor do our customers boa just downgraded it . Amd has no monopoly or moat . But u wanna buy it bc well it‚Äôs not nvda and u think you are smarter and want to be different . Not saying it won‚Äôt go up but sometimes when you have a losing horse and in the middle of the race you can change your bet you should . Not financial advice .,0,0.558,NEGATIVE,1.0
