,"TLDR: $VSH (Vishay Intertechnology) is printing money while everyone sleeps on it. $VSH just got the stamp of approval from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, confirming it as a hidden winner in Nvidia’s AI and RTX 50 supply chain. With key wins in MOSFETs, capacitors, and resistors, $VSH is now primed for explosive growth, riding Nvidia’s dominance in AI servers and GPUs. If you’re not jacked up on $VSH, you’re not meant to have money. Who is $VSH? Vishay Intertechnology is a veteran in the electronics industry. They make essential components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and semiconductors. You know, the boring stuff that makes your GPU, PS5, and electric toothbrush actually work. They’ve been doing this since 1962. That’s right, this company has survived every market downturn, bubble, and chip shortage in the last 60+ years. Meanwhile, you can’t even survive a red day on SPY. Why $VSH is printing money: Chips are everywhere—cars, phones, smart homes, AI servers. The global semiconductor market is growing at an insane pace (projected $1 trillion market by 2030). Guess what? Vishay is supplying the guts. Look at their P/E ratio: 12.5 (as of last check). Compare that to Nvidia’s 75+ or AMD’s 30-ish. $VSH is practically trading at the bargain bin, and yet their revenues are consistently strong. Vishay’s last earnings report crushed expectations, with double-digit growth in several segments. They’re sitting on $3.4B in annual revenue with plans to scale. Oh, and they’re buying back shares like they’re on clearance at Costco. Everyone’s hyped about Nvidia because of AI. Guess what? Vishay supplies components used in AI hardware, EV charging stations, and industrial automation. While Nvidia makes the sexy GPUs, Vishay sells the boring but essential resistors and capacitors that keep those GPUs from melting your motherboard. They’re eating up the market share. Recent Catalysts: Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo dropped a bombshell: Vishay is a key supplier for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI servers (GB200 series, DGX/HGX B200) and the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. These are Nvidia’s future bread-and-butter products, dominating AI and high-end gaming. Vishay replaced Infineon as Nvidia’s MOSFET supplier. Yes, Infineon, the semiconductor giant, just got sidelined. This Is MASSIVE for $VSH. Vishay is providing MOSFET/DrMOS (VRPower), vPolyTan (Polymer Tantalum Capacitors), and Current Shunt Resistors. These components are critical for Nvidia’s most cutting-edge products: • GB200 series AI servers: Nvidia’s next-gen AI infrastructure. • RTX 50 series GPUs: The next flagship graphics cards. Vishay’s vPolyTan capacitors (especially the T55 series) are already facing a supply crunch for 2025. That’s how in-demand they are. Kuo estimates that Vishay’s MOSFET production alone will contribute 20%-30% of revenue by 2025—with above-average gross profit margins. The vPolyTan capacitors will add a high single-digit percentage of revenue with significantly above-average margins. Translation? Vishay is printing money. Vishay’s production lines are already at capacity through 2025. When your biggest challenge is meeting demand, you’re in a good spot. Beyond Nvidia, Vishay is also poised to benefit from: • Automotive rebound: As EV production scales, Vishay’s components are critical. • IoT growth: Billions of devices mean billions of tiny components. Vishay is at the center of it. The Stock Is Still Cheap Even after today’s 7% jump to $18.35, $VSH is wildly undervalued. As I said earlier, the P/E ratio is still around 12-13, compared to Nvidia’s 75+. This is a company with real earnings, real dividends, and real growth potential. This is a great opportunity to make back everything you lost from your MSTR calls. Positions: Shares, 01/17/25 20C",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE

Compare that to Nvidia’s 75+ or AMD’s 30-ish. $VSH is practically trading at the bargain bin, and yet their revenues are consistently strong. Vishay’s last earnings report crushed expectations, with double-digit growth in several segments. They’re sitting on $3.4B in annual revenue with plans to scale. Oh, and they’re buying back shares like they’re on clearance at Costco. Everyone’s hyped about Nvidia because of AI. Guess what? Vishay supplies components used in AI hardware, EV charging stations, and industrial automation. While Nvidia makes the sexy GPUs, Vishay sells the boring but essential resistors and capacitors that keep those GPUs from melting your motherboard. They’re eating up the market share. Recent Catalysts: Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo dropped a bombshell: Vishay is a key supplier for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI servers (GB200 series, DGX/HGX B200) and the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. These are Nvidia’s future bread-and-butter products, dominating AI and high-end gaming. Vishay replaced Infineon as Nvidia’s MOSFET supplier. Yes, Infineon, the semiconductor giant, just got sidelined. This Is MASSIVE for $VSH. Vishay is providing MOSFET/DrMOS (VRPower), vPolyTan (Polymer Tantalum Capacitors), and Current Shunt Resistors. These components are critical for Nvidia’s most cutting-edge products: • GB200 series AI servers: Nvidia’s next-gen AI infrastructure. • RTX 50 series GPUs: The next flagship graphics cards. Vishay’s vPolyTan capacitors (especially the T55 series) are already facing a supply crunch for 2025. That’s how in-demand they are. Kuo estimates that Vishay’s MOSFET production alone will contribute 20%-30% of revenue by 2025—with above-average gross profit margins. The vPolyTan capacitors will add a high single-digit percentage of revenue with significantly above-average margins. Translation? Vishay is printing money. Vishay’s production lines are already at capacity through 2025. When your biggest challenge is meeting demand, you’re in a good spot. Beyond Nvidia, Vishay is also poised to benefit from: • Automotive rebound: As EV production scales, Vishay’s components are critical. • IoT growth: Billions of devices mean billions of tiny components. Vishay is at the center of it. The Stock Is Still Cheap Even after today’s 7% jump to $18.35, $VSH is wildly undervalued.

,"TLDR: $VSH (Vishay Intertechnology) is printing money while everyone sleeps on it. $VSH just got the stamp of approval from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, confirming it as a hidden winner in Nvidia’s AI and RTX 50 supply chain. With key wins in MOSFETs, capacitors, and resistors, $VSH is now primed for explosive growth, riding Nvidia’s dominance in AI servers and GPUs. If you’re not jacked up on $VSH, you’re not meant to have money. Who is $VSH? Vishay Intertechnology is a veteran in the electronics industry. They make essential components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and semiconductors. You know, the boring stuff that makes your GPU, PS5, and electric toothbrush actually work. They’ve been doing this since 1962. That’s right, this company has survived every market downturn, bubble, and chip shortage in the last 60+ years. Meanwhile, you can’t even survive a red day on SPY. Why $VSH is printing money: Chips are everywhere—cars, phones, smart homes, AI servers. The global semiconductor market is growing at an insane pace (projected $1 trillion market by 2030). Guess what? Vishay is supplying the guts. Look at their P/E ratio: 12.5 (as of last check). Compare that to Nvidia’s 75+ or AMD’s 30-ish. $VSH is practically trading at the bargain bin, and yet their revenues are consistently strong. Vishay’s last earnings report crushed expectations, with double-digit growth in several segments. They’re sitting on $3.4B in annual revenue with plans to scale. Oh, and they’re buying back shares like they’re on clearance at Costco. Everyone’s hyped about Nvidia because of AI. Guess what? Vishay supplies components used in AI hardware, EV charging stations, and industrial automation. While Nvidia makes the sexy GPUs, Vishay sells the boring but essential resistors and capacitors that keep those GPUs from melting your motherboard. They’re eating up the market share. Recent Catalysts: Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo dropped a bombshell: Vishay is a key supplier for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI servers (GB200 series, DGX/HGX B200) and the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. These are Nvidia’s future bread-and-butter products, dominating AI and high-end gaming. Vishay replaced Infineon as Nvidia’s MOSFET supplier. Yes, Infineon, the semiconductor giant, just got sidelined. This Is MASSIVE for $VSH. Vishay is providing MOSFET/DrMOS (VRPower), vPolyTan (Polymer Tantalum Capacitors), and Current Shunt Resistors. These components are critical for Nvidia’s most cutting-edge products: • GB200 series AI servers: Nvidia’s next-gen AI infrastructure. • RTX 50 series GPUs: The next flagship graphics cards. Vishay’s vPolyTan capacitors (especially the T55 series) are already facing a supply crunch for 2025. That’s how in-demand they are. Kuo estimates that Vishay’s MOSFET production alone will contribute 20%-30% of revenue by 2025—with above-average gross profit margins. The vPolyTan capacitors will add a high single-digit percentage of revenue with significantly above-average margins. Translation? Vishay is printing money. Vishay’s production lines are already at capacity through 2025. When your biggest challenge is meeting demand, you’re in a good spot.
