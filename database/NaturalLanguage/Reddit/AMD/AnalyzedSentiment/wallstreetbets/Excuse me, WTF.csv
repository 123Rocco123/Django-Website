,nan,She saw there was no future in the direction they were going and that there is gold in them there AI hills. She has done a massive amount of work in transitioning AMD to be a possible future direct competitor and with that is about as much potential as you can think of.,2,0.548,POSITIVE,0.608

,nan,"Why not? She pulled AMD out of $2 a share and its trading at $130. She took back significant market share from Intel in both server and pc markets. While the GPU's aren't as powerful as Nvidia they are a good value buy. She is running a well founded company now.Now as for the stock price. Remember AMD has issues with being dependent on political climates. Remember they manufacture in Taiwan and with the threat of China along with tariffs people are hesitant to stay in. Stock is not 100% sales and revenue.What should we look for, for future pricing?Relations with China and Taiwan and other regional political instabilityTariffs and their long term effects2a. included in this is shifting production from Taiwan to Arizona's TSMC plantBTC and other coin values and people setting up mining rigs again.Market saturation (server) People may not be upgrading servers anytime soon, looing back to tariffs, market sales may slow down due to increase pricing.Sales due to gaming market - Look this year kind of sucked for AAA titles we were about 50/50 so a person's desire to upgrade systems to play new games was a miss (Personal Opinion)A bunch of us sold at around 200 cause you know, if you dont sell you dont make money.",0,0.575,NEGATIVE,1.0
