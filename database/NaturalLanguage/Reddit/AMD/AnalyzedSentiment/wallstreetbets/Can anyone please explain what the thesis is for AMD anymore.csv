Can someone with more knowledge provide some reasons for why AMD even deserves it's current 123 P/E?",I hope you're not using trailing PE to value AMD. If you dig into their financials you'll see a lot of it is just accounting they are writing down the 50B Xilinx acquisition from 2022 so it makes their profitability look weaker than it really is. I think they are writing down 600-700M per quarter right now and will do so for another 10 years or so. And their growth should accelerate looking forward as data center offsets the weak sales in gaming (-68%) and embedded they had this year. Data center revenue is up 122% YoY and is now 50% of their total revenues. It was only 25% in 2023. Soon this high margin segment will drown out the lower margin segments and their profitability will increase rapidly.,2,0.556,NEGATIVE,1.0

They address CPU, GPU, networking, FPGA, etc. They offer a compelling alternative to Nvidia for scaling up AI inferencing on their GPUs. For example, Meta is buying a ton of AMD GPUs for inferencing. Nvidia is still the king in training for now but it's very likely that the emphasis in AI data center build out will transition to inferencing as we hit a wall on training and inference workloads continue to increase rapidly. GPT-o1 is also a new paradigm that scales on inference instead of training. Nvidia won't be able to make enough chips fast enough to address inferencing demand.

All of this stuff is not possible without ASML and the yield control is not possible without KLAC. Both of those have already corrected substantially and are trading much cheaperI'm also growing more and more convinced you don't want to have a high-tech exposure for 2025.

As with this example, intel eventually lost market share and was left in the dust by its competitors. People that bet on NVDA when INTC was dominating earned a large premium for their bet.Investing in NVDA competitors is taking a bet that some time within your investing time horizon, NVDA will lose market share to other companies, like AMD, and your returns over the course of that time will be greater.

Can someone with more knowledge provide some reasons for why AMD even deserves it's current 123 P/E?","AMD is only really in the AI GPU market since not even a year. They're going all in on the world's hottest market. They have significant IP in their understanding of chiplets, which allows them to circumvent the sort of overheating and yield issues that Blackwell had had, or is still having. If you want a single AI chip for inferencing, then AMD is already highly competitive.But to really be competitive, they need an alternative to both CUDA and advanced backend networking that makes Nvidia chips work in clusters. In both fields they are moving full steam ahead. The question is when the big breakthrough will be, if ever. I say MI350 is looking highly promising, and I'm curious about their own Pensando solutions re networking, and/or a solution by Broadcom that might also be compatible.If they have a total package that'd be competitive with Nvidia, then the orders will simply be coming in. The demand is too high not to.Also the PE is not really over 100. They used an accounting trick to spread out billions in goodwill amortization from the Xilinx acquisition over years, lowering their tax exposure by on paper lowering their income. Look at forward PE and non-GAAP instead.",0,0.555,NEGATIVE,0.911
