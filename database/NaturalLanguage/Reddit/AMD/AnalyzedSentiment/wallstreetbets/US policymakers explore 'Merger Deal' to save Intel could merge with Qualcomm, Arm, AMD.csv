,So we buy calls now?,"Yup. We just need to get the nepotism out of SMCI and the problem is it's ingrained.Having supplied and advanced the server market for 30 years, it is likely that Super Micro is suffering from a case of nepotism as its core issue. Nearly all of its top leadership is in some way interconnected on a personal level.While Liang and his wife Sara Liu are co-founders, Yih-Shyan (Wally) Liaw was forced to resign in January 2018 due to aforementioned regulatory and audit pressures. Wally returned in May 2021, having a stake in a 2CRSi Corporation that conducts business with Super Micro in the high-performance computing (HPC) market.Close family members all work for Super Micro in some capacity and across the company‚Äôs subsidiaries, from Hung-Fan (Sara Liu‚Äôs brother) and Shao Fen Kao (Sara Liu‚Äôs sister-in-law) to Mien-Hsia (another Sara Liu‚Äôs sister-in-law). The brother of Charles Liang, Steve Liang, presides over Ablecom as CEO, which is Super Micro‚Äôs subsidiary. Likewise, another younger brother of Charles Liang, Bill Liang, is heading Compuware together with his brother Steve. Both he and his wife are Ablecom shareholders. Compuware itself is 15% owned by Ablecom, per Hindenburg data. Even the sibling of aforementioned Wally has a stake in Ablecom.From this interconnectedness, it appears that purported misaccounting comes from sales to Ablecom and Compuware, who then might be selling gear back to Super Micro in a familial self-contained economy.https://tokenist.com/smci-impending-doom-or-a-massive-buy-the-dip-opportunity/What a shit show.",2,0.521,NEGATIVE,0.999

Why should they? Rumor has it nvidia is going to create a competitor to the M[1-4] processors. If they‚Äôre able to match Apple‚Äôs performance while simultaneously creating an ecosystem to rival x86, Intel could be in even more trouble.Realistically what Intel needs to do here is what AMD did two decades ago. Spin off its FAB unit and sell. The issues Intel are having are mostly created by the fact that their in house fabrication process has fallen behind in the era of EUV lithography.

The answer is INTEL.EUV wasn't needed until... Hmm. SAQP did/does what EUV does, for cheaper. In fact, TSMC still uses SAQP for gate and diffusion with EUV at the first few metal layers. One could argue that the design rules are similar enough for gate/diffusion and M0-M3 that EUV isn't really needed. The newer nodes on the horizon will, but Intel's pitch met or exceeded TSMC at comparable ""nodes"" which is just a meaningless marketing number.",2,0.512,NEGATIVE,1.0
