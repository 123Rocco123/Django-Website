The lower the interest rate the more money overall they will be able to lend out and the more interest and loan origination fees they can collect.It‚Äôs better for them to collect 3% off a trillion dollars than 10% off a hundred billion dollars",1,0.512,0.999,NEGATIVE

This market is screwy AF.",1,0.546,0.995,NEGATIVE
,Found on LinkedIn,"Some of that money comes in the form of monthly inflows from all the 401-Ks out there. Even when the shit hits the proverbial fan like in 2020, people still leave their 401-K alone. So every couple of weeks all these passive investors are auto-buying low-fee index funds from their paychecks no matter if the market is up or down. That's why the two biggest shareholders of Apple are Invesco (QQQ) and Vanguard. That ultimately puts a positive pressure on price, with more weight to the largest companies due to the composition of the ETFs.",2,0.52,1.0,NEGATIVE

,Found on LinkedIn,"I always like to look at the world through a log-scale.Here are stocks and money supply.So what I take from that is, that if you want your savings to not decrease as a percentage of the supply, buy some stocks.",4,0.559,0.967,POSITIVE
,Found on LinkedIn,It's because after 2 years of shorting I finally went long on Tuesday. Sorry guys.,0,0.529,0.975,NEGATIVE
,Found on LinkedIn,I don't look at the news. What does good old JP have to do with it?,0,0.539,0.992,NEGATIVE
,Found on LinkedIn,"Said last week that economy doing well. No rate cuts yet. Unemployment numbers came in higher than what the street liked.
