,"One thing I have noticed is the divergence between SOFTWARE and CHIPS, we've seen a MASSIVE inflow into software while the chipmakers lagged. There's 2 sides here to consider: The swing is overdone and that $ will come back to the chips, making plays like NVDA, AMD etc. a possible entry here. Trumps tariffs and trade war with China. Trump is the reason we see this as the software isn't impacted in the same way hardware is, hence production of it won't be impacted given you don't MAKE a physical product. Also, by valuation, the software makers are considerably underinflated in price when compared to their chip maker equivalents. I like the software play here for longer term holds - IGV and HACK are things I'm eyeing. Another thing to consider is NVDA launches new products in January, but then again Trumps Tariffs start in January also.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

Trump’s tariffs definitely hit the chipmakers harder, which is why software’s been in favor—less production risk involved. That said, the chips are undervalued right now, especially names like NVDA and AMD. If those tariffs don’t cause too much damage, the chips could bounce back. But, I’m with you on the software plays for long-term holds—IGV and HACK look solid. Still, I’d keep a close eye on how the market reacts to those upcoming product launches and tariffs in January.",0,0.541,NEGATIVE,0.935
