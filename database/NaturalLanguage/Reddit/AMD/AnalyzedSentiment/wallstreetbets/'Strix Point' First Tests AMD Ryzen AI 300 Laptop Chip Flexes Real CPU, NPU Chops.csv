,,1 good review on 1 laptop is meaningless. I have an AMD CPU in my shitty laptop i use for tuning my car and it sucks balls. Is it representative of the company and the rest of the product line up? Hell no. (it is shit however!),2,0.58,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,Why do you say this?,4,0.475,0.761,NEGATIVE
,,"Because its a Laptop? People use laptops for general productivity and the real users of AI, game designers or 3D artists do not render or process real workloads on their laptops? I think the general public are miles away from understanding real world use cases but absolutely no one on earth would do any sizeable rendering/AI workload job on a portable device. It just isnt practical. Theres a reason why game designers use 4090's and massive Imacs or do work in the cloud. Local processing on a laptop is just never realistic. Therefore charts are fun but meaningless.",5,0.522,1.0,NEGATIVE
