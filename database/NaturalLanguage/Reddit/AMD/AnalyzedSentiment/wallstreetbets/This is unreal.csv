FML ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è","The good news is that you still have money left ü§ë If you trade with smaller size you won‚Äôt be a pussy ass bitch ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been there .. You just gotta get back in ‚Ä¶ remember, the market will always have buyers. When NDX drops ~6% in 2-3 days ‚Ä¶. Buyers or Algos will come in, also .. don‚Äôt pay for the weekend. Wait to buy on Monday morning. I promise you won‚Äôt miss anything and you‚Äôll have a stress free weekend. Last, don‚Äôt trade what you think or ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù ‚Ä¶. When in doubt look at a longer time frame so you can see where those buyers (or sellers) might come back in. Remember, the market always goes up (over time) ‚Ä¶ for traders .. when it drops it‚Äôs usually fast so you can‚Äôt hang on to PUTs. Last, TRADE WHAT‚Äôs WORKING! ‚Ä¶ last week was anything BTC ‚Ä¶ super easy trades for 300%-500%+While I‚Äôm on a roll ‚Ä¶ or my brain is ‚Ä¶ AMZN in general is a HARD trade. It doesn‚Äôt move that much and Bezos has been selling stock like a drug dealer on a corner. AMD is having some trouble keeping up with the big boys, at the moment it‚Äôs a tricky trade. Yes, it‚Äôs in the shitter but it also has some buyers at this level .. I made a bit on AMD calls quickly today but not much. It needs some news to get it going again. NVDA ‚Ä¶ is taking a much needed nap üò¥ after it‚Äôs 155% YTD gain. People love it so you can still trade it but right now it‚Äôs not easy money.Hope that helps!",0,0.529,1.0,NEGATIVE
