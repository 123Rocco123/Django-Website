Same thing happened with the bitchers and moaners with Amazon, Google, etc. When a company is a quality company and especially part of the SP500, where every iteration of that index HAS TO PURCHASE this stock, you ride well, and the company easily slides well into it's PE very well and snuggly like.

THAT BEING SAID, MARKET IS NO LONGER LOOKING FOR INSANE NUCLEAR GROWTH. BUT STEADY HEALTHY GROWTH. THAT** WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. Crazy AI nuclear growth, is not what the market is expecting. Market is expecting a healthy stable growth, now that we are near equilibrium with AI and chips, ( this is obviously not true, but it's the arguments bears try to hang on. They think Amazon will overtake a 30 year CUDA industry software environment the entire world/industry has created THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AROUND). Go look up CUDA. It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four... NVDA continues to climb on growth, steady healthy growth, not insane nuclear growth. THAT WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. It has no where else to go. Ive's and Wedbush, are ENTIRELY correct. Dan Ives and Josh Brown Discuss NVDA https://youtu.be/u-95RKiEl5o?si=8Cpbr3LFWE9WsVju Lastly NVDA will own the entire vertical from Hyperscaler to Retail Individual end user level, why? NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming Latest Sept 2025, with my guess, Jensen starts marketing from first half of 2025, and wider release commercially of NVDA CPU for 1st qtr of 2026, March, me thinks Jensen starts getting market ready all of 2025 for release in the wild September 2025 for retail user and full wider release by March 2026 / end of February 2026. Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?.. I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about. And as far as I know, Biden or Trump won't block sales of regular computer pc windows chips to China or anywhere else for that matter. :) Imagine being the king of accelerated compute and now you have a cpu + gpu combo ARM chip that runs silent like Apple M chips and sips low power like such, but games and does AI and any heavy compute intense task very wicked like, very retail level computer chip level like that is specifically from the box ready to work with cuda and marry with existing nvidia gpu's at the hyperscaler level to even more efficiently run AI intense software and on prem (on the laptop or pc itself without cloud compute help, like QCOM snapdragon Elite PC boasts it can do(but sucks, incompatible with lots of software and games, not so with nvda).

Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025.

I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others.

And as far as I know, Biden or Trump won't block sales of regular computer pc windows chips to China or anywhere else for that matter. :) Imagine being the king of accelerated compute and now you have a cpu + gpu combo ARM chip that runs silent like Apple M chips and sips low power like such, but games and does AI and any heavy compute intense task very wicked like, very retail level computer chip level like that is specifically from the box ready to work with cuda and marry with existing nvidia gpu's at the hyperscaler level to even more efficiently run AI intense software and on prem (on the laptop or pc itself without cloud compute help, like QCOM snapdragon Elite PC boasts it can do(but sucks, incompatible with lots of software and games, not so with nvda).
