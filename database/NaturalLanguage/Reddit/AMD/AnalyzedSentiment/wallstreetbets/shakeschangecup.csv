,"15.7k to 3k in a week. Notable losses included long calls on: MSTR, TSLA, NVDA, AMZN, MSFT, FSLR, AMD, LLY (DM for cashapp)","I used to be like you and many others on this sub, first time experiencing options back in Feb. 2024 with buying NVDA & SPY calls before NVDA earnings. Then it all went downhill from there. After my last big loss I decided to go back to putting most of my money in index ETFs, and learned about wheeling (selling cash secured puts, then covered calls once/if I get assigned). I know it's not as fun but it's been working so far for me. When I want to actually have fun investing gambling I just drive to the casino for live blackjack & poker.",0,0.519,POSITIVE,0.635
