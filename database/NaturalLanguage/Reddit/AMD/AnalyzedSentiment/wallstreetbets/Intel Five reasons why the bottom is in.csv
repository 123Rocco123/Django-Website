Also, commodity CPUs are not a big deal anymore, money is in GPUs for AI. The bottom won’t be in until the company can grow revenue or massively cut costs to stabilize. That means either ramps fabs for external customers, be acquired with mass layoffs, or finally get there act together with AI chips. I’m betting they get bought out.",0,0.561,1.0,NEGATIVE
