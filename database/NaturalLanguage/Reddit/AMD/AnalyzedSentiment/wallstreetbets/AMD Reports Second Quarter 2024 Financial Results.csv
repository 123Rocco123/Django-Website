,,"But growth valuations are forward looking. Nvidia is a multi-trillion dollar company largely based on the assumption that the well isn't going to dry up anytime soon. Problem is, LLMs aren't progressing as rapidly as companies expected relative to the investment cost. Nvidia and related companies are set for the next few years, no doubt. They've already been paid the cost. The problem is valuations can't be justified just based on a few years of everyone wanting the best chips. What happens if META/Microsoft/Google etc start saying ""ya know what, we'll stand pat with the billions we've already spent on cards."" The answer is the bubble pops. From there, it'll probably recover to a more justified valuation. Make no mistake, AI is legit. But the current gold rush might not be.",6,0.543,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,"While i agree that semis and ai infrastructure sellers is the way to go/invest now i don't even think it's a concern for msft/amzn/goog/meta, they all must have a thousand ideas on how to monetize. How much time it took google and facebook/meta to be actually profitable after years of huge capex? when what you do is important/relevant you will eventually end up making money it's really that simple. Of course that you can go deeper with a million numbers and expectations to see if stock is overvalued at certain point in time and it's better to sell and wait a better entry point, but these companies path is up.",4,0.537,0.996,NEGATIVE

,,Sure it is. If LLMs and other modes don‚Äôt convert into the money buying those chips they won‚Äôt go for round 2 to train the next model. If models have peaked (they have) then you don‚Äôt need much more chips,4,0.512,0.999,POSITIVE
