,,"I have the oposite position PLTR as i think there is more room for a drop than a up. At 250 EP they will have to show PERFECT result and even so the stock is priced in, but anything is possible, lots of ppl think it will drop big so... expect the unexpectedwell im balls deep with goog no secret, they are underpriced and if they show nice results they wil surely pump nicelyAmd, i dont like, they havent yet showed interesting results despite all the hype over AI and chips, overpriced for meGL",2,0.517,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,Nov 1st for AMD and GOOG Nov 8th for PLTR,1,0.58,0.923,NEGATIVE
,,"UPDATE: Sold my AMD position. Iâ€™m happy with nearly 80% profit. If it pumps, well my instinct was correct. If it dumps, at least I got out with profit. Most of you are right. Thereâ€™s a lot of uncertainty. AMD simply does not have enough data to show concrete demand (as of now). I simply took advantage of the new AI trend. That being said, the earnings report has to be perfect. I mean beating expectations by a big margin. This is where I donâ€™t have the full confidence in despite the upside potential for the companyâ€™s long term portfolio, Iâ€™m only here for the short term. Good luck everyone else!",0,0.569,1.0,NEGATIVE
