,"from last quarters cc Patrick Gelsinger ""Yeah. And Gaudi 3 announcement this quarter extremely well-received. And as I mentioned already, 20-plus customers for Gaudi 2, 3, so we're seeing that build. Obviously, Falcon Shores will build on that momentum. We'll be bringing that late next year when Falcon Shores, when we combine the great systolic performance of Gaudi 3 with a fully programmable architecture and all of that comes together with Falcon Shores. And then we have a rich, a very aggressive cadence of Falcon Shores products following that. We also added the Gaudi 3 PC IE card to it, this use case of Xeon plus an accelerator or Gaudi accelerator is getting very good response from customers as well.
