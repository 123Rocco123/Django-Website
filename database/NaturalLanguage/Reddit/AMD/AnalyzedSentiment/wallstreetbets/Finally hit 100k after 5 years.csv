The main figure you want to determine: How much you can put towards investing and savings each paycheck or month.Get an account with an online broker such as Schwab, ETrade, Robinhood, VanguardIf this is Money that you absolutely will not need to touch for decades, you'll want this account to be a Roth IRA. This is a retirement account that the basic idea is: You are putting in money that is already taxed, it will grow tax free, and you can withdraw tax and penalty free if you're past retirement age. There is a cap for what you are allowed to contribute each year. Besides that, it works similar to a traditional broker account where you can invest in stocks/ETFS/Funds/etc.Now the big question, what the heck do you buy?The ""safe"" (nothing is 100% safe), route is to put most of your money into ETFs such as VOO or similar.""Geeky, that's too many words""If anything is confusing there, then I highly recommend searching for a local Financial or Investment Planner.
