,,"One of the main issues with a wafer size chip is yield issues become extremely noticable. Sure, a singular chip might be very fast for specific tasks, but if you have to throw most away it becomes wildly expensive and hard to scale. ",0,0.513,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,It has 900k individual cores. They simply turn off the cores that have flaws.,1,0.506,0.998,NEGATIVE
,,This is exactly it. They will not be able to mass produce this chip due to crazy low yields. Still impressive but different ballpark than Nvidia.,1,0.525,0.522,NEGATIVE
,,Itâ€™s not a single processor - they turn off the individual cores that fail during test. They still get the advantage of the faster interconnects by being wafer scale even if the process means they have to turn off 1-5% of the individual cores.This is no different to how Intel and AMD increase their yields by binning their processors (those with failing cores get binned into a lower count SKU).,2,0.533,0.996,NEGATIVE
,,"I think you're missing the point, it's not about turning off 1-5% of the cores, it's about the yield issues becoming extremely noticeable as the chip size increases. Even with binning, Intel and AMD still have to deal with yields and defect rates, this wafer-scale approach just amplifies those problems.",3,0.534,0.865,POSITIVE
,,And it can core an appleâ€¦the chchchip of the future,0,0.521,0.994,POSITIVE
,,And they will IPO very soon,0,0.52,0.945,POSITIVE
