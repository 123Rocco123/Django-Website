,"The only reason I can think of to not short AMD is that NVIDIA will continue to have good news cycles and AMD will come along for the ride, bringing AMD's P/E up to 300 for no rational reason. Am I regarded?","Much of its P/E is due to a recent acquisition that was seen as being strategic important by the market. Its forward P/e ratio is still somewhat high, but not out of the line compared to other semiconductor stocks.",0,0.55,0.59,POSITIVE
,"The only reason I can think of to not short AMD is that NVIDIA will continue to have good news cycles and AMD will come along for the ride, bringing AMD's P/E up to 300 for no rational reason.

,"The only reason I can think of to not short AMD is that NVIDIA will continue to have good news cycles and AMD will come along for the ride, bringing AMD's P/E up to 300 for no rational reason. Am I regarded?","They're having an AI event on Oct 10th. Last time they held one December 2023, their stocks jumped 19% in the first month, up to 80% by the third month.Almost a month ago they confirmed a long running rumour that they would stop competing against NVIDIA in the high end consumer market. A top tier NVIDIA GPU alone costs more than an entire mid tier PC. AMD has rarely had the edge and never been able to maintain it for very long, so they're focusing on mid to lower gear, which really, is most consumer's price point. But besides that, they've merged those now defunct departments with the sole purpose of having them focus on AI.Jack Huynh in an interview with Tom's Hardware on September 9th, ""...I don't want AMD to be the company that only people who can afford Porches and Ferraris can buy. We want to build gaming systems for millions of users."" That's when their stock started its recent climb.",0,0.557,1.0,NEGATIVE

,"The only reason I can think of to not short AMD is that NVIDIA will continue to have good news cycles and AMD will come along for the ride, bringing AMD's P/E up to 300 for no rational reason. Am I regarded?",Amd has taken a lot of Intel’s marketshare in a lot of different waysIn Datacenter/AI CPU space Amd currently blows Intel out of the water. Intel has taken the lead for like two weeks and AMD is coming out with Turin in a week. Turin will blow Intels offering off the board.Yes Nvidia is the leader by a long shot but your second place offering is going to be AMD. Keep in mind Nvidia does more of the GPU stuff.Amd has continued to grow especially in high margin Datacenter and their margins are very healthy.Amd leads in individual desktop chip cpu sales too. After the 13th and 14th gen debacle Intel had a lot more people are going with AMD. Amd also has essentially has the best offerings as well.Amd only owns 25%ish of the Laptop market. They have room to grow quite a lot here if they get aggressive with it. **Easier said than done.The final thing that people aren’t paying attention to is that these Datacenter/Server/AI contracts typically run for a couple years and when you gain a massive customer base unless you really fuck up they aren’t very likely to change.,0,0.576,0.801,POSITIVE
,"The only reason I can think of to not short AMD is that NVIDIA will continue to have good news cycles and AMD will come along for the ride, bringing AMD's P/E up to 300 for no rational reason. Am I regarded?","It's like people think AI is all they're about. Between AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA, there's not a PC or laptop in any home or office that doesn't have their hardware, as it's been for decades. Of the 3 big players, NVIDIA is the youngest, 1993. AMD 1969, and Intel 1971.",1,0.589,0.935,POSITIVE
,"The only reason I can think of to not short AMD is that NVIDIA will continue to have good news cycles and AMD will come along for the ride, bringing AMD's P/E up to 300 for no rational reason. Am I regarded?","Because the market is still young (in terms of ML datacenters) and AMD is well positioned to take lots of market share.People on this subreddit have no clue how ML even works, or what kind of workloads are required and why the hardware market is acting the way it's acting. They just read that Nvidia has the best hardware and CUDA is dominant (which is rather true), but they have 0 clue about the economics. E.g. 8x MI300 beat 8xH100 at inference, at a quarter the price. Llama, which is a great OS model from meta does very very well on AMD stack.This market is still extremely new, and people believing that Nvidia has a monopoly are as clueless as people that sent Cisco to be the most valuable company on the planet 24 years ago because it had the best routers and internet was the next big thing. Internet was the next big thing but you know what wasn't? The growth, the margin expectations and the idea Cisco had a monopoly.Seriously that whole thing evolves at an insane pace, and it will keep evolving at a huge pace for the foreseeable future, anybody that believes that a single company has a stronghold over everything just hasn't learned anything about software and hardware and the economics of it at scale.Btw I don't hold AMD stock and I would not buy it.",0,0.561,0.992,NEGATIVE

Sometimes it makes sense to buy a stock more because you like how their future is looking, rather than just how much the numbers went up on the last financial period compared to the one prior to that.I think in tech, a lot of investors are speculating about future value from AI breakthroughs.
