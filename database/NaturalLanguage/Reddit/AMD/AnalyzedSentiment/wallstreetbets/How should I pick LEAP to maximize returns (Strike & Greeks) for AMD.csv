,"Hypothetically, if I think a stock like AMD could go up in the next year and I intend on buying an 18 months out LEAP with the intention on re-selling it after the stock price goes up without suffering too much from theta decay. What strike price will it give me the highest % return? Should I go for ITM, ATM or OTM. I understand OTM is the cheapest option to go for and perhaps will give me the highest return if it later becomes ITM. Take AMD June 2026 for example, I see the theta decay being higher for some of the OTM options compared to ATM. I also noticed a higher delta and gamma for ATM options vs OTM. As for IV, the option chain demonstrates a volatility smile. Does this mean the ATM option is the cheapest option while demonstrating a higher % change for stock upsides or downsides? From a pure return perspective, does ITM options do well? I know ITM options are great for risk management or yield strategies such as a synthetic covered call. But I’m just curious which option provides the highest absolute returns if the stock price goes up. Any advice is greatly appreciated!",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

So if you want to minimize theta decay you go deep ITM at around 0.8 - 0.9 delta. As a random example this would be something https://optionstrat.com/build/long-call/AMD/.AMD260116C85But this is if you want to have high probability of profiting. Its not really for WSB.,0,0.53,NEGATIVE,1.0

I’m seeing AMD June 2026 130 calls for about 3k/contract.I also like playing with shorter LEAPS or let’s say not so short expiration dates. I think the longest we’re 6-9 months out.
