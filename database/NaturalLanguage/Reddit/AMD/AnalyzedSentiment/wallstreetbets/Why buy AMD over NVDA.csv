So, just wondering if someone could explain the point of buying AMD over NVDA as I have 2 related parents. thanks :)","NVIDIA's software, such as cuda, is integrated almost to a point of no return. Literally every model used by any company smaller than a local startup is relying on cuda functionalities. Companies already don't like to switch frameworks unless there's a VERY good reason - in fact, companies will usually continue working with years old version of software unless they are forced to upgrade to a newer version (of the same software, let alone a different one all together).But sure, let's assume AMD magically improved zluda to be better than cuda in some way, AND companies decided it's worth switching to it permanently. Even then, AMD simply doesn't have the funds to outbuy chip manufacturing space (Nvidia owns a significant share of 3/4 nm space). The only way AMD can beat out nvidia hardware wise is if 1) a group of companies come together and dump money on AMD to outbid nvidia on space or 2) AMD gets funding to create their own manufacturing plants.With that being said, I never said anything about nvidia's stock continuously going up forever. Stock is something different and not 1-to-1 correlated to the likelihood that amd is unlikely to ever beat nvidia. Obviously, the stock would peak at some point once it is confirmed that ""infinite"" growth is priced in. However, I fail to see how that makes AMD a buy over some other company.",4,0.59,1.0,NEGATIVE

Just because AMD touches their toes in AI a little, and they make GPUs, does not mean they take it as seriously as NVDA has been. To put it into perspective, the whole reason the modern AI boom even happened is because a researcher decided to use write custom CUDA kernels for their deep learning model. But even before that, NVDA has had close ties to the supercomputing and research space. This isn't something where AMD can catch up overnight. As more AI players start popping up, the entrenched ones will soon realize that leasing their existing NVDA stack is a great way to make a quick buck, thus increasing the dependency on NVDA.

Customers increasingly want competition in the market & AMD will offer alternatives on-par in performance & likely cheaper. AMD will never become the market leader probably, but NVDA currently owns 92% of the market from what I have read. AMD has 3%. AMD has much more to gain & NVDA much more to lose. probably more upside to AMD than NVDA at this point at time as well, considering the run NVDA has been on.

You'll get exposure to both (with the rest of the sector) and you'll catch up on the AMD gains over NVDA decline, if that happens.I invested in 2021 in SMH, which has given me great returns, not as great as NVDA of course. Then at the start of this year I invested a little bit in NVDA, which helped me catch up with the run up to 1k per share. Over the last few weeks I added to both NVDA and SMH, so I am currently overweighting NVDA vs the SMH exposure.There are plenty of names that are worth watching in the semi sector, not just AMD.
