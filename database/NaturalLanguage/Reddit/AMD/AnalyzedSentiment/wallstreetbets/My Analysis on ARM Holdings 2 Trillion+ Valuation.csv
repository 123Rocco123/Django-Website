,"I believe ARM Holdings is slept on! I believe it could be the next NVIDIA. As of this writing its Market Cap is sitting at $142.36 Billion. I believe that its market cap should be ATLEAST 1 trillion due to the fact that it has an enormous market share of damn near if not more of 95% of the worlds smart device chips. What makes ARM unique is its business model. Their primary source of revenue is from the leasing of the design of the instruction set of computer chips. For those who dont know the instruction set is often referred to as an instruction set architecture (ISA), is a group of commands for a CPU in machine language. These commands tell the processor what operations to perform. Each instruction in the set specifies a particular operation to be performed on a specified set of data operands. The instruction set is fundamental to the design and functionality of computer chips, dictating how software communicates with hardware... So what is unique about this? Well I will tell you, these instruction sets are incredibly energy effecient compared to what is used currently for AI such as RISC or X86 etc. Currently NVIDIA is soaring because of the AI craze and its success has put light onto AMD, INTEL, SMCI etc but I believe ARM is a sleeper in my opinion. Their main source on revenue is through the royalties it recieves for leasing its designs. They can easily raise the royalty rate to increase their revenue stream anytime but there are some downsides. There customers could leave them and use other options. I dont think that is going to happen because lets face it their intellectual property is far better than any of the competition in terms of effeciency. AI is growing rapidly and one key expense is going to be energy consumption. Especially in these data centers. To my knowledge most data centers run on chips that use x86 from Intel. Those chips using that instruction set uses alot of energy. I believe data centers are looking to convert to a more energy effecient chip and when they do.... ENTER: ARM. Arm is currently used in almost all smart devices because again they are energy effecient. Why do we have longer battery life in a smart phones? Its because of ARM. What chips do electric cars use? ARM what instruction set does your microwave, fridge, washing machine use? ARM. Currently ARM is all over the portable device market but once they hit the data centers I believe there revenue is going to explode and therefore the market cap. There are major catalysts going down right now such as Microsoft partnering with them to make ARM based laptops and NVIDIA collaborating with them to make computers, not to mention that Tesla ordered a ton of NVIDIA chips that use ARM architecture. But my most bullish thing about ARM is what Jensen Huang said at Computex. He said that AI will eventually become physical in terms of robotics. Do you think those robotics need a energy sucker of a computerchip instruction set? No, the need the most energy effecient tech in todays age and that where ARM steps up right again. Currently we only use AI remotely (Chat GPT, Picture Generators, Etc.) but once we put AI into something physical and tangible such as robots to do everyday tasks those devices and robots need to run on the most advance and effecient software. I am currently looking at an outlook of 5-15 years and I am long on my position is this stock. We all seen what nvidia did and can only imagine what the next stock can yield the same returns and I think its ARM Holdings. Imagine going back to 2017 and investing into NVIDIA when the markect cap was the same as ARM now. Those returns look nice right if you have invested then. The time is now. Please keep in mind that i have not decided to go completely in depth of all of my research on ARM Holdings so please do your own. Also, I purposefully did not go into fundementals such as earnings and revenue on this. This is just my personal long term outlook on the research I have done. There are plenty more catalysts and risks out there so please DYOR. Feel free to comment!",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE

They can easily raise the royalty rate to increase their revenue stream anytime but there are some downsides. There customers could leave them and use other options. I dont think that is going to happen because lets face it their intellectual property is far better than any of the competition in terms of effeciency. AI is growing rapidly and one key expense is going to be energy consumption. Especially in these data centers. To my knowledge most data centers run on chips that use x86 from Intel. Those chips using that instruction set uses alot of energy. I believe data centers are looking to convert to a more energy effecient chip and when they do.... ENTER: ARM. Arm is currently used in almost all smart devices because again they are energy effecient. Why do we have longer battery life in a smart phones? Its because of ARM. What chips do electric cars use? ARM what instruction set does your microwave, fridge, washing machine use? ARM. Currently ARM is all over the portable device market but once they hit the data centers I believe there revenue is going to explode and therefore the market cap. There are major catalysts going down right now such as Microsoft partnering with them to make ARM based laptops and NVIDIA collaborating with them to make computers, not to mention that Tesla ordered a ton of NVIDIA chips that use ARM architecture. But my most bullish thing about ARM is what Jensen Huang said at Computex. He said that AI will eventually become physical in terms of robotics. Do you think those robotics need a energy sucker of a computerchip instruction set? No, the need the most energy effecient tech in todays age and that where ARM steps up right again. Currently we only use AI remotely (Chat GPT, Picture Generators, Etc.) but once we put AI into something physical and tangible such as robots to do everyday tasks those devices and robots need to run on the most advance and effecient software. I am currently looking at an outlook of 5-15 years and I am long on my position is this stock.

Imagine going back to 2017 and investing into NVIDIA when the markect cap was the same as ARM now. Those returns look nice right if you have invested then. The time is now.

,"I believe ARM Holdings is slept on! I believe it could be the next NVIDIA. As of this writing its Market Cap is sitting at $142.36 Billion. I believe that its market cap should be ATLEAST 1 trillion due to the fact that it has an enormous market share of damn near if not more of 95% of the worlds smart device chips. What makes ARM unique is its business model. Their primary source of revenue is from the leasing of the design of the instruction set of computer chips. For those who dont know the instruction set is often referred to as an instruction set architecture (ISA), is a group of commands for a CPU in machine language. These commands tell the processor what operations to perform. Each instruction in the set specifies a particular operation to be performed on a specified set of data operands. The instruction set is fundamental to the design and functionality of computer chips, dictating how software communicates with hardware... So what is unique about this? Well I will tell you, these instruction sets are incredibly energy effecient compared to what is used currently for AI such as RISC or X86 etc. Currently NVIDIA is soaring because of the AI craze and its success has put light onto AMD, INTEL, SMCI etc but I believe ARM is a sleeper in my opinion. Their main source on revenue is through the royalties it recieves for leasing its designs. They can easily raise the royalty rate to increase their revenue stream anytime but there are some downsides. There customers could leave them and use other options. I dont think that is going to happen because lets face it their intellectual property is far better than any of the competition in terms of effeciency. AI is growing rapidly and one key expense is going to be energy consumption. Especially in these data centers. To my knowledge most data centers run on chips that use x86 from Intel. Those chips using that instruction set uses alot of energy. I believe data centers are looking to convert to a more energy effecient chip and when they do.... ENTER: ARM. Arm is currently used in almost all smart devices because again they are energy effecient. Why do we have longer battery life in a smart phones? Its because of ARM. What chips do electric cars use? ARM what instruction set does your microwave, fridge, washing machine use? ARM. Currently ARM is all over the portable device market but once they hit the data centers I believe there revenue is going to explode and therefore the market cap. There are major catalysts going down right now such as Microsoft partnering with them to make ARM based laptops and NVIDIA collaborating with them to make computers, not to mention that Tesla ordered a ton of NVIDIA chips that use ARM architecture. But my most bullish thing about ARM is what Jensen Huang said at Computex. He said that AI will eventually become physical in terms of robotics. Do you think those robotics need a energy sucker of a computerchip instruction set? No, the need the most energy effecient tech in todays age and that where ARM steps up right again. Currently we only use AI remotely (Chat GPT, Picture Generators, Etc.) but once we put AI into something physical and tangible such as robots to do everyday tasks those devices and robots need to run on the most advance and effecient software. I am currently looking at an outlook of 5-15 years and I am long on my position is this stock. We all seen what nvidia did and can only imagine what the next stock can yield the same returns and I think its ARM Holdings.

I am currently looking at an outlook of 5-15 years and I am long on my position is this stock. We all seen what nvidia did and can only imagine what the next stock can yield the same returns and I think its ARM Holdings. Imagine going back to 2017 and investing into NVIDIA when the markect cap was the same as ARM now. Those returns look nice right if you have invested then. The time is now. Please keep in mind that i have not decided to go completely in depth of all of my research on ARM Holdings so please do your own. Also, I purposefully did not go into fundementals such as earnings and revenue on this. This is just my personal long term outlook on the research I have done. There are plenty more catalysts and risks out there so please DYOR. Feel free to comment!",Smartphones are so passé,0,0.497,0.999,NEGATIVE
