,300 shares around $25 I tend to add another 700 shares before the end of year.,"How could anyone trust this company after the Hindenburg Research report?

,300 shares around $25 I tend to add another 700 shares before the end of year.,"Recently: Stock price dropped from $60 to $40 in the week leading up to the release of Hindenburg report on Aug 27. But not after release? Stock price stagnates at $40 until their auditing firm, Ernst & Young, resigns at the end of Oct. Stock then drops to $25.Your recently upward volatility is related to small reports that they will be able to submit reports (late?) to the SEC. I think SEC may not put gold star next to SMCI this quarter report card.It should be noted that Deloitte was their auditor for 20 years before being dismissed in 2023.Source for some info: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/anyone-crazy-enough-audit-super-110000106.html",2,0.541,NEGATIVE,0.999

,300 shares around $25 I tend to add another 700 shares before the end of year.,Risk/reward on this is too good to pass up. One day soon it will rocket on no news in the middle of a trading day. It’s a $50 stock at min and if we project forward it can hang at the $100 mark easy.
