,"I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong. $AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice. $NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were. And so in true wsb fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB. There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long. From a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about. And so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry : If you are under 40 years old, $HOOD (Finance), $PLTR (Defense) and $DKNG (gambling) will 100x during your investment horizon.

A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB. There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry.

Part 2 tomorrow as I dive deeper on all 3.","On the point of replication, I completely disagree. Why do you think the incumbents (Fidelity, Schwab) can get away with their shitty UI and tech? The regulatory hurdles, expertise, brand, and operational expertise needed to operate a brokerage at scale is hard to replicate for any upstarts. WeBull is the only one remotely close in market share and their Chinese affiliation will always limit them.Just getting licensed to be a brokerage is significantly more difficult than an average tech startup. Not to mention the economies of scale you need to start actually getting benefits from other deploying other financial products like credit cards, retirement account, financial advisory, different financial products like futures The latter is actually the only reason other brokerage firms still dominate, their network effects, regulatory moat, and the fact that millions of Americans basically have their 401Ks tied up with them.Now can the incumbents replicate the tech easily? I don't think so. They don't hire engineers or general employees of the same caliber. They have no desire to either at the company level. Fidelity is the largest and it's still privately owned, operated by a family of rich billionaire heirs who don't want to rock the boat. They have zero incentive to innovate here.Look at software engineer positions on LinkedIn at those old financial institutions, they are often low paid compared to Robinhood which pays pretty top tier in Silicon Valley. Robinhood has been around for almost a decade now, and has been mainstream since 2021 Fidelity still can't build a comparable mobile app with the amount of features they are pushing out. HOOD is building faster with way less people. If you're a young smart engineer out of a top tier CS college, where would you go Fidelity or Robinhood? You can check actual employee profiles for both companies to see who's joining which.Sure I'm biased because I have some heavy positions, but I'm pretty bullish on the stock.",3,0.527,1.0,NEGATIVE

Part 2 tomorrow as I dive deeper on all 3.","The fact that webull, sofi, robinhood and more all came into buisness in the last 8 years is proof replication is easy. Robin Hood started zero commission trading within 2 years every platform (even banks) offered zero commission trading. Their are not patents in brokerages and since none of these brokerages are clearing houses their is no protection from replication or proprietary ownership a a “sweet new tech” I’m quoting my own thought here.Fidelity has innovated with their dashboard, crypto, educational products, and active trader pro I would continue to have this discussion with you but I don’t think you have been trading long enough to keep up with the discussion.When robinhood started it started like Facebook. It was invite only and wasn’t backed by a charter I’m talking 2017/2018 they got outside investors to front them cash flow (citadel) and just ran a tech platform that sold data to citadel the customer never even owned the stock. This is why you can’t drip with robinhood you can only set up reinvesting plans (there is a difference and it matters in taxes)Other online brokerages that have apps most definitely hire engineers how do you think the app started? Same with Reddit pages people complain on a Reddit page about an app glitch or recommend an improvement the page moderator tells the tech team and they work on it. Fidelity baskets is an example of this in action. If you don’t know what that is it’s a way to make your own ETF. Pick the stocks you want pick the percent you want then when you invest it auto buys whole and fractional shares to match your basket.Robin Hood is definitely the most innovative brokerage, they cater to a newer investor, which is great I can’t state it strong enough Robin Hood really did open investing to all and I am a stock holder of them in that principle I think it’s amazing. That said they don’t have any literacy tools, offer little education and open investors to any risk level despite their ignorance. I say that to say this. Other app based platforms like cashapp, PayPal, and sofi are all looking to or doing the same thing as hood they are also tech firms at heart and other bigger institutions like intercontinental exchange are partnering and opening subsidiaries to compete in the app based investing because those who trade on apps are trading small amount of money often and there is a boat load of cash sitting in those bid ask spreads that fractional share buyers get destroyed on. TBH there will be robinhood users who read this and have to google bid vs ask to see what I’m talking about. I think hood has done a great job and I tip my hat to them.

How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice. $NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were. And so in true wsb fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB. There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long. From a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about.

Today all brokerages over $0 commission trading. The ship has sailed for $HOOD to become a revolutionary company.$PLTR - This stock has potential to grow however they are very sketchy and secretive. The CEO says some evil things sometimes which I guess is okay since the US military is supposed to be tough. I think this stock is a good pick but as stated before they are very secretive so I dont know exactly what they do. It could be bullshit ""AI"" software for the military that can be succeeded by the other defense companies. Or it could be really unique defense systems AI software that means this stock would be a multi-bagger in the future.$DKNG - Gambling is a good industry, however I do not know enough about it to comment on this stock. They are basically a online betting app. I dont think its hard to copy what they do , there are lots of overseas betting apps that just are not legal in the USA but can offer what draft kings offers already.",0,0.549,0.999,NEGATIVE
