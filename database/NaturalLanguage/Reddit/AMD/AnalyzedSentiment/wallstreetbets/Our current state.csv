,Possible major price correction in the near future or small market wide pullback for a bigger bull run? Genuinely curious on what your guys' thoughts are.,"See, here's the thing, time and time again people have been saying x stock is too high, and we're due for a pull back. Opinions are what hold 99% or traders back as the stock market doesn't care what you think.As of right now on spy, we are above a rising 20, 50, 150, and 200 simple moving average (historically speaking this is where stocks make huge moves), and that's all you need to know for the current trend. I'm not saying it will keep going up indefinitely, but as it stands now, there's no reason to be bearish.",2,0.546,0.998,NEGATIVE
,Possible major price correction in the near future or small market wide pullback for a bigger bull run? Genuinely curious on what your guys' thoughts are.,"as it stands now, there's no reason to be bearish.Election, Taiwan-China bs, record breaking yield curve activity, boomers retiring/dying, stuff never before seen, crises of all kinds, lower class crumbling from inflation to the point Mcds has to bring back $5 meals again, and a whole bunch of other crap. White collar recession. Tech sector, that I'm in, is absolutely insane right now. Layoffs, outsourcing, and most importantly, lack of job postings. Guess what happens when white collar jobs are hit. It trickles down to everyone else because we're the ones that spend the $$.All it takes is pretty much a single black swan event, or a collection of factors that all work together to bleed companies out eventually (such as high interest rates are currently). It's not that I'm saying the market doesn't go up long term, but what I'm saying is there is such a thing as ""collecting profits"" and ""cycles"" and there is currently quite a lot of profit to be made once the bigwigs sell.We get so disillusioned by the insane endless stream of +1% days, that nobody is able to handle the circuit breaker days where it's just red after red. And forget that, there could be a third option, just stagnation. We could hover around 490s-low 500s for years.",3,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE
,Possible major price correction in the near future or small market wide pullback for a bigger bull run? Genuinely curious on what your guys' thoughts are.,"You clearly didn't read what I said. In current conditions, you should not be bearish on spy. I gave my reasoning and explicitly stated that it doesn't mean it'll continue going up. All those reasons you stated are why YOU think the market will tank. Like I said, the market doesn't care about your opinions.I will become bearish when the market (spy specifically) shows a trend change. I will not change my opinion because someone(s) tells me their opinion on how they think the market should be acting.",4,0.564,1.0,NEGATIVE
