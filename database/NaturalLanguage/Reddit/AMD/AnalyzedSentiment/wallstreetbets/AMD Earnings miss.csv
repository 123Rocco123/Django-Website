They said they're scrapping RDNA in favor of UDNA, which is going to present a lot of complexity and hurdles in their gaming GPU development. They might try to target high-end, but for at least the first few generations of UDNA it will be a miracle feat if they manage to actually release something that competes with the Nvidia XX90.",5,0.54,NEGATIVE,0.996

,,"Listen, the reason they are down is that they only increased revenue in the midst of the AI bubble by 20-30%. They could do that in a normal good year. The fact that it wasn't 50%+ is why they are down.Don't let any random article tell you differently. In the height of the AI bubble, it is expected that a company selling AI silicon should be popping off like gangbusters and they are simply doing ok/good.",0,0.592,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,midst of the AI bubble by 20-30%They had in the ballpark of $100m in AI revenue prior to this year. How many other AI companies went from effectively zero to $5bn?

There was an insane amount of buying pressure and they seem to be gaining some traction.Check out the move from DHI today, I'd expect something similar and think this selloff was MM bait due to hyper bullishness.

,,"AMD is a long term play.Imagine a day where they make the announcement ""CUDA can now run on AMD hardware."" Instant rocket ship to the moon. I doubt that will ever happen, but eventually they will have something that is a viable alternative to Nvidia GPUs in data centers, and they'll very very quickly start gaining market share.Right now they really don't have shit. Their CPUs are great, but those are priced in.",0,0.551,POSITIVE,0.999
,,They already have ROCm,1,0.515,POSITIVE,0.914
,,"Right but it's not a viable alternative when all the software is built for CUDA. Nvidia spend a decade and lots of money incentivizing researchers, professors, grad students to get familiar with CUDA. Do all their research with CUDA. They even put CUDA cores on low-end consumer GPUs so that the masses could afford it and experiment with it, even though there was really no reason to add it to mass-market consumer cards like that.So AMD either needs their cards to run CUDA (not likely, they had ZLUDA but recently killed the project) or they need all the big core AI software stacks to start supporting ROCm. Some day it probably will, and at that point, we will start to see AMD enter the market in a big way.",2,0.538,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,Yeah I meant they have something similar but it didn't help them success(yet?),3,0.503,POSITIVE,0.671
,,"I don't understand where all of the Nvidia cards are going if the big server companies are not tracking the same growth. You cannot buy an Nvidia card and just throw it into an existing server. Sadly, they are ordered with specific power supplies and cooling to support these cards. If anyone wants to buy and run a Nvidia card for anything, it needs a new server with an Intel or AMD processor in it.To make it more profitable for Intel and AMD, you can only stack a handful of the Nvidia cards into a server and the server requires two processors minimum to fully populate the PCI bus with enough bandwidth for the cards. It's almost a two Nvidia card for each one processor. If Nvidia sells 100,000 cards, we better see at least 50,000 server class CPUs sold.",0,0.557,NEGATIVE,0.999
