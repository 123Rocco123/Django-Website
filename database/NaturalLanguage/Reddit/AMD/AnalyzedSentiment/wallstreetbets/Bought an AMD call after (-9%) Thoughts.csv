,"30 day expiry, I think AMD can recover and then some tbh what u guys think?","What‚Äôs your DD on AMD? I see hyperscalers with their own designs & Nvidia eroding AMD & Intel server share which will only get worse as time goes on. I think AMD & Intel Products will battle it out for a smaller market with enterprise customers in the future. Which basically leaves AMD with its gaming revenue, which is declining.",0,0.605,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"30 day expiry, I think AMD can recover and then some tbh what u guys think?","AMD Epyc is according to Jemsen still the best CPU to pair NVidia GPUs with. Epyc CPUs are a good product and they will take market share from Intel. Zen 6 and 7 look promising so far. Insticts architecture allows for better yields than Blackwell. AMD might be behind now, but they also were behind Intel, when they launched Zen1 a couple of years ago. Also combining rDna and cDna into uDna is a smart move for now. nVidia clearly has won the mindshare, but AMD will be positioned well with MI400. Also, hyperscalers making their own chips is nice and everything, but they'll still employ AMD and NVidia.With Arm and Qualcomm having a legal dispute and Intel being Intel, AMD is well positioned to gain laptop/mobile market share.Speaking of Laptop, AMD currently has the best APUs with the best iGPU for Laptop. They will most likely make low to mid tier discrete gpu obsolete, esp. in the mobile market. I see this as an opportunity for AMD to win consumer gpu market share over time. Also given the recent decline in gpu market share, i think scalimg down effords to develop new gaming gpu is the right move now.AMD is producing the PS5 Pro APUs and seemingly won the PS 6 contract. With GTA6 releasing next year or 2026, gaming will be ok.the next couple of moths might be rough, but CES2025 will bring a lot of good news.",1,0.58,POSITIVE,1.0
