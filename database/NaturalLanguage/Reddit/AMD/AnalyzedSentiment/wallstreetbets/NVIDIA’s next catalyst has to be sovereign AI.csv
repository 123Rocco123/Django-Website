,"NVIDIA’s current valuation is not overtly expensive (FPER: 33, PEG: 1.61 according to FINVIZ) and the GPU orders for next year are all booked. Yet the stock is meeting strong resistance around $130. I think this is partially because a lot of people have been burned by CISCO during dot-com bubble and do not want to price in the future too much. But the real concern is that their revenue is almost entirely dependent on the rest of M7 and they are charging the big tech 80 % margin. The big tech, while being hammered by Wall Street for the increased CAPEX spending, indicated during last earning that they will not reduce their investment on AI. However, they did mention that they are/plan using their NPU (Google TPU, Tesla Dojo, AMD) to reduce the usage of NVIDIA GPU. Furthermore, GPT5 and Apple Intelligence should be available to the public by the end of this year. If these do not impress, the entire AI sector may see significant slowdown. But if GPT5 shows plateauing of performance while people find Apple Intelligence interesting, paradigm could shift toward smaller models and inference efficiency, again reducing the demand for NVIDIA. To justify significant increase in NVIDIA’s stock price, they need to show that they are not entirely dependent on the Big Tech. The only other potential buyers that have as much buying power are governments. Also, if the economy is going through downturns, governments have excuse to increase their spending. What I am paying attention to during the earning call is demonstration from NVIDIA that they are receiving significant demand from non-Big Tech such as governments.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE
