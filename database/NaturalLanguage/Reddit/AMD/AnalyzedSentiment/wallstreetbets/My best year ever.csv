I’ll share my indicator stack and my favorite setups at the end but I first will share something I think is far more important: Home Court AdvantageI only trade in market conditions where I have “home court advantage”. Everyone trades better in certain market conditions and worse in others. But MOST people don’t think about identifying which conditions they’re better in. So they’ve been training to be professional snipers and don’t realize they’re trading in a close-range gang shoot out.Don’t be someone who trades every week of the year and expects the market to stay the same or “you’re good enough” to consistently win in all conditions. Every successful professional trader I know specializes. Maybe it’s only day trading SPX first 30-60 minutes of the day, or only trading one sector, or only trading when VIX gets above a certain level.So my main home court is pre-earnings season. About 1 month prior to the big tech earnings season. this means I only trade about 4-6 months a year. Sometimes I skip a season too. A perfect cadence for swing trading and trade/life balance.Why this season for me? I find that earnings are the only medium term, consistent event in stocks we can count on happening at a regular cadence. That is a very rare characteristic to have when operating in a random market. Nothing in the markets are predictable, except we KNOW earnings will bring about high volatility and attention. And the month leading up to that is always going from lower vol to higher vol conditions. This is the sweet spot I’ve found myself performing best inFind your home court.My indicator stack is simple:20, 50, 200 SMATTM Squeeze indicatorVolume profileRSIMACDAgain, I believe every indicator is just a tool and one is not better than another. They’re just better for different conditions and trading stylesSetups:I like to enter trades during a time of sideways consolidation. This is identified by the Squeeze indicator. When a stock is “squeezing” sideways on multiple time frames, it’s even better. The longer the squeeze, the larger the subsequent move. The direction I take depends on my assessment of the trend and market conditions. During pre-earnings periods, it’s usually going long these days.Fallen Angels. Finding Stocks in a LTF downward trend that for some reason gap DOWN again in total capitulation. I then wait for these to go sideways for months, and everyone has dumped in total panic and despair. They’ve forgotten about it. And then wait for the SMA’s and volume to give me a trigger to enter near the bottom and set a stop loss below the All time low. Also monitor if insiders begin to buy.short term, basic reversal trades at key resistance or support areas. For example if a stock or index hits its 50 month or 200 week moving averages with speed. That’s usually an easy put I can sell for a relatively quick win. (Not buying calls, I’d stick to selling puts for something like that)Or another example would be shorting stocks in the same sector where several tickets are all hitting SMA resistances like AMD and NVDA did August 1st. These are MEANT to be base hits. Sometimes it’s a home run outta no where like my Aug 1st NVDA trade but normally I just expect like a 10-20% gainThat’s about it. It’s pretty boring and simple with complexities due to my personal style.I mentor a few folks as a side gig (nothing extravagant) and usually when I try to teach them my style, it doesn’t work. But it at least gives them a framework to work off of. Long term, I’m just helping them get smaller, simpler, and more specialized in their trading. When you get more specialized, your volume of trades lowers but the quality of your trades sky rocketsBest of luck!",1,0.531,0.689,POSITIVE

Best book that changed the trajectory of my trading. It helped me understand that the key to success in trading is ALL psychological.The secret to success in trading is not having a trading plans, being smarter or working harder. It is in getting to a mental maturity level where you can actually follow your trading plan, and where you know when to take yourself out of the game in order to protect your portfolio from yourselfI have been trading for 14 years and I haven’t been consistently profitable until after the 10 year mark. I’m maybe a little more intelligent now than I used to be. The biggest difference is my maturity now compared to before.I have learned to identify when I’m not in the right mindset to trade well and make good decisions. I force myself to stop trading or lower my position sizes when I’m too excited, confident, regretful, or sad about buying a dip that keeps dipping.And I can also tell when I am in a good mindset to make big conviction bets.These are all subtle things I had to learn about myself over 10,000 hours of failing/mediocrity/round tripping. It’s not something I can teach you bc every human reacts to external stress and their emotions differentlyI’m not saying we should be “unemotional” either. That’s a fallacy. We are humans and we cannot just stop feeling things. We can only control our actions and change our environment so that we are in the best mental state for success.TLDR: Give the book a read.

I gotta KNOW I’m not revenge trading to make up a loss or cocky trading after a recent win. After about a week, I’ve forgotten how much I made or loss and I’ve calmed downIdeally the last several trades I made were small or insignificantIf the setup which I want to take a big conviction bet on is one I’ve been watching or keeping an eye out for a few weeks or monthsI don’t feel like I need to make this money (trading exclusively out of retirement accounts basically locks this in for me)I’m in a good place relationally with my wifeThese are things specific to me and I wouldn’t say it’s necessary for anyone else. While it may seem unnecessarily cumbersome and silly, it’s what works for me.I do hear “what if the perfect setup happens when you’re in an argument? You’re just gonna skip it?” Yes.
