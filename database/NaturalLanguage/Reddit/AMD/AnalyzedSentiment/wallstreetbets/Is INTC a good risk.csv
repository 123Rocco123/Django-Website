,Valuation close to NAV (incl. intangibles) New CEO about to be appointed will bring a boost in morale Restructuring and cost reduction strategies already ongoing Intel 18A having promising performance numbers quality of chip comparable to that of AMD some bigger company might come in and buy Worth the risk?,"In this case I don't think it matters.Flat out either Intel lands 18A or it's toast. If it lands it yeah 40 in a year is easy.If they don't, they have so much assets they'll sell for more than they are worth at the current stock price.Fabs sq ft alone they have ~10M sq ft cleanroom space. The Az and Oregon mega sites are likely worth 20B a piece alone due to tooling and building.Its surprising they aren't being actively bought by competitors.Which should be a concern they may go the bankruptcy vs succes route. The competitors are waiting for a confirmed fire sale.But again even if that happens I expect 25 to 30 bucks a share acquisition.Which 18A is full production in Jan. So well know in 6 months or so from now.*And that's ignoring insane shit like Google, AWS(who has prepurchased 1000s of wafers of 18A foundry) finally getting tired of having to ask TSMC for wafers from Nvidia. An AMD merger. Or Taiwan being attacked (100 over night if that happens).",2,0.532,NEGATIVE,1.0

I could see any of the big server chip groups gobbling them up. So Google, AWS, etc.I could see AMD making a run at a merger if they can't get traction against Nvidia/AI items. Wherein AMD/INTEL merge and Intel manufacturing gets the Global Foundry treatment at the end of the Chips act requirements.Also possibly Nvidia. They've been semi-public with the concerns over TSMC being a sole supplier. But again, expect a ""quick"" spin off of foundry afterwards.For Google, this wouldn't be the first time either.

But they are falling FAST in graphics.Nvidia has wiped the floor with everyone and to both INTC and AMDs credit. Its a down year for semis. The AI bubble is all that's kept Nvidia and TSMC soaring.*ASML on the other hand now has a permanent monopoly on EUV. If they can get to the next big litho scanner they'll print money.

AMD was never the benchmark for GPUs. AMD was always the value option in gaming, especially with the 580 series. And AMD still operates in that zone.AMD was super small in comparison to Nvidia and Intel back when Ryzen launched. They correctly chose to pick one front to fight on instead of fighting two fronts as the underdog.AMD focused their R&D & software support into retail CPUs and didn’t invest as much into their GPU lines.Maybe that will change as they get their foothold, but they obviously have a large task ahead.",2,0.562,NEGATIVE,1.0

And it'll stay that way. Their IP moat is a desert.They are too far behind in ai chips to make any gains - even if they had S-tier hardware today it would take years for any chunk of the industry to build software around it similarly to what Nvidia has.Their ARC gpus are the first semi-serviceable gpu they have made....well, ever. At least since the 90s. And it still falls behind competition in every benchmark.They are a company that makes desktop/laptop/server CPUs. And serviceable integrated graphics. 10 years ago they were the same thing. 10 years from now they will be the same thing. Growth is limited compared to AMD, NVDA and others that are branching out.

Long term I see 50+ possible at the end of the year. 18A in the market, Panther lake returning silicon back to Intel Foundry, Clearwater forest being a clear datacenter winner, Falcon shores maybe making some revenue, and whatever they can cook up for desktop (Bartlett lake 8P core?).2024 was always going to be the worst of it. Meteor Lake was a good stepping stone and helped resolve a lot of foundry issues while bringing revenue, but they need a crown jewel.OFC, 18A could flop with the next iteration (A-P) being a year removed. Panther lake could be a dud. Falcon Shores might be more of the same from Intels AI offerings. CPUs may not matter in datacenter by the release date. Equipment costs can drown Intel.
