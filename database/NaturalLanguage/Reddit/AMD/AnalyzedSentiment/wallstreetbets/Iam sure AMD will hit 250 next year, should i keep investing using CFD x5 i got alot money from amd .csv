,,"Bro is a dropshipper...Yeah, that investment in AMD is perfect! Strong company, will go to $200 EOY.Next year I'm thinking $400 at least. Go all in and don't limit yourself on the leverage if you don't want to miss out. x100 seems reasonable.In 2026 it'll take over the semi industry and will have higher market cap than Nvidia. Good luck lil bro!",0,0.595,0.988,POSITIVE

,,"On a serious note however, don't do it. Half a year back AMD was trading in the $180 range for weeks and then it started to go downhill.If you believe AMD could grow as a semiconductor company then buy shares and hold for years.In the recent months was NO POINT at which you would've been better off buying AMD rather than Nvidia. Nvidia was making new ATHs while AMD kept declining (might not be necessarily true in the recent month or two, but that's because AMD had already fallen so much: 35% fall from ATH, while Nvidia had already gained top 1 global market cap)As for now AMD is somewhat rising but it's only because Nvidia is rising as well.",2,0.605,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,"Just buy some long running call options.I am also pretty sure AMD will go up. Recent actions taken clearly shows they finally opened their hunting season for the AI hardware market.And since AMD was always the number one competitor to Intel and nvidia (ever since they acquired ATI) in the consumer sector, there will be no shortcoming of a battle here soon as well.AMD seems absolutely dedicated to get some market share and the initiatives alone, independent from the actual outcome, will boost investor sentiment further and any positive progress news will let the stock surge.That is what I expect with very high confidence.No investment advice.",0,0.568,0.997,POSITIVE

,,"Not sure why the optimism on AMD. On the CPU side, the Zen5 chips aren't flying off the shelves. With any luck, the 9800X3D will be a good chip, and offer substantial gains, as opposed to the non-3D chips released so far.On the GPU side of things, Nvidia is eating their lunch so much that AMD has publicly noped out of the high-end consumer market. That probably doesn't bode well for the enterprise side of things either then, as those customers are willing to pay far more for the extra power.AMD is gonna have a hard time catching up to Nvidia, and it will be at least another generation of them getting curbstomped by the Nvidia parts. The 5090's only competition might be the 4090.I think AMD is in a solid position, especially with regards to the mid-to-low-end market. But the sectors that are making the money are the high end and enterprise level stuff, and that's all Nvidia. Hell, Intel might have a more compelling offering on the GPU side than AMD, if Battlemage ends up being solid. Granny might get her lick back after all.",0,0.552,0.996,NEGATIVE

,,"For revenue, yes, but isn't the stock price going to be steered heavily by ""prestige"" of the brand? Retail investors are going to know the commercial side better than the enterprise side. Or maybe I just don't appreciate the level of sophistication of retail investors today.That said, I don't own AMD stock. It just doesn't make sense to me, given Nvidia dominates bother the commercial and enterprise sides of the market.Intel might be an interesting okay, given their price right now.",2,0.576,1.0,NEGATIVE
