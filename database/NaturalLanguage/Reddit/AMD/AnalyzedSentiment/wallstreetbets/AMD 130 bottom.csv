Thoughts?","One other huge bonus about AMD's next earnings is that the Xilinx amortization will have been fully digested by then right?For example, you look at it's current P/E, like 122, but it's forward P/E is like 27.How is this possible? It's because the Xilinx amortization will have been fully digested and it's P/E will normalize and won't look so ridiculous in comparison to NVDA and others.Institutional buyers know this already (the smart ones at least), but AMD has always been insanely popular with retail traders for whatever reason.I think retail traders don't really know and understand the whole Xilinx amortization scenario, so they just look at the P/E and think, ""OH MY GOD IT's SO OVERVALUED!""Not realizing that it's real P/E is actually considerably lower.When some rando retail investor goes onto Yahoo Finance in February 2025 and sees that the P/E is like 45 instead of 150, they might be like...

Then there is the whole software issue the AMD still after a decade still has not addressed which Nvidia still has a leg up on.
