,"Bro. I saw AMD was 'lagging' on its correction compared to other chips in pre-market. It was down by 'only' 5 % while almost every one else was at or close to double digit. My regarded as couldn't wait until opening of main session. My regarded ash didn't consider maybe AMD is gaining where Intel is losing. So I jump in with a Short while it hit -6%. Went well for half an hour, gaining 15% profit (I always x5). Then big pump arrived half an hour before main session. I didn't check price in the first 15 min and when I did my +15 has changed to -40%. I would have hold it for a day or two because I think it will fall. But Etoro requires SL for CFD and the lowest is -50%. I hit -50%. All of this after I got my first 50% gain week last week bro. I thought I've turned a page. It will take me probably 2 months to get to where I was. Or maybe 1 month to 0. Well I guess at least I'm not betting my saving (or inheritance)",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE
