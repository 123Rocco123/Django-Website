,,"Personally im selling my 50 NVDA shares at an avg prce of $78 probably close to earnings at around $134 since I really don't think NVDA will have much more upside. By the time AI becomes very very profitable, I think a handful of years still, there will be other competitors. NVDA upside is not much more. But Im holding AMD as its likely the only competitor that has a chance.",0,0.54,0.999,NEGATIVE
,,"I'm not saying the stock will not tank at any time between now and the future, but the fact remains that CUDA is a huge advantage that NVDA has over others. It's not just the chips, its the software, and no other large player has a product that can compete. Maybe in few years, but that's a big maybe. It will be difficult for anyone to dethrone NVDA here, and its mostly due to software, not hardware.",1,0.549,0.999,NEGATIVE
