,"Intro: Many of you are probably pretty tired of $AMD. The last 8 or so months of downtrend is pretty deterring, especially while $NVDA continues to tear upwards. You're also probably tired of seeing hopium posts in the midst of tons of bear posts. I think most agree that fundamentally $AMD is a great company that should not be negative YTD. For those of you that have been waiting a long time to see it catch a bid off of the AI hype and necessity for chips, I think the wait is coming to an end. It's easy to point at the institutions and hedge funds and blame them for nuking the price, but hopefully with this thesis I can show that $AMD structurally is ready to reverse. To the untrained eye, the chart displayed should be easy to read, you can see the similarities between the two corrections quite easily. If any of you see any holes in this thesis please let me know. ""but institutional buying/selling, unusual options, market dominance,"" Yea IDGAF about all that, just let me know if there are holes in the technical analysis. If you don't want to read, I'll sum it up briefly: AMD will bottom at $114-$121, followed by an HTF extension to $330. Length of Corrections, Fibonacci Levels, Timing of Earnings & Structure: The first correction pictured lasted ~315 days, bottoming ~21 days from prior to earnings. The current correction is pacing to also finish within the golden pocket ($114-$122, where institutions have most interest in buying), matching the length of the previous correction and also ~21 days off of the next earnings. Earnings are marked in blue vertical lines on the chart. As you can see with our current correction, we are likely in the final wave of our ABCDE correction. There is a small chance we could skip the golden pocket and shoot for the 0.236 @ $96, but this is quite unlikely. The run up that followed the previous correction saw price top at $227, nearly touching our 1.618 extension at $232. If we see the same process unfold: A bounce and run up from the pocket, we could expect our 1.618 to be @ $333 per share, pictured in the top right. MACD & RSI: Once again, If you just study the structure of the MACD underneath the two corrections, it is easy to see how close they are in form. I'm not going to attempt to explain each cross and describe what I am seeing in words, the charts speak for themselves for MACD. RSI during the previous correction saw a low highlighted in green at the bottom at 32. The previous two run ups both peaked at 82, and I would like to think it is highly likely RSI will bottom at 32 again, currently sitting at 39. This one it is also easy to see the similarities in structure on the chart. MACD and RSI showing the same structure as the last correction before a 300% run with a bottom going into earnings is possibly the most bullish copy and paste set up I have seen in a long time. Conclusion: I don't wish to spread more lackluster hopium for this stock. I am trying to make the point that structurally, if it were to bottom and reverse, within the next month would be the most logical place for this to occur. Hopefully, those that have been burned holding this stock understand that it simply just needed time to cool off after that 300% run. Once markets find the price has been pushed low enough it should begin another, it's literally illustrated in the charts. I could be wrong. There could be more downside after the golden pocket, but this is a play I am willing to lose money on because it meets every checkmark presented from an analysis view. If it folds I cannot be upset because I stuck with the rules and didn't put money somewhere else that didn't look as structurally sound.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

,"Intro: Many of you are probably pretty tired of $AMD. The last 8 or so months of downtrend is pretty deterring, especially while $NVDA continues to tear upwards. You're also probably tired of seeing hopium posts in the midst of tons of bear posts. I think most agree that fundamentally $AMD is a great company that should not be negative YTD. For those of you that have been waiting a long time to see it catch a bid off of the AI hype and necessity for chips, I think the wait is coming to an end. It's easy to point at the institutions and hedge funds and blame them for nuking the price, but hopefully with this thesis I can show that $AMD structurally is ready to reverse. To the untrained eye, the chart displayed should be easy to read, you can see the similarities between the two corrections quite easily. If any of you see any holes in this thesis please let me know. ""but institutional buying/selling, unusual options, market dominance,"" Yea IDGAF about all that, just let me know if there are holes in the technical analysis. If you don't want to read, I'll sum it up briefly: AMD will bottom at $114-$121, followed by an HTF extension to $330. Length of Corrections, Fibonacci Levels, Timing of Earnings & Structure: The first correction pictured lasted ~315 days, bottoming ~21 days from prior to earnings. The current correction is pacing to also finish within the golden pocket ($114-$122, where institutions have most interest in buying), matching the length of the previous correction and also ~21 days off of the next earnings. Earnings are marked in blue vertical lines on the chart. As you can see with our current correction, we are likely in the final wave of our ABCDE correction. There is a small chance we could skip the golden pocket and shoot for the 0.236 @ $96, but this is quite unlikely. The run up that followed the previous correction saw price top at $227, nearly touching our 1.618 extension at $232. If we see the same process unfold: A bounce and run up from the pocket, we could expect our 1.618 to be @ $333 per share, pictured in the top right. MACD & RSI: Once again, If you just study the structure of the MACD underneath the two corrections, it is easy to see how close they are in form. I'm not going to attempt to explain each cross and describe what I am seeing in words, the charts speak for themselves for MACD. RSI during the previous correction saw a low highlighted in green at the bottom at 32. The previous two run ups both peaked at 82, and I would like to think it is highly likely RSI will bottom at 32 again, currently sitting at 39.

I am trying to make the point that structurally, if it were to bottom and reverse, within the next month would be the most logical place for this to occur.

The current correction is pacing to also finish within the golden pocket ($114-$122, where institutions have most interest in buying), matching the length of the previous correction and also ~21 days off of the next earnings. Earnings are marked in blue vertical lines on the chart. As you can see with our current correction, we are likely in the final wave of our ABCDE correction. There is a small chance we could skip the golden pocket and shoot for the 0.236 @ $96, but this is quite unlikely. The run up that followed the previous correction saw price top at $227, nearly touching our 1.618 extension at $232. If we see the same process unfold: A bounce and run up from the pocket, we could expect our 1.618 to be @ $333 per share, pictured in the top right. MACD & RSI: Once again, If you just study the structure of the MACD underneath the two corrections, it is easy to see how close they are in form. I'm not going to attempt to explain each cross and describe what I am seeing in words, the charts speak for themselves for MACD. RSI during the previous correction saw a low highlighted in green at the bottom at 32. The previous two run ups both peaked at 82, and I would like to think it is highly likely RSI will bottom at 32 again, currently sitting at 39. This one it is also easy to see the similarities in structure on the chart. MACD and RSI showing the same structure as the last correction before a 300% run with a bottom going into earnings is possibly the most bullish copy and paste set up I have seen in a long time. Conclusion: I don't wish to spread more lackluster hopium for this stock. I am trying to make the point that structurally, if it were to bottom and reverse, within the next month would be the most logical place for this to occur. Hopefully, those that have been burned holding this stock understand that it simply just needed time to cool off after that 300% run. Once markets find the price has been pushed low enough it should begin another, it's literally illustrated in the charts. I could be wrong. There could be more downside after the golden pocket, but this is a play I am willing to lose money on because it meets every checkmark presented from an analysis view. If it folds I cannot be upset because I stuck with the rules and didn't put money somewhere else that didn't look as structurally sound.","NVIDIA acquired Mellanox. AMD acquired Xilinx and Pensando.Broadcom recently hyped for its inference accelerators, but I think AMD is the closest competitor to NVIDIA in terms of capabilities, price, and performance. AMD may even be more advanced than NVIDIA on the FPGA side because of Xilinx.One of AVGO’s potential pitfalls in 2025 is its lack of end-to-end product design and manufacturing. They sell chips and SDKs to OEMs, like the Tomahawk5 chipset to Arista (ANET) and others, but they don’t produce integrated systems. AMD on the other hand doesn’t design or manufacture network switches, which could be a weakness against NVIDIA’s vertically integrated approach.I think we’ll see system manufacturers and integrators look to a combination of AVGO, AMD and ANET to build end to end AI solutions. This won’t cover the abstractions that companies are looking for, like the “I want to use AI out of the box”, but I think we’re seeing a lot of new startups trying to tackle that problem.The current sentiment around AMD is low - everyone here feels burned by them.

I'm not going to attempt to explain each cross and describe what I am seeing in words, the charts speak for themselves for MACD.

,"Intro: Many of you are probably pretty tired of $AMD. The last 8 or so months of downtrend is pretty deterring, especially while $NVDA continues to tear upwards. You're also probably tired of seeing hopium posts in the midst of tons of bear posts. I think most agree that fundamentally $AMD is a great company that should not be negative YTD. For those of you that have been waiting a long time to see it catch a bid off of the AI hype and necessity for chips, I think the wait is coming to an end. It's easy to point at the institutions and hedge funds and blame them for nuking the price, but hopefully with this thesis I can show that $AMD structurally is ready to reverse. To the untrained eye, the chart displayed should be easy to read, you can see the similarities between the two corrections quite easily. If any of you see any holes in this thesis please let me know. ""but institutional buying/selling, unusual options, market dominance,"" Yea IDGAF about all that, just let me know if there are holes in the technical analysis. If you don't want to read, I'll sum it up briefly: AMD will bottom at $114-$121, followed by an HTF extension to $330. Length of Corrections, Fibonacci Levels, Timing of Earnings & Structure: The first correction pictured lasted ~315 days, bottoming ~21 days from prior to earnings. The current correction is pacing to also finish within the golden pocket ($114-$122, where institutions have most interest in buying), matching the length of the previous correction and also ~21 days off of the next earnings. Earnings are marked in blue vertical lines on the chart. As you can see with our current correction, we are likely in the final wave of our ABCDE correction. There is a small chance we could skip the golden pocket and shoot for the 0.236 @ $96, but this is quite unlikely. The run up that followed the previous correction saw price top at $227, nearly touching our 1.618 extension at $232.

The current correction is pacing to also finish within the golden pocket ($114-$122, where institutions have most interest in buying), matching the length of the previous correction and also ~21 days off of the next earnings. Earnings are marked in blue vertical lines on the chart. As you can see with our current correction, we are likely in the final wave of our ABCDE correction. There is a small chance we could skip the golden pocket and shoot for the 0.236 @ $96, but this is quite unlikely. The run up that followed the previous correction saw price top at $227, nearly touching our 1.618 extension at $232. If we see the same process unfold: A bounce and run up from the pocket, we could expect our 1.618 to be @ $333 per share, pictured in the top right. MACD & RSI: Once again, If you just study the structure of the MACD underneath the two corrections, it is easy to see how close they are in form. I'm not going to attempt to explain each cross and describe what I am seeing in words, the charts speak for themselves for MACD. RSI during the previous correction saw a low highlighted in green at the bottom at 32. The previous two run ups both peaked at 82, and I would like to think it is highly likely RSI will bottom at 32 again, currently sitting at 39. This one it is also easy to see the similarities in structure on the chart. MACD and RSI showing the same structure as the last correction before a 300% run with a bottom going into earnings is possibly the most bullish copy and paste set up I have seen in a long time. Conclusion: I don't wish to spread more lackluster hopium for this stock. I am trying to make the point that structurally, if it were to bottom and reverse, within the next month would be the most logical place for this to occur. Hopefully, those that have been burned holding this stock understand that it simply just needed time to cool off after that 300% run. Once markets find the price has been pushed low enough it should begin another, it's literally illustrated in the charts. I could be wrong. There could be more downside after the golden pocket, but this is a play I am willing to lose money on because it meets every checkmark presented from an analysis view.

,"Intro: Many of you are probably pretty tired of $AMD. The last 8 or so months of downtrend is pretty deterring, especially while $NVDA continues to tear upwards. You're also probably tired of seeing hopium posts in the midst of tons of bear posts. I think most agree that fundamentally $AMD is a great company that should not be negative YTD. For those of you that have been waiting a long time to see it catch a bid off of the AI hype and necessity for chips, I think the wait is coming to an end. It's easy to point at the institutions and hedge funds and blame them for nuking the price, but hopefully with this thesis I can show that $AMD structurally is ready to reverse. To the untrained eye, the chart displayed should be easy to read, you can see the similarities between the two corrections quite easily. If any of you see any holes in this thesis please let me know. ""but institutional buying/selling, unusual options, market dominance,"" Yea IDGAF about all that, just let me know if there are holes in the technical analysis. If you don't want to read, I'll sum it up briefly: AMD will bottom at $114-$121, followed by an HTF extension to $330. Length of Corrections, Fibonacci Levels, Timing of Earnings & Structure: The first correction pictured lasted ~315 days, bottoming ~21 days from prior to earnings. The current correction is pacing to also finish within the golden pocket ($114-$122, where institutions have most interest in buying), matching the length of the previous correction and also ~21 days off of the next earnings. Earnings are marked in blue vertical lines on the chart. As you can see with our current correction, we are likely in the final wave of our ABCDE correction. There is a small chance we could skip the golden pocket and shoot for the 0.236 @ $96, but this is quite unlikely. The run up that followed the previous correction saw price top at $227, nearly touching our 1.618 extension at $232. If we see the same process unfold: A bounce and run up from the pocket, we could expect our 1.618 to be @ $333 per share, pictured in the top right. MACD & RSI: Once again, If you just study the structure of the MACD underneath the two corrections, it is easy to see how close they are in form. I'm not going to attempt to explain each cross and describe what I am seeing in words, the charts speak for themselves for MACD. RSI during the previous correction saw a low highlighted in green at the bottom at 32. The previous two run ups both peaked at 82, and I would like to think it is highly likely RSI will bottom at 32 again, currently sitting at 39. This one it is also easy to see the similarities in structure on the chart. MACD and RSI showing the same structure as the last correction before a 300% run with a bottom going into earnings is possibly the most bullish copy and paste set up I have seen in a long time. Conclusion: I don't wish to spread more lackluster hopium for this stock. I am trying to make the point that structurally, if it were to bottom and reverse, within the next month would be the most logical place for this to occur. Hopefully, those that have been burned holding this stock understand that it simply just needed time to cool off after that 300% run.

Earnings are marked in blue vertical lines on the chart. As you can see with our current correction, we are likely in the final wave of our ABCDE correction. There is a small chance we could skip the golden pocket and shoot for the 0.236 @ $96, but this is quite unlikely. The run up that followed the previous correction saw price top at $227, nearly touching our 1.618 extension at $232. If we see the same process unfold: A bounce and run up from the pocket, we could expect our 1.618 to be @ $333 per share, pictured in the top right. MACD & RSI: Once again, If you just study the structure of the MACD underneath the two corrections, it is easy to see how close they are in form. I'm not going to attempt to explain each cross and describe what I am seeing in words, the charts speak for themselves for MACD. RSI during the previous correction saw a low highlighted in green at the bottom at 32. The previous two run ups both peaked at 82, and I would like to think it is highly likely RSI will bottom at 32 again, currently sitting at 39. This one it is also easy to see the similarities in structure on the chart. MACD and RSI showing the same structure as the last correction before a 300% run with a bottom going into earnings is possibly the most bullish copy and paste set up I have seen in a long time. Conclusion: I don't wish to spread more lackluster hopium for this stock. I am trying to make the point that structurally, if it were to bottom and reverse, within the next month would be the most logical place for this to occur. Hopefully, those that have been burned holding this stock understand that it simply just needed time to cool off after that 300% run. Once markets find the price has been pushed low enough it should begin another, it's literally illustrated in the charts. I could be wrong. There could be more downside after the golden pocket, but this is a play I am willing to lose money on because it meets every checkmark presented from an analysis view.

You're also probably tired of seeing hopium posts in the midst of tons of bear posts. I think most agree that fundamentally $AMD is a great company that should not be negative YTD. For those of you that have been waiting a long time to see it catch a bid off of the AI hype and necessity for chips, I think the wait is coming to an end. It's easy to point at the institutions and hedge funds and blame them for nuking the price, but hopefully with this thesis I can show that $AMD structurally is ready to reverse. To the untrained eye, the chart displayed should be easy to read, you can see the similarities between the two corrections quite easily. If any of you see any holes in this thesis please let me know. ""but institutional buying/selling, unusual options, market dominance,"" Yea IDGAF about all that, just let me know if there are holes in the technical analysis. If you don't want to read, I'll sum it up briefly: AMD will bottom at $114-$121, followed by an HTF extension to $330. Length of Corrections, Fibonacci Levels, Timing of Earnings & Structure: The first correction pictured lasted ~315 days, bottoming ~21 days from prior to earnings. The current correction is pacing to also finish within the golden pocket ($114-$122, where institutions have most interest in buying), matching the length of the previous correction and also ~21 days off of the next earnings. Earnings are marked in blue vertical lines on the chart. As you can see with our current correction, we are likely in the final wave of our ABCDE correction. There is a small chance we could skip the golden pocket and shoot for the 0.236 @ $96, but this is quite unlikely. The run up that followed the previous correction saw price top at $227, nearly touching our 1.618 extension at $232. If we see the same process unfold: A bounce and run up from the pocket, we could expect our 1.618 to be @ $333 per share, pictured in the top right. MACD & RSI: Once again, If you just study the structure of the MACD underneath the two corrections, it is easy to see how close they are in form. I'm not going to attempt to explain each cross and describe what I am seeing in words, the charts speak for themselves for MACD. RSI during the previous correction saw a low highlighted in green at the bottom at 32. The previous two run ups both peaked at 82, and I would like to think it is highly likely RSI will bottom at 32 again, currently sitting at 39. This one it is also easy to see the similarities in structure on the chart. MACD and RSI showing the same structure as the last correction before a 300% run with a bottom going into earnings is possibly the most bullish copy and paste set up I have seen in a long time. Conclusion: I don't wish to spread more lackluster hopium for this stock. I am trying to make the point that structurally, if it were to bottom and reverse, within the next month would be the most logical place for this to occur. Hopefully, those that have been burned holding this stock understand that it simply just needed time to cool off after that 300% run. Once markets find the price has been pushed low enough it should begin another, it's literally illustrated in the charts. I could be wrong. There could be more downside after the golden pocket, but this is a play I am willing to lose money on because it meets every checkmark presented from an analysis view. If it folds I cannot be upset because I stuck with the rules and didn't put money somewhere else that didn't look as structurally sound.","This cycle bottom is $115, calling it now...",0,0.505,NEGATIVE,1.0
