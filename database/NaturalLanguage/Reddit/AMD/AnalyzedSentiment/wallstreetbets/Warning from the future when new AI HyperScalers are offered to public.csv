Probably Nvidia prefers to sell its chips to CoreWeave, which is not trying to compete with its chips, rather than to Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, which are. By playing favorites here, Nvidia is trying to maintain a chokehold on the market. CoreWeave benefits because these big companies have to buy computing infrastructure from it.""",5,0.545,1.0,NEGATIVE
