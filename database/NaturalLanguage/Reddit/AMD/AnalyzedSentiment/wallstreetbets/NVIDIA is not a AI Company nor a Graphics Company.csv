So basically, NVIDIA can be seen as a very successful commercial research institute for developing high performance integrated circuits. I like the idea of comparing NVIDIA's number of publications to AMD's. By the way, the idea of quantifying a company's research effort and incorporating it into a company's valuation was popularized by Philip Fisher in his famous 1957 book ""Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits""...IBM also publishes a great deal of research on new chip technology. Also regularly in top journals like Nature... Still, I would rather bet on NVIDIA than IBM... :D",0,0.569,0.521,NEGATIVE
