,"Just over the past three trading days, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 indices have all recorded their largest three-day cumulative decline since June 2022! Last night, the Nasdaq plummeted by over 6% at one point, and the S&P 500 dropped by more than 4%, with both indices returning to their early May levels by the close of trading. Although the major U.S. indices and individual stocks still closed with significant losses, the intraday declines were somewhat moderated. The primary reason for this was the release of the U.S. July ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, which rebounded from a four-year low in June to 51.4, exceeding market expectations and returning to the expansion zone above 50! Sub-indices, including the New Orders Index and Employment Index, also showed growth. Notably, the Employment Index reached 51.1, marking the largest increase since September of last year and the first time this year that it has entered the expansion zone above 50. This data slightly alleviated fears from last week's significant non-farm payroll decline, making the market believe that the drop in new jobs was primarily due to Hurricane Barry hitting Texas. ðŸ‘‰ As discussed previously, the sharp decline in U.S. stocks at the start of August stemmed from worries about the U.S. economy falling into recession. Therefore, when the ISM Non-Manufacturing number showed growth yesterday, it somewhat restored market confidence in the economy, helping to narrow the intraday losses of U.S. stocks. The U.S. stock market now needs to see positive economic growth news to recover, unlike before when everyone was hoping for bad news, anticipating a Federal Reserve interest rate cut! Hence, it is crucial to continue monitoring other economic data. If strong and robust growth numbers do not consistently appear, investors will remain concerned about an economic recession, and the trend of selling stocks for cash will not end. The VIX Fear Index is a crucial indicator to observe market sentiment calming down.
