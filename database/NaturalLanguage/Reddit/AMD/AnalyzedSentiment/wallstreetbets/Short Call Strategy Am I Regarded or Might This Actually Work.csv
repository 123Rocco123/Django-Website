,"Okay, so I'm guessing a good amount of us in this subreddit were new to options trading at some point in time, and when we were just itty bitty option noobs first hearing about them, we just thought: "" Wow! this is just the same thing as betting on stocks but with leverage right?"" (might just be me when I first got into options trading but whatever). Moving on. I assume that many people's first instinct was to go and buy a call on a stock they were very bullish on. And I would assume that once we did that, we lost the entire position because we never knew how theta decay, IV, DTE, strike price, and other factors could sink your entire position. The thing about these factors is that when you buy a call, the majority of these factors are stacked against you, and if you don't want them to be completely stacked against you, you gotta pay up for a higher premium which is gonna yield the same or less of a return then the lower priced (but considerably more risky) options. You're paying for less risk. Long Calls are usually only profitable when the underlying has a significant enough uptick to outweigh all the other factors dragging down the value of the option. I'm sorry I don't mean to repeat the basics of valuing options but I think it's important to pretext them a little bit so my strategy makes more sense in the grand scheme of things. Okay, so my strategy is as follows: why buy a call, and have all of these factors stacked against you, when you can sell one, and have them work in your favor; I guess the whole basis is: the shittier the call, the better (meaning how likely it is to expire or be exercised with no value). The even better thing is we can magnify the shittiness to work in our favor on the sell side by selling balls deep out of the money calls, with low IV, and few DTE. And we can magnify this even further by selling calls on options with really shitty stocks underlying; stocks that are down 40% YTD, or just really, really stagnant not moving anywhere (might also get some sexy low IV to work in your favor there too). I don't really have any stocks in mind right now to lock this trade in off the top of my head, but $NOC and $AMD are quite down this last month and a half, and are relatively popular stocks. Like I said I need to find some better stocks for this Strat; these are not the ones I wanna go with, just what I thought of off the top of my head Now you might be saying two things: 1. ""The prices on them are probably gonna be pennies on the dollar. Sure the odds might be in your favor, but the yield is gonna be very low"", and 2. ""What fucking moron is gonna be stupid enough to buy these calls?"". To answer question 1: Why not just sell more calls? And to answer question 2: I don't think I need to illustrate the stupidity of individuals in the market, but if you need me to, here you go: WSB regards (not dissing, I am also a WSB regard who has lost thousands on YOLOs), teenagers with a Robinhood account that just found out about options, and maybe even people who are legit investors, but have bought the call as a part of some bigger options play, like a straddle, or iron condor (not to mention that in the example of the straddle, I don't think they would really give a shit if the call tanked because, well, it's a straddle lol, the put on the other side would cover the losses and make profit{and yeah there are probably more plays where this is the case that I am just forgetting about, but this is the example I'm just gonna go with for now}). Not to mention markets are huge and I've checked the open interest on some of these calls and there are hundreds going up to the thousands in open interest on balls deep OTM, 2DTE, Low IV call options. Anyways, I guess the reason I made this post is to double check with some options veteran (I've been into options for a little less than a year, but I have some knowledge on them from my job) to see if this strategy is complete delusional manic retardation, or if there is actually some substance to it. I wanna make sure there isn't some variable or factor I'm not accounting for that could tank this entire play. If anyone could let me know, that would be much appreciated, thanks.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE

The even better thing is we can magnify the shittiness to work in our favor on the sell side by selling balls deep out of the money calls, with low IV, and few DTE.

Like I said I need to find some better stocks for this Strat; these are not the ones I wanna go with, just what I thought of off the top of my head Now you might be saying two things: 1. ""The prices on them are probably gonna be pennies on the dollar. Sure the odds might be in your favor, but the yield is gonna be very low"", and 2. ""What fucking moron is gonna be stupid enough to buy these calls?"". To answer question 1: Why not just sell more calls? And to answer question 2: I don't think I need to illustrate the stupidity of individuals in the market, but if you need me to, here you go: WSB regards (not dissing, I am also a WSB regard who has lost thousands on YOLOs), teenagers with a Robinhood account that just found out about options, and maybe even people who are legit investors, but have bought the call as a part of some bigger options play, like a straddle, or iron condor (not to mention that in the example of the straddle, I don't think they would really give a shit if the call tanked because, well, it's a straddle lol, the put on the other side would cover the losses and make profit{and yeah there are probably more plays where this is the case that I am just forgetting about, but this is the example I'm just gonna go with for now}). Not to mention markets are huge and I've checked the open interest on some of these calls and there are hundreds going up to the thousands in open interest on balls deep OTM, 2DTE, Low IV call options. Anyways, I guess the reason I made this post is to double check with some options veteran (I've been into options for a little less than a year, but I have some knowledge on them from my job) to see if this strategy is complete delusional manic retardation, or if there is actually some substance to it. I wanna make sure there isn't some variable or factor I'm not accounting for that could tank this entire play. If anyone could let me know, that would be much appreciated, thanks.","I read like half of this but tell me if I'm wrong here. In The Big Short, wasn't that the two younger guys' investment strategy? Looking for markets that are down a lot YTD and then buying very cheap calls because the probability of them pulling back up was low. This way, the risk was low and they'd usually lose, but if they won, their returns were insane. Is this at all what you mean or am I regarded?",0,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Okay, so I'm guessing a good amount of us in this subreddit were new to options trading at some point in time, and when we were just itty bitty option noobs first hearing about them, we just thought: "" Wow! this is just the same thing as betting on stocks but with leverage right?"" (might just be me when I first got into options trading but whatever). Moving on. I assume that many people's first instinct was to go and buy a call on a stock they were very bullish on. And I would assume that once we did that, we lost the entire position because we never knew how theta decay, IV, DTE, strike price, and other factors could sink your entire position. The thing about these factors is that when you buy a call, the majority of these factors are stacked against you, and if you don't want them to be completely stacked against you, you gotta pay up for a higher premium which is gonna yield the same or less of a return then the lower priced (but considerably more risky) options. You're paying for less risk. Long Calls are usually only profitable when the underlying has a significant enough uptick to outweigh all the other factors dragging down the value of the option. I'm sorry I don't mean to repeat the basics of valuing options but I think it's important to pretext them a little bit so my strategy makes more sense in the grand scheme of things. Okay, so my strategy is as follows: why buy a call, and have all of these factors stacked against you, when you can sell one, and have them work in your favor; I guess the whole basis is: the shittier the call, the better (meaning how likely it is to expire or be exercised with no value). The even better thing is we can magnify the shittiness to work in our favor on the sell side by selling balls deep out of the money calls, with low IV, and few DTE. And we can magnify this even further by selling calls on options with really shitty stocks underlying; stocks that are down 40% YTD, or just really, really stagnant not moving anywhere (might also get some sexy low IV to work in your favor there too).
