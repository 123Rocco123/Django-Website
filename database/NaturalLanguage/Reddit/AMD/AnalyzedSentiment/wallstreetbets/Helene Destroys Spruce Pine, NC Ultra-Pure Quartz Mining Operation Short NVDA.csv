,"There is a location in North Carolina that produces essentially the global supply of ultra pure quartz. The quartz is needed for czochralski crucibles, don't ask me what that means, I don't know. These are essential for the production of basically every type of semiconductor. See this article: https://www.wired.com/story/book-excerpt-science-of-ultra-pure-silicon/ The company, Unimin (parent company - Sibelco) has it's main production facility in Spruce Pine, North Carolina. Rumors indicate that the town has been wiped off the face of the Earth. https://x.com/FossilLocator/status/1840218595541778791 Production has been hauled for the foreseeable future. There are some alternative methods to produce this material, but people are saying that this accounts for over 90% of the world's supply and this material is critical. The backup company in the US is The Quartz Company, which is also located in Spruce Pine, and is probably also gone too. I am trying to figure out who would be screwed the most from this. I'm sure it's a gamble, but some of the big semiconductor companies are going to be railed with no more supply of their fine powder. Thoughts on who to short? I'm thinking NVDA, TSM, AVGO, AMD, TXN, QCOM. Any other ideas? Edit: I'm looking at google maps and crossing with this image from twitter https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GYmBnGVWAAAjGsy?format=jpg&name=small That location is about 767m above sea level. Coordinates: 35°54'58""N 82°04'13""W. Flood looks like a meter or two. So lets say that everything below 768m flooded at some point in the last few days. Sibelco has their mine at 35°53'52""N 82°03'40""W, which is like 800m above sea level, so that's probably fine minus road damage from falling trees. Quartz Co has an operation on the river 35°55'37""N 82°05'36""W with a ton of equipment (presumably railroad shipping) that sits below 765m. Safe to say that area has been underwater.
