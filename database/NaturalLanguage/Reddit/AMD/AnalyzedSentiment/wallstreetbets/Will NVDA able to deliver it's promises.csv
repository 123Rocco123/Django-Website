Both companies are lining their data centers wall to wall with these GPUs and future models that don't exist yet out to 2027. People who continuously say that they don't need to refresh these annually don't understand that these cloud companies are still rapidly expanding and can't even build fast enough to sustain the orders of magnitude to the customer.,2,0.524,0.988,POSITIVE

And they should have a monster guidance because the data centers are all going to want the new chip with more effecency. The cost savings on a more effecient chip mean it's worth them retooling and buying more and more chips not only for power but pure energy savings. Also their thermal solution is going to be a huge deal for their racks. No one knows just how much upside they are going to give their guidance is the problem.. .but everyone sees them saying WE MADE A TON OF MONEY AND WERE GONNA MAKE EVEN MORE MONEY!

Yes it was more of consumer grade revolution but big companies also advanced from it as well. There already is, use cases for AI. My partner uses it almost everyday. I in hand only use it to further expand on or help simplify complex topics. This is only consumer side advancements mind you.Company/business demand is going to come from simple business tasks being delegated to it and expand from there. AI is capable of touching and advancing every aspect of normal human life and not just business.The bigger question is how long is it going to take to arrive to that state and how fast are we going to advance once chip demand and supply are in balance.The biggest current question, state of advancement, is what's being tackled right now.",4,0.557,0.989,POSITIVE

However, for any company running DCs and selling AI/compute/cloud services some percentage of their fleet must be top of the line as a selling point. And every year or so that line moves forward and they replace a portion of their older boxes with top of the line gear displacing the previous top of the line stuff they had. Rinse and repeat. And then there's straight up expansion to consider. Not saying NVIDIA is guaranteed infinite growth, but until we see a slow down in AI investment and overall cloud computing growth (cloud projected to be nearly 700B, 20% growth this year) they're basically printing money.",2,0.577,0.996,NEGATIVE

,"As Nvidia has moved from 2 year update cycles to 1 and it's competitors Intel and AMD are following 2yr update cycles, can Nvidia really deliver good year on year performance improvements? Any insider or with domain knowledge can give their opinion..","AI is kinda nebulous at the moment and hard to track exactly where the profit lines are, but look at the cloud boom. People all point to the AI bubble but it's really been the cloud services that boosted tech the last 10-15 years and forwards projections are around 20% growth for the next 5ish years. NVDA's growth has absolutely been front loaded and driven more by AI hype than cloud actual profits, but there's still some untapped upside here. Seriously, first to market with a true AI voice home assistant (Alexa, Siri, etc) is going to bank, once that point happens, when AI has made it all the way down to the consumer market and you can buy an AI enabled device at Walmart, that's the end of the hype train where things will settle down big time.",4,0.558,0.999,NEGATIVE

Unless they sell gpu instances which are entirely bought by AI startupsAnyways cloud is a different.story becaude it was useful from day1. It literally revolutionized how businesses host their services. To the point that any company with small to large server needs has 0 reason to keep their own data centers. That in multiple scopes - 1 economies of scale means overall cheaper for companies, 2. diverse availability zones means more reliable services yoi can deploy everywhere with 1 click. 3.

,"As Nvidia has moved from 2 year update cycles to 1 and it's competitors Intel and AMD are following 2yr update cycles, can Nvidia really deliver good year on year performance improvements?

More or less, in less than 5 years you will not be able to buy cloud compute without AI implemented in the back end (it already is in several areas to different degrees to help with real time resource optimization/allocation) and potentially a front end service package as well (chat bot, real time analytics, etc).
