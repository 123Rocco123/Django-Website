,,"The AI market has been priced for absolute perfection, but reality is setting in.Nvidia, AWS, Azure - all struggling with chip shortages. No chips, no AI. It‚Äôs that simple. And with the political instability, the supply chain is taking a massive hit.AI-applications are fully dependent on robust infrastructure. As companies cut costs and expensive Silicon Valley salaries, the innovation slows down. Less innovation, less reliability. The expected value of AI applications on a global scale is projected to reach $126 billion by 2025.Then theres AI-LLMs and Algorithms like OpenAI, Microsoft and IBM:Large language models need immense computing power. Microsoft and OpenAI rely on sophisticated hardware and seamless cloud integration. Disruptions in chip supply delay training and deployment, slowing down AI advancements. The expected value of AI-LLMs and algorithms is forecasted to hit $67 billion by 2025.These forecasts wont mean shit - Trump‚Äôs political moves have created a storm of uncertainty. With global tensions rising, the tech giants are facing massive disruptions. This isn‚Äôt just noise; it‚Äôs shaking the very foundations of the market",1,0.537,0.998,NEGATIVE

,,ASML lowered q3 forecast is a direct result of biden policies restricting sales to china. Hence their ~10% drop today. But it is in the interest of national security. Even though they already have hypersonic missiles that our navy can't do anything about.,4,0.534,0.996,NEGATIVE

,,"West Virginia is heavily dependent on the coal industry. If nuclear energy becomes the new norm, coal could be less in demand which would backfire on the political landscape.

,,"if oil booms people will bitch about paying more at the pump. for the last six years ‚Äî starting under Trump‚Äôs term and continuing to today ‚Äî the U.S. has annually produced ‚Äúmore crude oil than any country, ever (https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545#:~:text=Average%20annual%20production%20in%20Saudi,the%20United%20States%20that%20year.)However, U.S. refiners don‚Äôt have the capacity for all the lighter oil produced domestically and are always importing heavier crude from other countries. Domestic refineries, largely built before the U.S. fracking boom, are designed to process the heavier crude oil produced in Russia and the Middle East, while the light, sweet crude produced in the U.S. is often cheaper to export. (https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-biden-spar-over-us-energy-independence/)So i disagree on the oil gonna boom, even the Saudi's attempt to drive the price up by restricting output has largely failed. I think we need more refineries so I'm thinking Valero, Phillips, Marathon are ones to watch to capitalize on the never ending demand for energy. But all it takes is a new war and then Oil will certainly moon.",4,0.524,0.874,NEGATIVE

,,"In a Trump house, oil will do well as he will push fracking and anything else which will make us less dependent on foreign oil. This is what I will be doing leaps on.And that won‚Äôt cause an increase to solar as most of that is made in China and bet that isn‚Äôt going to happen.Here‚Äôs what I expect for finance in a Trump administration:Oil up (way up)Chinese tariffs (enough to be marginally painful) but not enough for Xi to want to kill the relationshipAnyone involved in Mexico border wall: up‚Ä¶ duhDefense companies: up (get ready for the ‚Äò6 nations against Israel‚Äô World Series. (Israel will bludgeon them faster than a hungry Alaskan hunting a harp seal)Consumer cyclicals: down to flat (price inflation will keep the poor poor‚Ä¶ just like under Biden so no diff there)Drug companies up (big pharmaceutical companies not R&D): no brainer thereBanking up‚Ä¶ seriously, you gotta ask?Automakers‚Ä¶ : mixed - F survives, but should have died the painful death it should have had in 2008, just like AIG and so many others. (You do realize your taxes are paying for all of that, right) ‚Ä¶ TSLA may make it an up 4 years IF they build a reliable car (that doesn‚Äôt look like a weird ‚Äòcousin It ‚Äò of a VW bug from 1960‚Äôs)‚Ä¶ not a fan.Foreign consumer goods will be up (especially if income / wage / wealth etc gap continues to widen)Manufacturing will also be up marginally ‚Ä¶ but only if Taiwan stays out of China‚Äôs crosshairs.Just opinion.
