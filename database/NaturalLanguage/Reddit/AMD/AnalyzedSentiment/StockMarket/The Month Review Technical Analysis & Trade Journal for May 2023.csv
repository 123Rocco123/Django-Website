,"OVERALL: Comparing the majors side-by-side show just how lopsided this 'rally' has been, with a clear breakout in QQQ, neutral consolidation in SPY, and clear bearish consolidation in IWM. If IWM is playing the role of leading indicator as it often does, then this could tilt probabilities to the downside as we enter the summer...but...the similarities between how QQQ consolidated & SPY is currently consolidating could indicate one final push higher for the broader market, before the larger macro bearish pattern plays out. Only time will tell, but what is equally clear is how much resistance is sitting on top of all three majors, due to the down-move they made over the course of 2022. SPY: Price continued to grind higher over the course of May, and is currently struggling to break out of the February 2022 double top. As a result, price remained in the mid-point of its upwards channel over the past month. If price action follows what the QQQ did when it consolidated in a similar fashion, then the August 2022 double top (431.73) and the channel ceiling are major resistance before any true break out can occur. Conversely, if this consolidation fails to move higher, then both upsloping channel floor TLs are major support. QQQ: The consolidation which occurred throughout April definitely played out in a big way throughout all of May. Price ripped out of the channel & through the August 2022 double top...and appears to be heading to a confluence of major resistance areas, namely the March 2022 gap fill at 361.10 to the March 2022 double top at 371.83. That August 2022 double top (334.42) and upsloping TL from channel price broke out of are now the major resistance levels for tech. Given how extended price is both from the October 2022 lows and since the May 2023 break out, as well as that confluence of resistance TLs, probabilities indicate at least consolidation...if not a bigger pullback to major support. IWM: While May saw decent swings up/down on a daily basis, overall the index continues to consolidate sideways in what is a clear bear flag off the down-move that occurred in March. The upsloping TL of the parallel channel floor is the major resistance line; whereas the October 2022 double bottom is the major support line. Before hitting those levels, price would need to break out of that bear flag, however, which puts immediate resistance & support at 179-180 & 171-170 respectively.

SPY was in a classic megaphone pattern. You have a tendency to over-parallel your lines. Parallels are the best structures to trade but only if they are accurate.It ended up not making a huge difference in SPY this round. But in the 1970s it mattered a lot. 1970s was all about the megaphone, for a decade.",0,0.51,0.924,NEGATIVE

Therefore, I added what a perfectly parallel TL would be on the bottom/lower end. I'd consider this ""extra"" TL to an interesting level to see if it plays out, but not one I'd trade. Regardless, the way orice has just been grinding higher in almost the exact center of the channel makes that ""extra"" TL a moot point for the time being, because neither the top nor the bottom of the channel has been tested in quite some time.Thanks for taking the time to comment -- I appreciate your perspective and critique. Hope you have a good weekend!",1,0.514,1.0,NEGATIVE
