Around 15 years ago, when I was in the college I used to study mnemonic web and all this stuff. I remember one of the coolest things by that time was akinator‚Ä¶it‚Äôs quite impressive where we are now, but there‚Äôs a lot more to come.

,"Am I getting into a sector that is going to see exponential growth, like the hype suggests, or is this just another tech bubble?","Im in the same boat and I got this advice from a friend recently. Investing heavily in one sector is dangerous for a few reasons, the most obvious one is that is could be a bubble that will pop at any time and you lose everything, or it isn‚Äôt a bubble and continues to grow exponentially but with that you likely have the scenario of a few certain stocks far outperforming the rest and with you being so far spread out, it somewhat makes it closer to a net zero in the end, with some stocks being exponential gains and others, losses.With that advice I‚Äôve chosen just to focus on the big players, IONQ, RGTI etc. Whether or not that will pay off, no body knows, just as likely a small player will have some breakthrough and end up dominating. I don‚Äôt see it being a bubble though. Guess we‚Äôll see üòÉ",0,0.52,NEGATIVE,0.998

It‚Äôs reasonable to aim for the best possible returns. However, we should seperate our risks because we‚Äôre not bigger than the market, and the future is uncertain.

They named their new CPUs ryzen xx ‚Äúai‚Äù but they don‚Äôt have anything special for AI that other CPUs are missing. Their GPUs are not ML friendly and they already threw in the towel there. AWS just announced that AMDs server ai processors are lacking any demand so they aren‚Äôt going to buy any right now.AI is GPU heavy and AMD gave up there.
