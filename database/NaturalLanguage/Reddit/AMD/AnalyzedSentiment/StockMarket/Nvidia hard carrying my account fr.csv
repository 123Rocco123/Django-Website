,,Why is everyone shitting on this portfolio. Yes it‚Äôs not diversified whatsoever. Hugely overweight on tech. Doesn‚Äôt have a huge portfolio not everyone is in the position too have the funds. At least there investing and they will learn as they go. Most people starting out nowadays look for quick money gamble 0DTE options with there whole account. At least this person has stock they believe in and bought in. Give guidance and help out. If you have criticism give it in a constructive way so they can learn. My advice is pick a couple stocks you believe in for the company but be dominant in VOO or VTI. Learn a lot more and read up on investing but certainly happy for you for willing to invest and trying to grow your money.,0,0.531,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"Everyone's pessimism with heavy tech portfolios in 21st century is what's keeping cheap buy ins for me. Loving it. Long ASML, NVDA, AMD.",1,0.558,0.997,POSITIVE
,,It‚Äôs not pessimistic at all. Im mostly tech stocks as well but the problem with this portfolio is that looks like they more recently jumped in judging off the profit maybe within the last month or so. I know personally tech is the reason why I‚Äôm doing so good this year but also when shit hits the fan not being diversified and heavy in tech will leave you wrecked. When one tech stocks fall most others follow it‚Äôs all good in a bull market to be overweight when the drop comes you do not want to have all your eggs on one basket,2,0.549,0.999,NEGATIVE

,,I don't know why anyone would doubt tech. Heavy Tech may bring you on a ride but tech and healthcare have the biggest growth potential. Literally tech has been holding this market together the past couple months. But to each is own. I've got amazing gains from heavy tech. It's all about the entry price and length of holding.,1,0.543,0.999,POSITIVE
,,I don‚Äôt think anyone doubts tech. It‚Äôs about the timing of tech. My portfolio has been heavy tech for the last year. But when I see someone buy in heavy tech after tech has been running insane the last year I would give advice to diversify especially when just starting out. I literally said tech is the reason why I‚Äôm doing so good the last year. But I‚Äôve been investing long enough to know you have to diversify especially after seeing tech grow like we did over the last year. Knowing when to sell and take profit and rebalance your portfolio is even more important as an investor. So you don‚Äôt get taken for the ride down.,2,0.583,0.873,POSITIVE
,,I agree but diversity is for sustainment and protection. Until you build a large portfolio I wouldn't diversify much. I say that from personal experience. Tech literally is what has kept the market from tanking and if everyone listened to what I said they be up over 30% since this post. I'd just diversify with one or 2 ETFs.,3,0.553,0.997,NEGATIVE
,,Yea no I understand trust me my portfolio is heavy tech too my 401k is heavy tech for the most part tho in ETFs since I‚Äôm young. I agree until you have a sizable portfolio you really don‚Äôt have to be that diversified. Until there is a drop in the market or maybe a black swan event then we would be kicking our self. But no matter what I think tech moves the best and will continue to move the best far into the future.,4,0.526,0.657,NEGATIVE
,,Not everyone on here would say my portfolio was good 6 months ago since I was heavy in crypto tech and I would have prob got blasted for that on here. Since then some of those crypto Based stocks I hold are up 60-150 %,5,0.536,0.966,POSITIVE

,,That account is about $17K including cash. A few of those are tracer shares too. AAPL makes up 40% of total holdings and the bank stocks are roughly 19% combined. I'm fiine with that much AAPL because it acts like a good balance since it increases in value and isn't very volatile. I'm 22 years old and am wondering if i should be more into aggressive growth stocks like TSLA or NVDA. I'm very new to investing and would appreciate any feedback.,3,0.566,0.926,NEGATIVE
