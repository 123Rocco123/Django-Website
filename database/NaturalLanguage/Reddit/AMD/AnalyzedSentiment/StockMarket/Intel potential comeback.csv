,"Hey! Intel seems like a company that's really struggling right now. Their stock just dropped to around $20.16, and it’s not just the GPU market giving them trouble. They’re battling issues on multiple fronts. First off, their foundry business (where they manufacture chips) is bleeding money – about $7 billion in annual losses! They’re not expected to break even there until at least 2027. On top of that, they’re losing market share to AMD and Nvidia, both in CPUs and GPUs. Nvidia is dominating with AI, and AMD is taking more and more of the gaming market. It also feels like they completely missed the whole AI boom. Nvidia is raking in insane profits, while Intel seems to be… just watching? And to make things worse, their CEO recently stepped down, which makes their future even more uncertain. That said, they’ve just launched their new Arc B580 and B570 budget GPUs. Nvidia and AMD seem more focused on AI and data centers right now, so maybe Intel has a shot at carving out a space in gaming? But is that really enough to turn things around? What do you guys think? Is this a buy opportunity now that the stock is so low, or is Intel too far gone to bounce back? Would love to hear your thoughts!",US will not let intel sink.,0,0.546,POSITIVE,0.973

,"Hey! Intel seems like a company that's really struggling right now. Their stock just dropped to around $20.16, and it’s not just the GPU market giving them trouble. They’re battling issues on multiple fronts. First off, their foundry business (where they manufacture chips) is bleeding money – about $7 billion in annual losses! They’re not expected to break even there until at least 2027. On top of that, they’re losing market share to AMD and Nvidia, both in CPUs and GPUs. Nvidia is dominating with AI, and AMD is taking more and more of the gaming market. It also feels like they completely missed the whole AI boom.

Would love to hear your thoughts!","The new chip is an experimental one not meant to ever reach the market - more a working prototype - that has to be operated in a machine that largely does not yet exist. Their achievement is incredible, but it is still many years from being something GOOGL is using or selling and many more years before quantum chips land in consumers' hands.Don't buy a company's stock because it had a breakthrough that might make it a leader in the new technology in 5 - 10 years when it just starts getting commercialized. It won't materially affect that share price for years. If it isn't having an impact on EPS next quarter, or on revenue guidance for next year, then it has little to offer retail investors right now.If you're bullish on quantum computing and quantum chips for the long-term - and you should be - then GOOGL may be a great buy for that reason around 2030 - 2035.",1,0.573,NEGATIVE,0.914
