,"Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities. This is a daily watchlist for trading. I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you’re on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly. I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on _____? will be ignored unless you add detail to the question” News: NYCB shares jump after new CEO gives two-year plan for ‘clear path to profitability’ NYCB- News above. Most interesting thing I’m watching today. MSOS/TLRY/MJ/WEED- (US) Senate Majority Leader Schumer reintroduces cannabis reform legislation AMD- Reported beat on earnings and revenue (0.62 vs 0.60 exp). Despite sales that were slightly ahead of expectations, stock drops on in-line forecasts. PINS- Reported beat on earnings of 0.20 vs 0.14 exp, revenue of 740M vs 700M exp. Spoke about profitability and investing in AI. SBUX- Reports Q2 0.68 vs 0.79 expected, revenue of 8.56B vs 9.14B exp. Pretty big miss on earnings, looking into this for a swing trade. Longer-term watches: NVDA/SMCI, SNOW (long for small position), BA, ULTA, TSLA, META","And obviously, the fed decision today- expected for rates to not change.",0,0.541,0.984,NEGATIVE
