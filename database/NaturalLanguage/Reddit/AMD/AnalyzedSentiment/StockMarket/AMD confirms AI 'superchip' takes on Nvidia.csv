,,"There is a meta game to the stock market. To the general public‚Äôs credit, they have become better investors by and large compared to ten or twenty years ago.But bubbles happen for a reason: hope.The vast majority of the time bubbles are absurd from Tulips hundreds of years ago to SPACs a couple years ago.But once in a great while, all the big hopes don‚Äôt just materialize but they materialize in a bigger way than even the bubble could have predicted.This is it.

I have a tesla with FSD and let me tell you, they aren't anywhere near robotaxis. That doesn't stop investors from touting that as being worth nearly 100% growth in a few month.the market has lost it's mind right now.And let me also say... even if you are right and AI is on the verge of changing humanity... when the first person gets killed by AI it will all come to a crashing halt for at least a few years.",2,0.552,1.0,NEGATIVE
