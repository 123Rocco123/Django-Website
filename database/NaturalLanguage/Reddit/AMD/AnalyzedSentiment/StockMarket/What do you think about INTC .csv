,"Hello everyone, intel has cut its dividend by 66% and this is very bad news in the short term, but can this be good news in the long term? the company will be able to better distribute its profits for research and development I think? can intel come back into the race against its competitors? Or do you think that the company has fallen too far behind and that it will be difficult to return to the level of its competitors who are growing rapidly? I think that Intel steel better than AMD for gaming and professional use case i want to have your opinion please. thanks in advance!","I decided to DCA from here but it's probably too earlyIt's not a bad idea to wait and see if there's hope for INTC, even if the stock becomes more pricey before you buy in.Go on r/Intel to see how their fanboys feel. To me, even they seem a little doom and gloomPersonally, I think they won't ever catch up to their competition like NVDA & AMD for GPU and CPU designs. And they can't manufacturer like $TSMBut the company still looks fairly cheap. And I think cutting their divi was a wise choice, but they should have cut the whole thing.They are trying to do too much. Design cheap and expensive chips. Manufacturer cheap and expensive chips. They have no real niche; and on top of all this, they go through hoops and ladders to pay a dividendThere could potentially be a bigger selloff once the dividend ETFs, investors, and funds sell their INTC holdings in favor of 4-5% bonds and CDs",0,0.531,1.0,NEGATIVE

And Intel has one generation for GPUs.That being said Im not buying for a while,1,0.563,1.0,NEGATIVE

They are entrenched in military and their critical industries that they will not let them die. They just need a better leader in my opinion focused .on manufacturing efficiency and high level of first pass quality. If it hits $20, I will be a buyer.",0,0.535,0.995,NEGATIVE

But TXN has a solid and stable divi. INTC obviously does not . So it'll be tricky for them to attract optimistic investors. Because their growth prospects suck too.I don't ever think it'll trade on par with NVDA or AMD's multiples againEven a fabless like QCOM looks more valuable than INTC . Similar multiples but overall a much more competitive and respectable company",0,0.54,0.995,NEGATIVE

Intel seemed very successful when it was in such an environment as well.Apple is at least a couple of years if not more ahead of QCOM they just don't sell their chips to third parties...,1,0.53,0.998,NEGATIVE
