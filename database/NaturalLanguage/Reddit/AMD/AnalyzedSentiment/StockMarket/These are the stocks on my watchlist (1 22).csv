,"No positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers) To clarify since I've been asked: I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel: they're just my perspective of where a stock could potentially go. Percentages signify what the stock is trading at when I write up the report and are NOT predictions of stock price EOD. Some of the stocks I post are <$500M market cap and are NOT good long-term investments, but are good candidates to day trade. JBLU/SAVE, liquidity 9/10- SAVE rose to $7.70 today, likely due to JBLU saying they will appeal the decision. I personally am not a long-term holder in this, if JBLU really succeeds in appealing this is a process that will likely takes months. RVSN, liquidity, 8/10- Mainline System received certification for EU Railway Standards SEDG- liquidity, 7/10- Announces a restructuring plan with 15% workforce reduction NVDA, liquidity 8/10- Broke $600- but not cleanly. Still short the stock, but since the $600 broke so uncleanly I won’t be adding to my position. AMD/TSM/Semis/etc. – Moving opposite to NVDA- this could be the day they diverge, and NVDA could crack soon after (wild conjecture). Worth watching. Standing tickers TSLA, liquidity 7/10- Worth watching with Elon Musk fighting for 25% ownership of the company. RIOT/MARA/COIN/BITO/IBIT/HOOD/GBTC – Outflows are confirmed to get larger (possibly larger whales taking advantage of the additional liquidity. JNPR, liquidity 9/10 – HPE confirmed to buy JNPR at $40/cash, just leaving this on here for people to be aware, or if you want to play the merger arb. NS- to be acquired by Sunoco for $7B in stock. M- rejects $5.8B cash bid, saying it is not good enough (21/sh). Could see this go higher from a rival bidder","What does everyone think about Titan Machinery?? With all the changes in leadership, the European markets, integrating a significant number of new stores in Australia (& NA), what does everyone think of Titan? Personally, I am still a little frustrated at their ability to meet earnings expectations consistently - fool me once, but twice in the last three quarters? Hopefully the new leadership can sort that out. The part that worries me is they are blaming the misses on lack of supply, yet their inventories continue to climb? Curious to get the pulse out there.....",0,0.54,0.962,NEGATIVE
