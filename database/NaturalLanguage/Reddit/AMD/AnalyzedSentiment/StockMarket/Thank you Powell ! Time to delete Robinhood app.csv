,,"It really is, even though the fed is the master manipulator of global markets. To be honest they really don't need to push for a 2% inflation rate because in doing so they will break the economy. 3 to 3.5 or even 4% is tolerable. For one the Fed can't end the war in the Ukrainian which is just one of the main catalysts for what the US Economy is dealing with. With that, add in residential home shortages m, because investors are buying up everything to the where demand out paces supply which drives up prices for owing or resnting, followed by fake shortages to even build a new home, then add up all the PPP loans and Stimulus Covid Funding for business and families, then add up all the jobs that were lost during that time which lead to supply chain bottlenecks, along with all the industries who either wanted or demanded pay raises which push costs up, followed by labor shortages.Yes, 4% Inflation I can deal with.",1,0.532,0.521,NEGATIVE

Inexperienced retail traders bite the hand that feeds. Bear in mind that we can all thank these absurdly low interest rates and quantitative easing from the Fed as a reason crypto and the stock market exploded after March of 2020 in the first place.
