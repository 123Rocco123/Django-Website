I open my puter and say pew pew pew and try to buy it as low as I can while I sit there.Disney I like to buy in multiples of five. You know how you can get it to show all your stock buys, My goal was to get Disney to fill up the screen with how many times I bought it.So a few weeks ago, I would count back like 5 and 7 buys ago and sale them. Take the funds after they settle and rebuy Disney. Yesterday I realized I had the same amount of shares as I did when I started doing that. BUT I have them for 3500 cheeper. I didn't even know you could do that. I always sold them in the green but lots of times just for a few shekels over.Win or lose its all ok, I did more than try, I was involved with my future me.",1,0.531,0.977,NEGATIVE
