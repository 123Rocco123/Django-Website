I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones.

","That’s what I thought, thanks for your input :) I have a good chunk of my portfolio as NVDA and not selling anytime soon. The reason I asked is that I’ve been waiting to buy more and was hoping the stocks to dip a little this week and buy at a lower price, but I guess it doesn’t even matter in the long run and I should just focus on DCA.

","It is a peculiar time for them to raise money since they don’t need money. They have two Billy cash in hand, zero debt, and positive cash flow. The reasons for raising that kind of cash are all subject to heavy speculation ie. acquisitions. No telling, but the fact remains that they didn’t need the money.

","I think the simplest explanation applies here- GME was trading at $11 at the beginning of May. When they announced the share offering it was trading closer to $50.If you had the opportunity to sell stock at 5x what it was trading at a month ago (with the opportunity to buy back at a lower price later) then you'd probably do it.Even if they didn't need the money, it just signals they'd rather have $50 in cash than a share at GME at that moment.
