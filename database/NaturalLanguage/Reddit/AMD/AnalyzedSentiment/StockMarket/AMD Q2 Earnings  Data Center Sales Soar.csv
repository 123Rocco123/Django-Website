That can't be said for AMD. Also the support on all the libraries is second - everyone supports Nvidia first. Then when it comes to virtualizing the hardware, reusing it across multiple machines - Nvidia leads (due to mature kubernetes libraries) and I believe AMD is just starting to catch up on that side.The numbers prove all this - but I personally would love to see more investment in the lifelong support. I mentioned some of that here - https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1akel4h/amd_cto_is_here/ - and there is a lot of good context in that thread about the differences and where amd might still be lagging.",0,0.553,0.544,NEGATIVE
