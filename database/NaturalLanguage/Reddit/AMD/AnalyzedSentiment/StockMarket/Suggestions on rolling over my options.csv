,,"Pay attention to the whole market. Transports were signaling a sell-off early.Everybody is in the same names. Diversify.If you looked at Financials, energy, or transports, they all pointed to exhaustion.Well what does this mean? The 0dte call junkies won't have enough volatility to make profit on calls. What happens when you cut your red calls? It acts like fuel to the downside.When the whole market looks healthy, the whole market is healthy. When it's a tale of two markets, you need to be savvy.People trade SPY like is SMH. They don't realize that when they sell their underwater calls, they drag everything down.Right now, XLF and XOM look like they want to keep dying. XOM looks like it wants to visit the 200 moving average.Not financial advice, but if you buy puts tomorrow, it's after a fat red candle. If you aren't a veteran bear, you will be scared to buy puts. Maybe buy one and then scale safely. Set SL in green. Slowly navigate the down market.Many minor corrections have multiple red days, but those days always have dip buyers that make it look like it's over. Scary I know.If IYT has a full candle close below the 200 tomorrow, I fully expect a bounce and retest. If it fails the retest, I have to stay in a bear bias. I have no choice. If it bounces off the 200 in a bullish way for a couple of days, I can remove my bias.",6,0.521,1.0,NEGATIVE
