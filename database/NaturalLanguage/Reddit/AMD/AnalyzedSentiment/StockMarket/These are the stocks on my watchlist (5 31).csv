,"Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities. This is a daily watchlist for trading. I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you’re on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly. I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on _____? will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. News: Fed’s Favored Inflation Gauge Cools, Spending Unexpectedly Drops   You know what the news is on this one. Worth watching for volatility. NVDA- Yesterday’s news: US is slowing AI Chip Exports to Middle Easy by NVDA and AMD. Still short-biased on this, still holding short from yesterday.   ASTS- Announced partnership with VZ for full coverage of the US 2 days ago. Still puttering around $9, still worth watching to see if we break $10.     MDB- Overall, management lowers 2025 forecast, YoY revenue growth slows for 3****rd consecutive quarter, and only called for 12% growth for the entire year. SMMT- Crazy mid-day catalyst yesterday, lung-cancer treatment is a possible contender with MRK’s blockbuster. Worth watching for continued movement today.   DELL- Stock falls despite Q1 earnings and revenue beat. 22.24B in revenue vs 21.62e, EPS of 1.27 vs 1.23e. However, they reported AI servers are sold at “near-zero” margins.
