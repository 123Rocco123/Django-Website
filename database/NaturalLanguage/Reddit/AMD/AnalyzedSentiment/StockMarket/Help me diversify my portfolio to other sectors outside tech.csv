,,Why not just invest in an index like SPY that is tech heavy? I respectfully doubt you will outperform the SPY in the long term.,0,0.533,0.996,NEGATIVE
,,Good point. So you'd rather focus on index and be happy with the quite average but solid return?,1,0.528,0.858,NEGATIVE
,,"Me personally, yes. Disclaimer of this is not financial advice blah blah but you can google the returns of a whatever hedge fund or well known investor and you will find that IF they outperform the market it is only for a limited time (few years usually). I do not mean to say you personally could not outperform the market for a year or 10 years or whatever but if you can do that consistently you would be the very small exception to the rule.",2,0.547,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"Solid arguments for sure, also feels like the easiest option. No thinking, just chuck the money into that fund kind of.",3,0.524,0.873,NEGATIVE
,,Yes exactly. I’m an internet stranger so for sure don’t just take my word but investing for solid returns is a bit of a grind and shouldn’t be overly complicated.https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/04/21/why-long-term-investors-have-a-leg-up-on-hedge-fun/Quick google search to express my point.,4,0.514,0.843,NEGATIVE
,,"Oh also, if your brokerage lets you look at your returns compared to an index of the same time frame, S&P 500 is obviously the gold standard.",2,0.532,0.917,POSITIVE
,,"What about some people who is close with the matter, such as mr Warren? He was not a lot in diversif. at the beginning of his career, as far as I know",3,0.505,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,Warren Buffet is a great example of the exception. There are likely millions of investors who modeled themselves after Warren and you have no idea who they are because they didn’t make it. Again not an impossible thing to do but every kid playing football is not likely to be an NFL star.,4,0.506,0.999,NEGATIVE
,,Does the SPY pay you directly a dividend by holding that ETF?,1,0.512,0.993,NEGATIVE
,,SPY pays out 1.6% dividend quarterly. My personal strategy does not include a focus on dividends but I wouldn’t own SPY if the goal was high dividend pay outs.,2,0.524,0.895,NEGATIVE
,,Step 1) Buy stock in non-tech sectors,0,0.616,0.893,POSITIVE
,,Thanks... That is technically a very correct answer. What would you buy?,1,0.543,0.974,POSITIVE
,,"If you are building a solid diversified portfolio in equities only, you should own some income stocks as well. Their dividends give you exposure to payments similar to holding a bond that pays a coupon payment on certain dates until maturity. An income stock does not have the direct current market value if you need to sell in reverse (negative correlation) to interest rate movements/levels.The 60/40 equity/bond build is back in favor since the QE mania from The Fed has ended which only goosed up the equity returns over the past 13 years. A 2-year treasury bond gives you a 4.8% yield right now until maturity, with zero risk.The Rule of thumb is the older you get, and having less working/income earnings years left until retirement, the heavier you weigh on the bond side. Bonds have much less risk, especially Treasuries.One portfolio I built had tech (MSFT - small dividend), banks (JP morgan - smal dividend), retail (DLTR - retail), defense (LMT - small dividend), energy (XOM - 8% dividend) and consumer products (MO - 8% dividend) in the mix. Built that one in the fall of 2020 and has worked quite well. (those 8%s were at time of buying. XOMs is lower now).Well diversified. Your portfolio gets an income payment every quarter from dividends with which you can use to reinvest and buy a few more shares of the stock. Some stocks went up, some went down. Overall, the SP500 is down, and that portfolio is up.Here is one of the better links I found on sector rotation.https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_analysis:sector_rotation_analysisNotice the 6 stocks I put in that portfolio fall in different sectors on the rotation map, which further diversifies your portfolio and also against market fluctuations. To size balance to start, you can use $s into each stock and not the nominal stock prices.That portfolio got a little lucky as I picked DLTR in the fall of 2020 after the March covid blip down and then popped back up as I expected coming inflation with The Fed buying over $4T in bonds. Then, after Joe won, I figured DC spending was going to ramp up. It did not hurt that the war propped up LMT and energy prices as well.Best of luck.going forward long term, I really like cyber security stocks.",0,0.536,0.578,NEGATIVE
,,Thanks for an insightful comment! Definitely some interesting opinions here that I'll consider!,1,0.506,0.995,POSITIVE
,,"Just my opinion and not financial advice.Apple, Alphabet, NVDA, AMD, and Tesla are 57-58%Palantir, Coinbase, and Roblox is your high risk stuff 8%I would Use your 10% cash to add to SCHD which are high dividend stocks that hedge against bear markets like 2022. Some of the stocks in SCHD include Costco, Pepsi, Merck, Amgen, Cisco, Blackrock. Then you got 4% in WMT already.So then your portfolio becomes 57% tech, 20% s&p500, 15% SCHD and WMT, 8% high risk stuffYes out of cash but then either sell the high risk stuff that hasn’t worked or id chop some apple or Google",0,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,I have some cash outside this account that I could continue to invest as well. About 30% of the total portfolio size. Would you go with a similar split between sectors if those were invested or continue increase diversity in e.g. SCHD?,1,0.543,0.607,NEGATIVE
