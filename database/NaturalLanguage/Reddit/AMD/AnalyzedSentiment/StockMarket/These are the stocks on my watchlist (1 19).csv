,"No positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers) To clarify since I've been asked: I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel: they're just my perspective of where a stock could potentially go. Percentages signify what the stock is trading at when I write up the report and are NOT predictions of stock price EOD. Some of the stocks I post are <$500M market cap and are NOT good long-term investments, but are good candidates to day trade. NVDA, liquidity 8/10- Broke all times highs AGAIN- 575, 550, and 600 levels worth watching. This thing is a steam train and $600 is the major level that will make or break this stock (if we ever reach it). Not worth playing otherwise IMO. MESA, liquidity 8/10- Enters agreement with UAL to improve operating and financing terms, very low market cap (<$50M) but pretty liquid. Worth watching to see if we break $1.25 ceiling. AMD/TSM/Semis/etc. – Entire sector has been hot, SAVE, liquidity 9/10- SAVE gained 25% today- it’s appealing with JBLU to appeal merger block, and reported Q4 prelim revenue. IRBT- EU Commission regulators will likely block Amazon’s acquisition of IRBT, down 34% on this news. Stocks Worth Watching (on a longer timeframe) TSLA, liquidity 7/10- Worth watching with Elon Musk fighting for 25% ownership of the company. RIOT/MARA/COIN/BITO/IBIT/HOOD/GBTC - Worth watching proxies off the open for order flow moves (will remove this when moves no longer get larger). JNPR, liquidity 9/10 – HPE confirmed to buy JNPR at $40/cash, just leaving this on here for people to be aware, or if you want to play the merger arb.",I picked up 815 shares of PFE at $28 this morning. Historic low number translates to a 6% yield. CEO is willing to put his salary on the line in a bet the stock price is bottoming.,0,0.543,0.998,NEGATIVE

Sacred cow, that will not change. Number 2 priority, it is to delever. We are going to pay back a lot of this debt in the next 1 and 2 years. Number 3 priority, it is to allocate after we do those 2 things, the business between growing the business and buying back shares. And of course, the first periods of my tenure was always we didn't buy back shares, was investing in the business. This is what needed to be done so that we can cover the gap of the LOEs. Now we have done it, and we are moving. So in essence, you should expect 2024, after all the changes in the setup that we did in year '23, to be a year of execution",2,0.548,0.802,POSITIVE
