,,"Nah... I think we will be range bound/sideways from here for a while. I doubt we make new lows unless unemployment starts rising. We won't make new highs until the macroeconomic situations improve (inflation subsiding, FED cutting, economy growing at a higher rate). This will probably a long way off though.The recent market catalysts have not been as bad a feared. Markets priced in worse. Many of the speculative bubble stocks and tech have basically crashed. You look at some of these charts and all the 2020-2022 gains are gone. Now there are fair buying opportunities in a lot of these beaten down names and money has been rotating into them.Catalysts: Small FED rate hikes Slowing but not contracting economy Slowing inflation Low unemployment Earnings falling but not as much as feared. Bond market still pricing in rate pauses and cuts in the medium term 12-24 months.",0,0.533,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,Stock market goes up = inflationary and works against tightening financial conditions. I think JPow must be pissed by now that bulls still don‚Äôt understand the concept of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fight the FED‚Äù.

,,Genuine question: how does an increasing stock market result in more inflation? My intuition is that more people buying stocks is locking cash up from being spent in the economy. Is it because of dividends?,1,0.55,0.689,POSITIVE
,,Because of the wealth effect. If people are doing well in the markets it makes them feel rich and therefore are more inclined to go out and spend more money.,2,0.523,0.704,NEGATIVE

,,The fed doesn‚Äôt care about stock prices,1,0.583,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"That is where you are wrong. They do care. as it works against them in their goal to tighten financial conditions. Have you ever heard of the wealth effect? In this case, if you feel poor because your returns are negative in the markets you are inclined to spend less, and by you spending less contributes to tightening financial conditions.",2,0.509,0.969,POSITIVE
,,"Yeah, the wealth effect. I'm sure that theory has been rigorously proved by evidence, right? Just like the Fed has always been totally able to control inflation through interest rate policy...Paul Krugman called it the dirty secret of monetary policy that interest rate changes don't have much effect on business lending. The only channel is asset inflation, and if you accept that, and still wish to come to the conclusion that monetary policy is effective and relevant, then the ""wealth effect"" becomes necessary to justify that conclusion. It is more palatable to mainstream economists than flat out admitting that the Fed doesn't have the tools to do its supposed job - although the Fed in recent decades has been owning up to this more.",3,0.517,0.79,NEGATIVE
,,Except people‚Äôs asset prices contribute a lot less to the wealth effect than people‚Äôs equity in their homes.,3,0.502,0.716,NEGATIVE
