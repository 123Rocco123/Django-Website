You don’t want this sub as it is for investing, you do trading in Ponzi schemes that operate on the “greater fool” theory.You bought AMC which is a horrible company run by unethical management in a dying business that is stealing what little wealth there is from shareholders.You bought Tesla which is a horrible company run by unethical management in a dying business that is stealing what little wealth there is from shareholders.You bought DJT which is a horrible company run by unethical management in a dying business that is stealing what little wealth there is from shareholders.AMC management does new share issues every time the stock starts to go up then pays itself massive stock option bonuses to funnel all the wealth away from you and into their pockets.Tesla management recently tried to steal $55 billion in a pay package for one single employee during a time of declining business and then when that was going to get blocked threatened to steal the company’s IP and take it to a competitor, stealing it away from the shareholders who paid for it.DJT management has already bankrupted a previous company THAT HAD THE EXACT SAME TICKER symbol by paying one employee massive bonuses, stock option grants and salary increases at the same time the company spiraled down into bankruptcy leaving the manager walking away with all the money while all the shareholders got left holding the bag. On top of that, in the investing world when you pay 10 times sales you are starting to get ridiculous by paying WAY too much for a company, because no matter how fast it is growing 10x sales is a ridiculous price. Here you are paying over 600 times sales for a dying business that has fewer users than MySpace.These are not investments. These are all Ponzi schemes. There is not a single person alive who can give you advice on how to invest in a Ponzi scheme because at some point everything turns back to pumpkins and mice and nobody knows when that will be. There are no clocks on the wall.I’m not saying this to be mean, but you either need to sell these stocks or you need to go over to WSB and admit you’re a meme trader playing musical chairs trying to guess when the music is going to stop.
