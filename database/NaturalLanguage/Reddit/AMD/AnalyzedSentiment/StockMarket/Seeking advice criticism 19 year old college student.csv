I’d get rid of all of these positions if I were you, or at least liquidate 12k and leave 2k for the risky bets if you’re that guy. There’s no reason why you have so much saved up and just gamble it all in stocks. Liquidate and invest in the total stock market index, either VTI or VOO and never sell. Leave maybe 2k for a little bit of individual tech stocks and maybe some crypto. My personal investments are divided between VTI, VGT and another ETF that tracks construction companies. I’m 22 and i’ve been pretty conservative by just playing it safe in the market. You can make and invest money safely while you learn. When you feel you’re ready to time the market (which most of the time does not work unless you’re Warren Buffet or Jim Simons), then it would be better to try and make your own individual investments. Otherwise bro, stick to riding the market and collect the compound interest until you know a lot",4,0.531,1.0,NEGATIVE

What happens is a lot is people are afraid to lose money on a stock so they wait to sell for it to potentially go back up cause losing money a trade sucks. But you’re better off selling at loss taking the loss off your taxes and putting the rest of your money into a stock with a better future.

You should be proud that you have that much money and your willingness to invest now will 1000% payoff in the future. Good on you dude.As for your picks. I would HIGHLY suggest doing some research into “market sectors” and checking out securities that interest you. Do some research on how to value them (I.e. look at their earnings, check their quarterly results, stuff like that) and spread some of that risk around. As of now, you are pretty exposed to market fluctuations concerning tech. To avoid this you have to diversify and look at a couple things outside of “what’s hot” on whatever investment news you’ve been checking. I know a lot of people will tell you otherwise since you’re so young but look into index funds too. They still have risk but they essentially diversify your investment themselves and can provide pretty decent returns over time. Also, don’t be afraid of international markets.",0,0.533,0.505,POSITIVE

It’s very easy to make money in a bull market and feel like you know what you are doing - and then lose it all.Buy great companies and hold them. You have some (Nvda, Amd).

I went from 29 to just over 36 (was at 37, but bad day for one of my plays). I’ve sold off my original positions, but still have some of them off and on. Advice: with those gains, play how you want to. Manage risk and don’t play options/riskier plays, unless you play with your profits.

Not saying you necessarily are wrong but it’s a lot of risk to pile in a very hyped basket so I hope you have done your homework and believe in your case. Assuming you do not do your own assessments/valuations I’d suggest you shorten the chips stack and move the money into VOO, maybe keep 80% VOO and 20% in individual stock while you develop a stock valuation/picking methodology.

Also take a look at MU, I would not buy right now, but it tends to cycle between about $50 to $100. So I’ve been buying when it drops to around $50. Soxx contains both AMD and NVDA so maybe you want to cash some profits from amd and nvda (unless you think they’re gonna keep going up). You might also want to add some “safe” stocks, take a look at the holdings in Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA or BRKB), it’s mostly boring stuff but many pay dividends and if you set it to reinvest the dividends they will grow over time.",0,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE
