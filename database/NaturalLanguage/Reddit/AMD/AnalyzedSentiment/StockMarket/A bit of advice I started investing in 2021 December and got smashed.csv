,"I am just looking for a bit of advice if it seems to be a good investing strategy, I am down 20% with the recent acquisition of BRK.B and Microsoft, but I have been in -40% most part of the year. I am still optimistic with the long term run of my shares and I am actually believe in them. The total value of the portfolio is around 40.000 euros and I still hold cash (around 120K euros). Saving around 4000 euros per month and still a job contract for the next 2 years, would you be a bit more aggressive?.

I held off investing in late 2021 and early 2022 as I was watching a lot and reading a lot. Plus most of my DD has been in tech sector so I was seeing what was happening in qtly reports/recruiting etc. I only jumped back in sept 22. Did an initial lump sum investment as I wasnt too worried about any short term downs and infact was looking forward to some dips as things rallied. Since it would allow me to buy low (in that moment) to keep adding or diversifying. I dont look at how much I am down (or up) in my overall portfolio since its too short a time period and I am looking to buy and hold.To OP, personally I am being aggressive or atleast that was the plan but if I understood your point accurately then if I were you I wouldnt put my 4k monthly towards investing alone. Assuming you have emergency funds, then in that case Maybe use a 1000 and put rest in HYSA (for US atleast) and stash cash. So when in a few months I want to do a LSI to pick something I have been wanting I have the cash to play around and still build my savings and emergency fund.",1,0.522,0.994,NEGATIVE

This is a unique time in investing. While you wait, consider ultrashort bond instruments for yield farming, CD’s, Tbills, etc to keep your buying power intact. Verify everything you’re told and manage your risk but stay invested in a diversified way for your appropriate risk tolerance.",0,0.512,0.999,POSITIVE
