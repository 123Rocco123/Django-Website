,"TSLA - Tesla saw massive move to the up and it has now gone in over extended territory. Do not chase and wait for it to dip to support level at 271.28, BAC - Crossed over resistance of 44.26 and retested that level. It should keep going higher under lower interest rate environment. My immediate target (resistance) is at 47.24 MSFT - Good stock to go/stay longs. Unlike many other stocks that's hitting ATH, MSFT still hasn't flown away to hit the ATH. It's not the question IF, the question is WHEN. Immediate resistance is at 438/439. UPST - Upstart had great earnings and the stock went up by 24% in a day after earnings. The next immediate resistance is sitting between 86-95 META - Meta is going in a range at this point. The support is sitting at 558-569 and price coming to that area will be nicely bought. INTC - Intel had nice weekly bullish candle. There are few pivot (support) levels: 24.71, 23.56, 22.12. My immediate target is at 27.86 where it can face some resistance. AAPL - Apple has been going in a range. We need to look for a breakout/down. A close below 213 is a breakdown whereas close above 238 in daily chart will be a breakout. AMZN - Amazon had a breakout above 200. Will it retest or continue going higher? My target to above sits at 214 for now. AMD - Lot of people are looking at AMD. It had a bullish last week but I believe it still has some more room below before rallying. SOFI - Nice weekly breakout. Do not chase and wait for retest. The key level to retest is at 11/12 range. NVDA - Three weeks ago Nvidia had weekly breakout and then it retested those levels before continuation to the upside last week. I had given target of $154 last month and I believe it will hit that target.",Had to read the list twice to make sure I wasn’t hallucinating TSLA not being there. Lmao,0,0.504,NEGATIVE,0.999

Trump can give Elon a very less restricted environment. The path to Tesla has been cleared. All Elon has to do now is give people that one 'affordable' car and I believe Tesla can get back to $1000.",1,0.506,POSITIVE,0.991
