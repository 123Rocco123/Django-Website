Nobody in my family knows anything about the stock market so the internet is really my only source of knowledge on the subject. Thanks!,"No worries, it looks like SPYI and QQQI are high income ETFâ€™s and VONG is a growth ETF for large capitalization companies. A few small cap growth ETFs you can check out are ISCG, VBK, VIOG, or VTWG. These are only examples and not recommendations, but they should give you an idea of what youâ€™re looking for, just make sure you pay attention to the expense ratio which is the fee for holding the fund that covers management expenses on the fundâ€™s end. Iâ€™m not familiar with the app you use, but they may be a screener included in which you could filter a search for ETFâ€™s in a specific cap size/industry to make things a little easier. There are definitely other apps and websites you could use in conjunction:ETF Database: https://etfdb.com/screener/Yahoo Finance: https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/etf/new/TradingView: https://www.tradingview.com/etf-screener/Make sure to familiarize yourself with the fund before purchasing to avoid issues such as portfolio overlap, unsuitable diversity, or unnecessarily high expense ratioâ€™s.",4,0.52,0.823,NEGATIVE

Nobody in my family knows anything about the stock market so the internet is really my only source of knowledge on the subject. Thanks!,"I'll spare you the technical and fundamental analysis; given that'd take a while to explain.Medical/pharma: NVO (major), CORT (minor). I'm not a fan of LLY, or the typical moderna/merck/astrazeneca/pfizer.Industrial: AIRR (it's a good ETF)Energy: Green energy is all the hype, but traction's gonna take a while. I've invested in COP and WFRD. Both have strong fundamentals and are great firms.Depending on your risk appetite, you might dip your toes into disruptive tech, like blockchain, or innovative materials research, or aerospace research, etc.Utilities, services, infra get a little more complex. For example, PAVE is a good ETF. But ETFs in these sectors don't offer as much return as you'd like (Only Tech-based ETFs have great returns tbh). Better to go with specific stocks.Edit: Don't take any of this at face value. Do your own research, so you're comfortable with your choices.",2,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE

SOXX is a great investment in the semi-conductor space. IBLC is good for cryptos and blockchains.Smallcaps like GSC and AVUV are also a couple of other options.For the long term, a growth ETF could be used to hedge your positions, like SCHG (better than the generic VTI lol).",4,0.538,0.913,POSITIVE

Nobody in my family knows anything about the stock market so the internet is really my only source of knowledge on the subject. Thanks!,"Everyone floats down here Billy. ðŸ¤¡. Donâ€™t be a floater. Money only floats if you donâ€™t take out the gains. Sell high buy low. Donâ€™t be afraid to pull out the gains or your money will float. When buying stock always start off with one or two shares so you can get a feel for the direction of the market. Hold 60% and sell 40% when in the green. On the downside buy back in small increments of 3%. Keep some cash on hand to buy on the downside. If you go down one thousand make and investment of $500 that day. Focus on total value and not so much the amount of shares. At the time I could have bought 30,000 shares or AMD for seven dollars a share or Nvidia for $37 a share. Do the math. Nvidia wouldâ€™ve been a better play back when. You see? Blue chip stocks. Never ðŸ‘Ž buy a lot of one stock until you establish a baseline for the market movement in real time. Buy one ,two or three share and wait at least a month or week to see what happens. If it goes up hold until a minimum of a 10% gain. Then you will sell two shares. If your baseline price turns red from the start you buy at -3% -4% -5%-6%â€¦.. it takes 2 to 3 days for the average investor to sell a stock.Good luck",0,0.556,0.999,NEGATIVE
