,"Started investing in the beginning of this year, any thoughts or advice?","I mean this only with love and kindness but no, you’re heavily focused on speculative shit masquerading as tech.

,"Started investing in the beginning of this year, any thoughts or advice?",Find something that else that those companies have in common and add stocks that do the same thing.

,"Started investing in the beginning of this year, any thoughts or advice?","Buy NASDAQ and S&P 500 index ETFs for the bulk of your investment and then have smaller positions in 1-2 companies that you love that you'd want to hold hands with through a recession and put some fun money in them to watch.If you're investing for the long-haul it's not very exciting. It's literally my account automatically moves $1000 from my bank account to my investment account each month then I go in and buy more index ETF. I started investing in 2011 and the first two years I was looking at my account multiple times per day and watching all my stocks. Now I glance at it once per month and at income tax time.You're 20 and in a very good position. If the market returns an average of 8% per year, put 1.08 ^ 40 into a calculator. It's 21.7. Every dollar you invest now and the next few years will compound to be $22 by the time you're 60. Your biggest challenge now is to avoid putting your dollars into companies that are losers or go out of business between now and then. Putting your dollars into market ETFs is the best way to accomplish that.",0,0.551,POSITIVE,0.977
,"Started investing in the beginning of this year, any thoughts or advice?","I get being okay with taking on more volitile or speculative stocks. I certainly do the same. However you may way to step back from a few of those. PLTR is the only one that seems like it's worth the hold long term. Not FA just saying if this was my portfolio I'd be aiming at something more along the lines of a small cap etf with the coming rate cuts they should preform well for a while. Reits are also posed to do well with the rate cuts. I bought up a lot of O a few weeks back and habe done well so far. Or I can give you the boring buy reliable words ""just DCA into VTI"" its a proven strategy so dont put it off without giving it some thought. VTI is a badass ETF if u don't need that dopamine hit haha",0,0.523,NEGATIVE,0.763

,"Started investing in the beginning of this year, any thoughts or advice?",Look at insider selling for tech stocks. Tech layoffs. High interest rate macro environment. Buffet reduced Apple stake 50% holding highest amount of cash 277b for a reason. Market correction in the next 12 months. I would say actually around November time this year. May be the start. Consider small caps and mid caps. This is NFA. Good luck!,0,0.544,NEGATIVE,0.977

,"Started investing in the beginning of this year, any thoughts or advice?","Nothing wrong with being aggressive when you’re young. I just got my 18 year old, my 22 year old and my 30 year old kids into investing and their risk tolerance is a bit more than mine. I’m cool with it.All that said, I have a CFP wealth manager that helps guide my investments. He works for a bunch of people far more wealthy than myself (and I’m very well off) and his advice has been invaluable! I enjoy watching the advice here and on YT and other online amateurs but I’d never have the returns (or wealth) I enjoy without PROFESSIONAL guidance. He advises and educates my kids for free because he and I have made so much together. My POINT is… get professional advice from a fiduciary with a proven track record if you want to build serious wealth. The internet investing advice is more like playing a slot machine. There’s more shite advice than quality stock advice. You want someone that can look at your goals and your portfolio and give you advice that’s tailored to YOU AND YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION!I’m an only started investing with ANY seriousness about 10 years ago. Until then I just saved cash in the bank. Yes, I make a terrific income that gave me a great nest egg when I got started. Still, we thought I would probably have to wait into my early 70’s to retire - because I started around 46. I just retired at 58 because of my advisor (now one of my best friends!) and his guidance. I’m able to do whatever I want and I’ll never have to work again unless I want to. That’s pretty cool. It would NEVER have happened following YT and Reddit and similar. At the very least, sign up for something like CNBC Pro and maybe Cramer’s investing club. Watch financial news and get a pro to work with - THAT’S how you maximize your investments.Hope this helps. I’m no expert; but I know how to find GREAT experts to advise me. What they earn from me is worth EVERY PENNY! Good luck OP!",0,0.529,POSITIVE,0.989
