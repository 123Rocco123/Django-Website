,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD‚Äôs $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems‚Äô engineers will accelerate the company‚Äôs ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD‚Äôs data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees. AMD anticipates that the acquisition will positively impact its adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.
