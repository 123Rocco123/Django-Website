Without it going beyond your risk tolerance.You have $750 split between 9 stocks. Do you understand all these companies? Do you have a commitment to them?

My point of reference is a little skewed with the fractional shares, but my opinions are: Keep the tech and BRK/B. Dump the crypto related. Keep the gold.

,,"Market goes down market goes up. Over time the market has always gone up, not on the scale of months but years, but not all stocks will go up with it, some just drop until they cease to exist. You have a weird mix of good picks, terrible picks, and funds that only really make sense for people on the verge of retirement. Take the other guy's advice, buy index funds that track S&P, Nasdaq, etc. Put in whatever you can spare every month. In 10 years you will thank yourself. The alternative is keep going down this path then half your portfolio will be way up and the other half will be worth pennies. SCHD is a good alternative for JEPI. JEPI sells covered calls so when the market goes down it goes down and the dividend drops but when the market goes on a bull run the covered calls go in the money and you lose out on growth. SCHD pays lower dividends but if the market starts ripping you don't lose anything. JEPI is the kind of fund I would recommend for my grandmother who isn't concerned with 20 years of future gains and just wants to live off the investments she already has. Needless to say you just reinvest any dividends in the market and let it ride. Good luck, you sound young and time is on your side. Dreams of quick gains are nothing but a road to incredible losses. Take the easy gains, keep piling in money, when you get older you will be able to buy a house while all the people your age chasing easy money are still day trading in a one bedroom apartment.",1,0.527,0.991,NEGATIVE

While this isn‚Äôt financial advice, I personally stuck to individual stocks before I was playing with any meaningful amount of money. Personally, I don‚Äôt see much of a point in buying $700 worth of the S&P500 for it to be worth $7k in 30 years, when that $700 could be used to build knowledge in high & low risk stock plays, or simply buying books to learn everything you can about all types of investing (real estate, stocks, bonds, personal business, etc.).",0,0.537,1.0,NEGATIVE
