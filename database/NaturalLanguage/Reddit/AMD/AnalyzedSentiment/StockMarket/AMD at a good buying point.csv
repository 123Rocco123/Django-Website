,Been,Oh i thought you were disgusted he didnt know any,3,0.513,1.0,NEGATIVE
,Been,SOXQ has AMD as a bit over 7% of its holdings and a reasonably low expense ratio for a sectory specific ETF. SMH has performed better though and keeps AMD as a bit over 4% with a bit higher ratio. I like most of the top 10 companies in both though.,2,0.555,0.958,POSITIVE

,Been,"Careful, I made that point on Friday, a lot of NVDA bro‚Äôs didn‚Äôt like it. We are at the bottom, the market hasn‚Äôt fully responded to the IBM news. This is the time to buy.",0,0.542,0.645,NEGATIVE
,Been,What intel news?Edit: the guy i originally responded to stealth edited his comment to say IBM instead of Intel.,1,0.523,1.0,NEGATIVE
,Been,$8B not $8.5B from the chips act.,2,0.506,0.998,NEGATIVE
,Been,"You are right, I thought I responded to your comment at the same time that I meant IBM. I edited to clarify for anyone reading later.",2,0.512,0.991,NEGATIVE
,Been,"Dont think we are at the bot, nvidia still hasnt corrected yet.",1,0.522,0.999,NEGATIVE
,Been,Corrected for what. The market reacted mildly after earnings already. There was nothing in the ER that would signal the need for a correction. They are still the #1 in semi conductors by a mile.,2,0.534,0.994,NEGATIVE
,Been,120s,3,0.5,0.951,POSITIVE
,Been,Growth is slowing but still growing and no sign of stopping. There is no need for a correction. They already pulled back after earnings.,4,0.545,1.0,NEGATIVE
,Been,If it was going to correct as much as you seem to be expecting it would have after earnings. You are incorrect in your assumption.,6,0.536,0.992,NEGATIVE
,Been,Let‚Äôs talk tomorrow after it‚Äôs back over 140,2,0.502,0.623,NEGATIVE
,Been,"If it goes over 140, that would be clearer sign to buy. Rn, its just laying there like a fish.",3,0.528,0.999,NEGATIVE
,Been,It jumped this morning and crossed 140 a couple times in pre-market,4,0.56,0.998,NEGATIVE
,Been,"With both of them bear the same price, it just seems like AMD has way more room to grow in stock price.",2,0.611,0.939,NEGATIVE
,Been,"If everything was going their way, nvidia woulda jumped on earning. It was lukewarm. Analysts expectations being so high is why they cant ever meet market expectation.",3,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE
,Been,"Yeah, agree with others, it hasn‚Äôt created a new low yet",0,0.549,0.555,POSITIVE
,Been,"There‚Äôs some upside, but it‚Äôs not compelling. But it‚Äôs probably a better buy, now, than Nvidia or Intel.",0,0.554,0.912,NEGATIVE
,Been,I have an alert set for 120 then I will consider,0,0.515,0.549,NEGATIVE
,Been,Best way to miss on big gaiiiinzzzz,1,0.539,0.908,POSITIVE
,Been,Tom Lee has a buy at these levels. It's a trade with about a 10% upside according to his people.,0,0.541,0.97,NEGATIVE
,Been,"Yes! I bought some of myself. CNN does analysis forecasts, they're actually quite good! https://edition.cnn.com/markets/stocks/AMD52 analysts ranked their 1 year outlook for AMDThe high, beat case scenario is a 80% upside The median is 33% upside The low, worst case scenario is a 5.53% upsideNvidia had a similar forecast a years ago when I bought in Despite the fact I thought I was late to Nvidia.",0,0.538,0.99,POSITIVE
,Been,"These guys have been one of my biggest positions since 2018, and the matter with them is that a lot of different things could happen to this industry in the next couple years. Both sentiments could be argued against, all depends on what happens. Essentially, they have a very strong foothold right now and NVDA strictly benefits off of CPU manufactures doing well. Better CPUs with power draw / speeds, results in more GPU demand / efficiency as well.All of that being said, so many different things could happen to absolutely screech AMD's growth to a halt. Right now they are making their chips through TSMC and don't have any actual facilities to manufacture themselves, neither does NVDA, GPU chips are a much different process. You can't break into the turkey sandwich market if all you have is a pig farm. But you get the idea of how quickly that can change.Intel, oddly enough, does own fabs, but they continuously shit the bed. Those facilities can be 100 billion dollars once they're properly amended, so those assets alone will keep them from going under (imo*)",0,0.538,0.997,NEGATIVE
,Been,"Its okay, but no leg on it, so expect that it will crawl for some time. I dont see much immediate up or downside.",0,0.513,1.0,NEGATIVE
,Been,I see more downside potential. Waiting for a better entry point,0,0.515,1.0,NEGATIVE
,Been,What down side potentials?,1,0.51,0.954,NEGATIVE
,Been,"Number go down, obviously",2,0.493,1.0,NEGATIVE
,Been,Chart looks shit,2,0.503,1.0,NEGATIVE
,Been,"Yes, buy now. Their datacenter GPUs will be successful and have 10-15% market share over time vs their current 4% share (NVDA at 96%). The market isn‚Äôt valuing AMD like it will be successful but I think AMD‚Äôs customers want them to be successful, and the customers ultimately decide.More success in DC GPU = earnings double to $10/share @ 25x = $250 stock in a year. This isn‚Äôt shocking as the stock was $220 a few months ago on the same thesis.",0,0.604,0.968,NEGATIVE
,Been,AMD had diluted the shareholder 60% the last 10 years,0,0.635,1.0,NEGATIVE

,Been,"I bought 5 grand worth. It has good profits, even if it doesn‚Äôt grow much, I like the price.",0,0.528,0.991,POSITIVE
,Been,"I love US equities. You can look at a 120+ P/E company, say its a good buying point, and turn out right as well.",0,0.582,0.989,POSITIVE
,Been,AMD PE is not 120 hahaha,1,0.658,1.0,NEGATIVE
,Been,I believe it's 123,2,0.505,0.995,POSITIVE

,Been,"I would say $120 is safe bet. It may never reach, but it is not impossible.",0,0.514,0.981,NEGATIVE
,Been,"High P/E ratio with not great revenue growth prospect. Buy at your own discretion. Might be better off with LUNR, PLTR, and JOBY.",0,0.546,1.0,NEGATIVE
,Been,AMD does NOT have a PE of 100 - go do some research,1,0.621,0.925,NEGATIVE
,Been,"You're right, they have a P/E ratio of 124 lol",2,0.514,0.83,POSITIVE
,Been,Did you look into why?,3,0.525,0.957,NEGATIVE
,Been,"124 p/e!? You would be pretty insane to buy, people are buying it because they think it‚Äôs a budget Nvidia but it has none of the revenue or software infrastructure to support it as an AI play",0,0.554,1.0,NEGATIVE
,Been,Ofy‚Ä¶go full tilt on it. Seems legit. Better than some boring ETF like VOO,0,0.51,0.998,POSITIVE
,Been,"None, there high pe is because they bought a company. That's not the real pe.But I think people look at this and assume it is and stay away.",1,0.567,0.982,NEGATIVE
,Been,What would the pe be without the Xilinx acquisition? What was it at before that happened?,2,0.525,0.979,POSITIVE
,Been,The forward P/E is around 27. Gotta look at their non- GAAP reports too,3,0.515,0.997,NEGATIVE
,Been,"Ah yes, another person who doesn‚Äôt understand why AMD‚Äôs P/E appears to be inflated (due to Xilinx amortisation). Also, AMD‚Äôs largest revenue stream now is from the DC CPUs and GPUs, similar to what Nvidia has, so it‚Äôs more than just parts for your average PC.",1,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE
,Been,Can you help explain the higher P/E reason further?,2,0.529,0.87,NEGATIVE
,Been,"Most sites use GAAP income to calculate P/E ratios. Neither GAAP nor non-GAAP is the automatically the correct figure to use. GAAP tries to keep everyone using the same rules, but it tends to bulldoze things that matter and includes paper expenses.For AMD the biggest thing GAAP is including is amortization of acquisition related intangibles, which are huge for AMD relative to their income. That paper expense just serves to lower taxable income, so it saves on taxes, but blows up the P/E ratio. I think in their form 10-k, the amortisation write offs will be there for at least another decade, given the size of the acquisition (~50 billion).non-GAAP isn‚Äôt the end all be all either, it leaves companies free to remove things that definitely are expenses.",3,0.526,1.0,NEGATIVE
,Been,Ya everyone on the cutting edge of AI development is buying those AMD processors‚Ä¶it really shows in their earnings.,2,0.589,0.984,POSITIVE
,Been,It‚Äôs market cap doesn‚Äôt give it much room to grow,1,0.539,0.992,NEGATIVE
,Been,Yes and no,1,0.5,0.982,POSITIVE
,Been,It sure is assuming it goes up in the future. Otherwise no it's a terrible time to buy,0,0.542,1.0,NEGATIVE
,Been,Only if you want sit on it one year or more,0,0.674,0.76,POSITIVE
,Been,Yeah definitely good place to have money destroyed,0,0.518,0.98,NEGATIVE
,Been,"NVDA almost has the same quarterly income as AAPL, hence the valuation. AMD on the other hand‚Ä¶ purely speculative valuation lol",0,0.545,0.622,POSITIVE
,Been,I'm going to pull out (giggity) tomorrow. Take my profits and wait for this baby to heat up again mid to late 25'.,0,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE
