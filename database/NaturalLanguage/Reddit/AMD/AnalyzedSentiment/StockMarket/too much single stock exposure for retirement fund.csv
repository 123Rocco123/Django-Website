For planning purposes, you could conservatively plan on doubling your money every 9 years if the S&P returns on average 8% a year which is lower than what it has been recently. So after 27 years, you could potentially end up having $4 million with very little effort on your part. That's just one scenario, you get the idea.It's possible to make significantly more than that if you are a good active investor. Keep in mind, however, that seven out of eight active investors fail to beat the cumulative return of the S&P 500 over a 10-year period.
