,,"Good on you investing in your future. A few things I would do in your current position and these are fairly broad points since I‚Äôm not fully aware of your position in life.Consider transitioning to a Roth IRA if you believe you‚Äôll make a higher income in the future. In a Roth IRA, contributions and withdrawals are tax free. The ultimate question to ask yourself is do you think your tax rate will be higher or lower in the future? If yes, switch to Roth.Your portfolio is all over the place. Get out of stocks and invest in some solid index funds that follow the S&P500 and can make dividends. If you want to gamble in stocks, then an individual brokerage account.This is personal preference, but get out of get your IRA out of Robinhood. Rollover into a more reputable company like Vanguard or Fidelity. Robinhood is a meme.",0,0.526,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,I agree with 1 and 2. RH offers aggressive bonuses for IRAs that may force reputable brokers to follow suit.,1,0.505,0.845,NEGATIVE
,,I agreed with all above but aren‚Äôt the Roth and the traditional basically the same thing in the long run since you get taxed on both just in different ways?,1,0.518,0.995,NEGATIVE
,,"Not in the long run because you don‚Äôt pay taxes when you withdrawal from a Roth after 59 1/2 because you pay taxes now. Traditional is taxed as ordinary income when you go to withdrawal at 59 1/2 (its pretax monies) there‚Äôs a reason they have a limit for roth and not trad, also if they were the same people wouldn‚Äôt do back door conversion. Another big thing is RMD, Roth has none.",2,0.512,0.999,NEGATIVE
,,"Yeah, Roth is just taxing you now and traditional is taxing you at the of withdrawal",2,0.5,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,... so you're just buying fractions of all sorts of different companies. Why don't you just buy an ETF instead lol,0,0.539,0.879,NEGATIVE

,,Too much,0,0.525,0.998,NEGATIVE
,,"If there‚Äôs one thing I learned in my 20‚Äôs, it‚Äôs to not over-complicate investing. Not everyone believes in investing, but if you‚Äôre going to do it (and you should, good on you for starting early) just buy and hold an index fund, best example is any index fund that mimics the S&P 500. If you want to be a little more sophisticated, you can delve into specialized ETF‚Äôs/Mutual Funds that focus on a specific sector or philosophy of investing, but no matter how you delve it up, most of these funds are going to be heavily weighted with the mega cap companies (Apple, Meta, Microsoft, etc). There‚Äôs no sense in putting some money in SPY, and some money in VOO for example. Just choose one and be done, they both do the same thing.I would just pick 1-3 funds and invest regularly, that way you are riding the waves and picking up shares at a discount during market downturns. Just my two cents. And remember, you won‚Äôt get rich quick with this method, but at 22, you have SO MUCH TIME. Good luck!",0,0.521,0.989,NEGATIVE

,,"I‚Äôm not going to look through each one to see if they are good or not. If I had over 10 investments, I would not be able to live with myself, and my account is a tad bit larger than 8k.
