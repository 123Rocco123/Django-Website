,,"Yes, we are in a bear market with rising interest rates. What did everyone expect? Bunch of bullshit guesses of a pivot or a pause or any stupid wish that we could go magically higher. Too much F‚Äôking money that every one has trying to make something happen. We are going lower as rates go higher. I‚Äôve mentioned before we need to see a 40 % down Nasdaq, a 28k Dow and at least a 3400 SPX where everyone will get scared shitless and get out and then the long term players can finally get back in. The Fed is finally taking the punch bowl away and letting the gamblers lose their money. You could see this coming a mile away. Just too many young investors never dealing that yes, you can buy the dips as long as you realize you may bloody your hand on the falling knife. I don‚Äôt know what kind of holiday season we will have but the consumer may either buy because there‚Äôs no tomorrow or save their money for the high priced groceries, doctor bills, high gas prices and losing their job. The only good news is ‚Ä¶ one day next year it may all be over and the sun will shine again. Se la vie.",0,0.526,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"Pretty sure every one of them say that 4% gives you a 95% chance of success over 30 years not 70. And by ""went on too long"" you must mean the whole history of the stock market which has included crashes far worse than this one.What's your assumption now? That stocks will stay down and just never recover until the end of time? Remember they'd have to go perfectly sideways or somehow continuously dwindle downwards for it to be a bad idea for the monthly investor. People get tied to ATH's and think we somehow need to reach them again for anyone to break even despite the fact everyone's average buying price is way way below that.",1,0.527,1.0,NEGATIVE
