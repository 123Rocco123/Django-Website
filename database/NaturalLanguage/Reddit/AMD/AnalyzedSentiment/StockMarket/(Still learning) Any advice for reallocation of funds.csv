,"Still new and have been DCAing as best as I can, I feel now Iâ€™m too tech heavy, do I leave this and full send tech over next 5 years or shall I reallocate funds, any advice/opinions appreciated",I think youâ€™re solid. Iâ€™d have 4-5 of my favorite long term individual stocks and allocate the rest of your investments into VOO and forget about it.,0,0.531,POSITIVE,0.994

,"Still new and have been DCAing as best as I can, I feel now Iâ€™m too tech heavy, do I leave this and full send tech over next 5 years or shall I reallocate funds, any advice/opinions appreciated",Iâ€™d leave personally and just add into an etf if you want less exposure. Tech will continue to do well long term,0,0.539,POSITIVE,0.939

,"Still new and have been DCAing as best as I can, I feel now Iâ€™m too tech heavy, do I leave this and full send tech over next 5 years or shall I reallocate funds, any advice/opinions appreciated",I didnâ€™t even know that existed thank you - recommend averaging it slow or do you think now is a good time for a lump sum? May I ask what percent you have allocated to it?,1,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Still new and have been DCAing as best as I can, I feel now Iâ€™m too tech heavy, do I leave this and full send tech over next 5 years or shall I reallocate funds, any advice/opinions appreciated","Oh, and you can do lump sum or dollar cost average in. I prefer lump sum so you can capture all compounding. But if you buy and it falls it hurts to see. Dollar cost averaging removes the emotion from the process",2,0.521,NEGATIVE,1.0

,"Still new and have been DCAing as best as I can, I feel now Iâ€™m too tech heavy, do I leave this and full send tech over next 5 years or shall I reallocate funds, any advice/opinions appreciated",VONG is a bad idea but if you really want a growth etf then do SCHG. I wouldnâ€™t do either right now. Plain old BRK.B is my play for the next year,2,0.558,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"Still new and have been DCAing as best as I can, I feel now Iâ€™m too tech heavy, do I leave this and full send tech over next 5 years or shall I reallocate funds, any advice/opinions appreciated","Right now I my Roth IRA is 70% VONG and 30% IWM, the latter because I want to capture gains from the great rotation.

,"Still new and have been DCAing as best as I can, I feel now Iâ€™m too tech heavy, do I leave this and full send tech over next 5 years or shall I reallocate funds, any advice/opinions appreciated",August is usually a sketchy month for the US markets. I would be expecting big dip opportunities to buy. Maybe hold off buying anything until mid August.,2,0.538,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"Still new and have been DCAing as best as I can, I feel now Iâ€™m too tech heavy, do I leave this and full send tech over next 5 years or shall I reallocate funds, any advice/opinions appreciated",That's market timing for sure. Maybe buy 1/2 VONG and 1/2 FXAIX but going full VONG will suck for you if we have a recession.,1,0.544,NEGATIVE,0.999

,"Still new and have been DCAing as best as I can, I feel now Iâ€™m too tech heavy, do I leave this and full send tech over next 5 years or shall I reallocate funds, any advice/opinions appreciated","Began moving cash into VOO, doing it slowly incase it drops further, I have not sold anything since the mini crash. Iâ€™ve learnt from this post ETFs are important and 5% on it is quite low so I aim to increase it to 30% over time. I personally am buying more AMD, MSFT and AMZN over time aswell, and did buy more yesterday so I am ready for the next bull market however long it takes.Any new moves or new ideas from your end? Wishing you luck in this market",1,0.569,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Still new and have been DCAing as best as I can, I feel now Iâ€™m too tech heavy, do I leave this and full send tech over next 5 years or shall I reallocate funds, any advice/opinions appreciated","It looks like that may have been the move. If Japan is contained this might just be a flash correction. The mag 7 will take the hit, but I bet QQQ and RUT will snap back quickly",2,0.508,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Still new and have been DCAing as best as I can, I feel now Iâ€™m too tech heavy, do I leave this and full send tech over next 5 years or shall I reallocate funds, any advice/opinions appreciated","Letâ€™s hope man, best of luck, you opened anything new yesterday/today?",3,0.574,NEGATIVE,0.993
