,"Hey Everyone, First time posting on here. Me and my fiancé are working on reallocating our money in our retirement fund to reduce some risk to the downside over the coming year. Right now 100% of these funds are in a general S&P index. We are thinking about selling 80% of that and basically reinvesting in what would essentially be a variety of indexes that make up the S&P, with some of the riskier sectors left out. Plan is to hold these for at least 6 months, possibly longer depending on economy. Let me know what you think. 20% S&P index fund, XLK - 5%, XLI - 5%, XLP - 20.25%, XLU - 10%, XLB - 2.5%, XLV - 18%, XLC - 5%, XLE - 5.5%, 5% Sin Stocks - BUD, TAP, MO, PM. Essentially we’re leaving out Financials, Real Estate, and Consumer Discretionary. Remaining 23.75% we plan on using to DCA into individual stocks we like for the long run - Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Semiconductors (Nvidia, AMD, etc), etc.","XLE, XLB are the worst to be into heading to recession. Commodities will be hammered hard. I’d allocate a high portion to Altria stock and buy a long-term put option to hedge and collect the dividends",0,0.544,1.0,NEGATIVE

XLE is one we plan on having a tight stop loss on. That one is more related to China reopening and inflation creeping back up second half of the year. Basically historically as the dollar decreases in value, XLE has performed well. That’s one I’m ok with riding it while it’s working and then taking the W and moving on.",1,0.534,0.969,POSITIVE

Just buy the index etf. Don’t buy a mutual fund that charges a fee. Those people can’t predict the market no better than you or me.

(looking at yield around 4.5%+) and put the other half into canned food and shotgun stocks... ie the consumer stocks that have resisted deflation... which is to say military or supportive contracts as defense will get funded in the spending bill regardless.. and people need to eat.. so, food or related non deflationary defensive.. just don't overpay for these, look for bargains in the red candle moments. as for me, I feel I'm ok with letting my stocks ride since I have more than a 1 year window on retirement and fairly confident no company will file bankruptcy.. what one DOES also look for if your horizon is long term is, answering the fundamental question, are ANY positions that you hold going to be dogs with fleas.. under-performing the market for an EXTENDED period of time, losing you money?? if so, drop those pretty fast... basically holdings without dividends can be your worst nightmare if they remain depressed for a long time and a significant chunk of the market is, well.. just that.. in good times, the herd will pull things forward, in bad times they fall off a cliff, but you don't know where the edge is. BTW, if you've been in the market for a LOOONG time, look at your stocks objectively, in a big pullback some stocks will be worth ADDING to, vs losing money on as the multiple gets chopped in half sorta thing. For example.. I bought some Chevron and Exon when they were in the toilet with negative oil price... fundamentally were these companies going bankrupt with everybody still driving? No.. now they are 2.5x that buy in price.",0,0.538,1.0,NEGATIVE
