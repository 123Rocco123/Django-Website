,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold some/all MAG 7 stocks and market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts. I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved. PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don’t ask about earnings because I typically don’t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like “Thoughts on _____?” or “Why isn’t ___ on the watchlist?” or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion. If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you—doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I’m still long or short a stock beyond what I update. News: US Vote, Economy Top of Mind at Saudi-Hosted Forum DJT -Massive upmove in the past month, (and yesterday) going to be hands-off in this stock unless we go parabolic (make a HUGE move like 55 -> 100 in a single day). Not interested in playing the long, and multi-day short is extremely dangerous. TSLA - We finally saw the stock pull back a little from a close to 30% upmove, watching $275 level at new highs. Currently short but will likely cover today. PYPL - Reported better than expected third-quarter earnings but missed on revenue. EPS of $1.2 vs $1.07 expected. Revenue of $7.85B vs $7.89B expected. Deteriorating margin, missed revenue, and guidance all underwhelm. SOFI - Revenue of $697M vs $623M, EPS of $0.05 vs $0.04. Raised guidance and cited members growth. Overall seems like good news, but not sure why stock is selling off. Watching at open. MCD - Reported quarterly earnings/revenue beat, but cited fears to ecoli outbreak affecting sales. Said that there might be an effect to Q4 members. Beyond that, nothing too interesting in the earnings. Earnings: GOOG, V, AMD, PFE, SNAP, CMG, FSLR, RDDT, QRVO (GOOG is most interesting earnings I'll likely trade)",How are you playing goog? I have some 170calls that are up an ok amount. I’m looking for someone to convince me to hold them through earnings.,0,0.523,NEGATIVE,0.999
