You can keep a very small amount of stocks that you truly believe in for the long run. But for the rest, keep it in etfs and add when you can and what you can afford. For the rest, enjoy your time with what truly matters: friends and family.Edit: stick with vanguard world etf.

You have decent returns on some and losses on others. I‚Äôd trim your portfolio down so it is mostly ETFs with a few stocks that you understand and can actually justify why they will increase into the future. Lmao VOO and SPY aren‚Äôt ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù, it‚Äôs just you seeing a number greater than a couple hundred and not understanding the value of the index.Edit: look how much your Roth has outperformed your brokerage. Your brokerage returns are trash considering the market we‚Äôre in.

VOO and SPY are quite expensive‚Ä¶","If this is just the stocks part of your portfolio, I think you're doing good but I would personally cut back on most of the positions, I have a single stock right now and at any given time I have maybe 3 if I'm feeling good about 3 specific companies, I think you should put half of it somewhere safe like bonds or SMP and half of it into a handful of stocks you can really delve deep into assuming you have other things going on in life it's just a lot more manageable to keep track of the earnings and balance sheets and that type of stuff of a handful of companies, also I don't like people telling you to just put it in the SMP right now because we're in a huge bull market, the SMP usually has a down-run and that's where the average 8% return comes from, since this year it would've been a lot more than 8% it's likely at some point it will come down by a lot and we'll see much more realistic returns, if you genuinely want to just keep your money there until you retire it's not as big an issue but still something to consider tbh.",0,0.536,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"As mentioned in title, looking for advice on what I should do more‚Ä¶ maybe stop diversifying in my individual? Any low cost stocks I could invest for my retirement? VOO and SPY are quite expensive‚Ä¶","SPLG is good and SPY is the same thing with higher trading volume. One or the other is fine, but probably not both. For QQQ I would swap it out for QQQM, it is the same thing with a lower expense ratio. Keep KO if you believe in their long term plans. VTI? Your large-cap growth needs are mostly covered by SPLG and QQQM. So, I see 2 options. 1) get rid of VTI and find a good small-cap value-focused fund. 2) If you'd rather hold VTI, you could probably drop SPLG and QQQM.So the TL;DR: Option A- sell everything exept VTI and put it all there. Option B- Sell everything except SPLG and QQQM. Then add a small-cap value fund. You can keep KO in either scenario if you want (i hole KO and plan to, so I am biased on it.) Etfdb.com may also help with researching.I'm no expert, just basing this on what I've learned and seen as good options. Best of luck!Edit: didn't see page 2 of the screenshot. I still stand by what I said. Be sure you double check the companies and understand their individual risks. Holding single stocks can be a lot more volatile than a good ETF especially if you don't understand how to value a company. Entirely up to you and your risk tolerance though.",0,0.535,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"As mentioned in title, looking for advice on what I should do more‚Ä¶ maybe stop diversifying in my individual? Any low cost stocks I could invest for my retirement? VOO and SPY are quite expensive‚Ä¶","VOO and SPY are both S%P 500 ETFs and SPY has a higher expense ratio. Just do VOO, between them.Im using Vanguard ETFs here but other equivalents are also fine, I just know their names. These are all index based funds that maintain proportional investment in companies by value. This means that VOO is something like 7% NVDA, and VTI is more like 6% NVDA.VT - Total world market - This is a maximally diversified fund that literally covers all public companies in the world according to their market cap. Adding anything to VT will make you less diversified among stocks. I bet that VT is approximately 4% NVDA as a point of reference.VTI - Total US stock market. This single ETF covers everything domestic.VXUS - Total international market, no US. The purpose of this is so you can match with VTI if you want to be heavier in US or International compared to buying VT. Personally I have 90% VTI and 10% VXUS for example.VOO - This tracks the S&P 500, so it's large US companies only. VOO makes up about 80% of VTI.VO - This is roughly speaking the US minus the S&P 500, covering small and medium companies., it makes up about 20% of VTI.The price of the shares doesn't really matter.You're probably better off putting your money in index funds now than you are speculating. You can play around with some of your money (say 10% of the brokerage account), but you don't need a huge pile of different ETFs to be diversified. I don't think you need to sell the investments you've made as it's not a ton of money, but I think you should be focusing on adding index funds, completely ignoring what the market is doing. Just automatically buy the same thing every month.",0,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.985
