,"Got some nice news today when I checked my investment tracker—up $1,000! #TSLA is definitely carrying the returns even though it's only 5% of my portfolio. Being the single largest donor to Trump's campaign is working out for Elon (and me). What surprised me, though, is seeing other stocks like Coca-Cola (KO) and some REITs reacting negatively, dropping by about -4%. It makes me wonder why certain sectors seem to be moving in the opposite direction. It looks like today’s heatmap is showing a clear trend: sectors like consumer non-durables and health tech took a noticeable hit, while finance and tech stocks are up. Interesting to see how varied the reactions are across sectors—maybe it’s tied to post-election sentiments or a shift in investor focus? Anyone else noticing similar patterns in their portfolio? Heatmap by sector: Happy post-election day to everyone.",Real estate is dead,0,0.513,NEGATIVE,0.999
