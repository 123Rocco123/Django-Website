,"Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities. This is a daily watchlist for trading. I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on ____?” will be ignored. News: Israel Bracing for Potential Direct Attack From Iran in Days GL- Allegations of insurance fraud while they received millions in kickback scheme (yesterday’s news). Likely not going to trade this today but still worth watching. CPNG- Raised paid membership fees (this is their equivalent of Amazon Prime) ZTS- Report on WSJ from potential side effects of Librela, pet arthiritis medication that may kill them JPM- Reports earnings beat of 4.63 adjusted vs 4.18 expected, but notes that inflation will continue. Does not change guidance, disappointing investors. AMD/INTC- Chinese Ministry of Information and Technology tells China Mobile to phase out use of foreign processors (namely AMD and INTC processors by 2027). Longer-term watches: NVDA/SMCI, SNOW, BA, ULTA",Negrito,0,0.5,0.993,POSITIVE
