,"No positions in any stocks long-term but FAANG/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers) To clarify since I've been asked: I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open.

NS- to be acquired by Sunoco for $7B in stock. M- rejects $5.8B cash bid, saying it is not good enough (21/sh). Sycamore Partners possibly emerging as new bidder. SAVE, liquidity 9/10- Next possible catalyst is if the merger is terminated, massive sell orders come in and I play the bounce (if the move is massive).
