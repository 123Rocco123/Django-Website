,,"25% in dividends at 18 is WAY too high. You want MAYBE 5% of your portfolio as dividends and bonds.The S&P500 is like 40% tech. No reason get tech stocks on top of that. If you want to go tech heavy, buy QQQM instead of individual stocks.",0,0.538,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,"Just feels like an inefficient concept for an 18 year old to be waiting on a company to drip feed him enough dividends to buy more of that same company instead of buying into a company that is simply reinvesting that money back into itself.It's also not very tax efficient, which presumably shouldn't be an issue if he is using a retirement account, but who knows.",3,0.613,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,"BCE has dropped 27% in the past 12 months and did next to nothing in the previous 4 years before that.It's down 25% since 2007.I mean, if that's the best example you can give of a company choosing to pay out free cash flow instead of reinvesting in itself, I don't know what to tell you. You literally couldn't have picked a better company to prove my point for me.Declining earnings, next to zero revenue growth, paying 90% of free cash flow out in dividends whilst not buying back shares (despite a 13 P/FCF ratio) and increasing debt and having their stock price fall rapidly.Granted, I've not done a deep dive beyond looking at IS and BS, but why on earth would you put forward that dog to try and prove your point?

,,Props on starting at 18. Wish I did that.My only advice is to go to r/bogleheads and read the wiki.,0,0.501,0.999,NEGATIVE
,,"So here's the advice I'd give if I could go back and talk to my 18 year old self. First, are you sure you won't need that money anytime soon and are okay with potentially losing some in the short term? If you are, then great, you can invest it. Stick with ETFs for now, whichever you'd like although VOO is understandably pretty popular here. Set your account to reinvest dividends and invest more whenever you have more disposable income.Now what do you do? Go learn. You're 18, you don't know anything yet. And that's not an attack. Maybe you're brilliant. But there's a lot to be said for experience. Warren Buffett didn't magically pop out ready to be Warren Buffett. People love talking about how early he started, but he grew up in a household where his father owned a brokerage firm and he studied for years under Benjamin Graham; there was a lot of instruction, education, and experience that went into that success. So go read up on Bogleheads like someone else suggested and see if you still think stock picking is worth the effort. Learn how to research and value a company. Paper trade to test what you've learned. Emotion can be a killer in trading so pay attention to how you feel with your paper trading (not perfect because it always feels stronger when it's real, but if you're feeling FOMO/greed know that that can make you jump into a trade too early, or if you're getting too upset about losses you could abandon a good trade too early). Watch the market and companies on your watch list for a while to see what impact different macro and micro events have on their performance. Read about different strategies people employ, not to try to copy directly, but to see if there are elements you'd want to incorporate in your own trading.Then when you're ready to trade, you'll be doing it from a stronger starting position: better informed and likely with a lot more capital to deploy. Good luck! You're already in a better spot than most by thinking along these lines as early as you are.",0,0.531,0.998,NEGATIVE
,,You don’t need dividend stocks at 18. You’re purely in growth mode.,0,0.544,0.918,POSITIVE
,,"Seems like a good way to start. I know people are going to say just put it all in VOO, but I like to have more exposure to certain companies. If I was just starting out, I would probably do something similar. Just be sure to hold and don’t panic sell if you see short term losses. The reality is none of those companies you have listed are going anywhere in the next decade. Best of luck!",0,0.521,0.991,POSITIVE

The current stock value is only based on EV car production and sales. Look up Cathie wood’s Tesla analysis...even if the lower end happens it will be the generational wealth. There will be an upcoming announcement about the robotaxis August 8th, which may have been postponed (still has not been confirmed) You could also invest in QQQ and reap higher returns than the VOO and s&p 500. With the small amount you are allocating, just think about tsla. The other investments I would push you towards is not stock but into the crypto rhelm. Bitcoin, and Solana. Educate yourself via YouTube on why these are amazing investments. Read the Bitcoin Standard. Hedge yourself.

,,"I would say invest however you feel most comfortable. The most important thing is that you’re investing so early, and your investments will have time to grow. With time you can grow your investments through compounding interest and compounding frequency. I don’t see anything wrong with what you’re investing in as long as you feel comfortable with it in your portfolio. With the right strategies dividend investing is fine. I would suggest if you are investing in dividend stocks to throw them in a Roth IRA so dividends don’t get taxed, and you can reinvest the dividends back into the stocks through DRIP plans. If your employer offers a 401k, take advantage of it especially if they offer any type of match. Also, if you’re in good health and get a HSA it might also be a good option for you. These are just a few other options you might have that could help save on taxes. Ultimately, it’s your choice on how you invest and you’ll have to live with your choices. Some choices will be good. Some choices will be bad, but the important thing is to learn from your wins and losses. Try to do your due diligence on your investments, try to set goals, try not to invest on emotion and save.
