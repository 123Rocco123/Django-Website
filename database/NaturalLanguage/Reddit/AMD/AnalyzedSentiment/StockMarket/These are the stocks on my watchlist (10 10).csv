,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold some/all MAG 7 stocks and market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts. Some stocks I post may be low market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on _____?” or something answered in the watchlist will be ignored unless you add detail and your own opinion. If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you—information is meant to be shared in open discussion. I am not answering questions if I’m still long or short a stock beyond what I update. News: Stocks Fall as CPI, Jobs Go in ‘Wrong Direction’: Markets Wrap SPY/QQQ/VIX/market indices - CPI increased by 0.3%, higher than expected, while unemployment increased mainly due to states affected by the hurricanes. Fairly stable CPI report otherwise. TD - Pled guilty to DOJ charges regarding money laundering case. DAL - EPS of 1.50 vs 1.52 expected, revenue of 14.59B vs 14.67B expected. Cited that CRWD outage resulted in a 45 cent hit to adjusted earnings. NCLH/CCL/other cruise names - We saw a lot of cruise names jump due to a 30% upside call from an analyst from Citi (James Hardiman), worth watching at the open to see if we have another similar pop. TSLA - Robotaxi event tonight. Worth watching for unusual order flow before the event. AMD event today at 9 AM. Likely going to fade the news",You weren’t wrong about the amd event fading lol. What’s your plays on TSLA?,0,0.554,POSITIVE,0.765
