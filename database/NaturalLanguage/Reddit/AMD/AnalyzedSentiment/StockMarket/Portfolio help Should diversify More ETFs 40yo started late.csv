,I am 40yo Started trading 5-7 years ago have done well but I feel my portfolio is very high risk.

I‚Äôd consider adding some broadly based funds like regular VOO or VTI.You don‚Äôt have sell, just don‚Äôt buy more of the same stuff and ‚Äúrebalance‚Äù by changing your future contributions.MU is the only one I‚Äôd really consider dropping but I‚Äôm not super familiar with them and it looks like you might have bought at their peak. 14%+ total loss is pretty significant though.",0,0.522,1.0,NEGATIVE

VTI captures the whole US market, so less risk/concentration, but slightly less returns historically vs VOO. VTI has slightly higher expense ratio at .05 vs VOO‚Äôs .03.I hold a majority position of VOO but it‚Äôs really just personal preference and risk tolerance for your other positions.Either way, nice portfolio though dude üëçüèª",2,0.514,0.881,NEGATIVE

Also, congrats on the +100% ROI on AMD, you‚Äôve just outperformed the market so you‚Äôre on fire.Though, I agree with u/Syndicate_Corp , $MU has really taken a hit. Not much upside right now on the fundamentals and they aren‚Äôt rewarding long-term shareholders the dividends for a reason to stick around.Disclosure this is not financial advice by any means, I am a graduated student with a management degree and certificate in derivatives and fintech but not a financial advisor. But if you‚Äôre looking around to find a new stock I like $AVGO (Broadcom) they have 1.23% dividend yields (better than $MU), very good fundamentals and an upcoming 1:10 stock split on July 12th. I have purchased 10 shares on June 25th, 5 at $1585 and another 5 at $1700 on the 1st of July. Aside from the politics, Pelosi has just bought call options reported 3 days after my initial purchased shares. Last time she bought call options was NVDA at the $500 share price range, I think we all know how that went and the fact that maybe (most likely) she had insider information on US government semiconductor grant to TSM establishing manufacturing in the US (Phoenix AZ).Such could be a situation for $AVGO, if you‚Äôre not considering to buy id perhaps keep it on your watchlist üëçüèª.",0,0.536,1.0,NEGATIVE

Depending on whether you‚Äôre in the green or red. If you‚Äôre up a good chunk never hurts to sell half or a quarter. I always do when I‚Äôve reached 100% or 50% when I feel that the market has changed. If you‚Äôre working with a lot of cash at stake always dollar cost average and buy small and incrementally.I like AVGO because it‚Äôs not a direct hardware competitor on graphics cards. They handle the network/software side of the AI with growth needs with the ASIC chips required to operate the network demand of hardware needed to keep these systems online. They also handle the needs of companies in internet service providing on the hardware/software side. AVGO‚Äôs acquisition of VMWare is also tapping into subscription servicing fees rather than the original perpetual licensing of their software which VMWares previous owners hadn‚Äôt tapped into. Sounds like money to me, they have dozens of Fortune 500 companies using their systems which would likely cost more to replace than keep.",2,0.541,0.84,NEGATIVE
