,,"As a runner, I have the 55. Im not super tech so I don’t need fancy, I’m not a triathlete either that would need any of the more technical features that the triple digit models offer. The 55 has many features that are very user-friendly, all kind of sports to chose from, battery life for me is great. The only con is the face being on the smaller side than other models. It could be difficult sometimes to glance at it while at pace especially in the dark.As a bike racer the old Edge 520. Does what I need it to do no complaints lolI think for the price (on AMZN), the features, the 55 is a great watch for the beginner to the avid runner.",2,0.509,1.0,POSITIVE

,,"The micro-trend's bullish consolidation on both the SPY & QQQ pierced, and more importantly closed, above their flag's celing, but much more so on the SPY than the QQQ. As a result, the SPY is considerably closer to major resistance than the QQQ (e.g. $8 on the QQQ vs. only $2 on the SPY). Of note, SPY did close above its 200 DMA, whereas QQQ remains below its 200 DMA.The fact today's move occurred on comparatively high volume (144M & 75M respectively) suggests institution's participated, as opposed to only retail investors.Critical for the bulls will be a SPY close above at least 407.68 and a QQQ close above at least 293.47. Regardless, with so many resistance levels above current price, upside will stil likely be limited in both price and duration.",0,0.515,0.977,NEGATIVE
,,Finally some green. December - LETS GO!,0,0.515,1.0,POSITIVE
