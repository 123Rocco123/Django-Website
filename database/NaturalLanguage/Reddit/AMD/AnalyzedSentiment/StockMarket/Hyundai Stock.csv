I was looking at the car stock since I drive an Ioniq 5 and am super happy with it.

The only thing im not too fond of is as i wrote the infotainment system but i just use apple car play for that.On that note, Volvo, Polestar, and others that have adopted google android infotainment system are doing it right.

So far I am absolutely loving the car - GV70 3.5TT with sport prestige package - but Genesis is going through some growing pains. Most dealerships are just a small corner of a Hyundai dealership and parts can be on a long backorder. But beyond that, I cannot complain. Your money goes further with Genesis. Much further. The question will be reliability. Making the switch from Lexus was a tough one. In 12 years of Lexus ownership, I never had a breakdown and was never at the dealership for anything other than maintenance. Their reliability and service was hard to let go of, but Genesis is killing it with their lineup and price point at the moment.",1,0.515,0.766,NEGATIVE
