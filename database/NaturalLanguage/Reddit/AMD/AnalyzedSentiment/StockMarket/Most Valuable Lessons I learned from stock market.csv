I mean, they can be, if you just randomly buy deep OTM options because they are cheap and then hold them too long, hoping that the stock will skyrocket or plunge. Sure, that's kind of like the lottery.But options should be viewed as tools and they can be really valuable to someone who knows what they are doing. They can provide leverage, they can be used to hedge, they can be used to lock in gains, they can be used as ""insurance,"" and you don't have to be the one buying you can sell them as well. They can be extremely flexible - they don't have to be lottery-style gambles.Say you are a value investor and own 100 shares of some ticker at $10/share, that suddenly has a huge catalyst and moves to $18. But say, you still believe in the underlying company or that you don't think the surge is over. You could buy a put option that gives you the right to sell your stock by x date for $15 per share and basically lock in gains without completely capping your upside.Or in that same situation if you think the volatility is over, you could even just sell a covered call to pad your returns even more, with no risk of loss outside of opportunity cost (having to give up your shares at the option price instead of the actual price, if you are wrong and it keeps surging).There are a lot of ways that options can be used to actually lower risk. They aren't just gambling.",2,0.532,POSITIVE,0.613

Why not NVDA? because every person smarter than me says that capital is going to be rotating into small caps, and that NVDA has had its run, still won't stop me from scalping their contracts when I see a clear opportunity, and to be fair to others, I have all the free time I need to sit and stare at the charts during the days that I trade, so that's favorable to my situation and might not apply to many others.honestly, if you want to stay away from options, it's probably a personal, self-control issue. There is a reason the derivatives market is like a quadrillion dollars, which is so ridiculously big it's saying something fictional like ""gorillian dunkeroos""You can learn options pretty fast, but you have to understand that getting involved means you're now sitting at the table with masterclass players. You may be able to win a hand or two, but these top guys are coming for the whole pot, and they are willing to lose some on the way there. You can protect yourself with personal rules and leverage much better. Right now in a bull market it's much easier to get behind opening standard positions on stocks or ETFs, and if that's what you want to do, that's what you should do. But in a bear market? oh there will be pain.for beginners, protect yourself with rigid rules:1.) only stake x% of your account per trade2.) have bailout indicators (x loss = sell)3.) probably start by just buying contracts, ideally with paper trading first (thinkorswim app)4.) understand why sellers get burned and why scalpers do consistently well with larger amounts of smaller trades5.) understand IV crush6.) understand theta7.) put options can be used as insurance, on positions you already hold, to minimize your lossesif you do these things there is literally less risk than actually staking your cash into a security. derivatives won't be going away anytime soon so I suggest people stop shrugging this off, simply because such massive amounts of people treat it like a casino. You don't have to treat it like a casino. You can treat all* trading like a casino, and if you do; you deserve the consequences of the risk you adopted.edit: i don't grammar i just eat crayons",0,0.515,NEGATIVE,1.0

Even if it went to 15 in January, for a company like Intel, I would no doubt take the $400 and hold my shares long termAnother example is actually one I did recently but it was more of a meme play:-I bought ARDX after decent q3 earnings and bought a OTM $6 put at the same time.-the next day I saw 15% gains and sold, I still had the contract though-the stock plummeted to like $4.50 I think, and I cashed out the contract too-it cost me like under $20 to get that contract and I ended up making upwards of $100 from something I was trying to play safeThese are extremely rough numbers since I'm not digging through my account to get the exact P/Ls but I hope you get the idea. If I'm ever doing speculation plays / meme stocks I will almost always buy in 2 different positions, same with options, I almost always straddle (buy both Call/Put same time, different strikes) and try to take the smallest loss with any gain.If I see green, I just go for the profits. I tested this recently by telling myself ""maybe I'm just too quick to take gains"", because I was haunted by a singular PLTR $52 Call that expired in mid December. I saw $500 gains one day, went to $400 the next day, and I sold. I haven't bothered looking up how much that call would've been worth if I held, but JFC I imagine somewhere in the thousands. All because I liked them and wasn't sure if I wanted to increase my shares.So, this has been a mouthful, sorry for that, but; When I went against that thesis, and I told myself ""Okay, I'm going to be more patient and not take gains so quickly"" I immediately felt incredible pain. It was literally this week I tested this out, and I went from making $1200 Monday - Wednesday, to losing 400 this Thursday-Friday. Still up for the week but man I will never sit on a gain again.I trade, I don't invest. Know what you are, if you are comfortable with the ups and downs of being an investor, and you have the ability to have your capital locked up in an illiquid state, fine. I have 20% of my account allocated to that. Bought FTEC, VOO, and QQQ and I'm not fucking touching it. The rest of my account is for active trading, and I will take gains hastily without regret for the rest of my life loledit: to further affirm what I said, the $400 I lost this Thurs-Friday, were all on contracts that were up at least $30 at one point. One was up +$100 and I ended up closing it at +$8. loooooool.",2,0.538,NEGATIVE,1.0

This is how I practiced after my free trial expired, but by all means if you like the software and want to subscribe to it, there's nothing wrong with that.most people (myself include) scalp options with their daily settled cash, my strategy is very simple, literally just SMAs and MACD, specifically the 9/21 MAs.
