,"Seems like every time once I buy into a stock, it instantly goes back down. Fell into the rabbithole and went into penny stocks. Made a good amount, got greedy bought back in at its high and drops all the way down. Bought SMCI and ASML when they dropped significantly. Thought that was it but went back down even more. How am I doing so far?",If you are looking to actively trade buying after stocks have major increases in a short time frame doesnâ€™t usually workout.If you are looking to hold for years then you will have to get use to seeing red from time to time.I would also wonder what made you chose these specific stocks?*Stay away from penny stocks,0,0.537,NEGATIVE,0.997

They wonâ€™t grow as fast but they are also less volatile.It all boils down to time horizon and risk tolerance.,2,0.548,NEGATIVE,1.0

You have no guarantee itâ€˜ll go higher still but it can drop down just as quickly and then youâ€˜ve lost like 80+%.",2,0.506,NEGATIVE,1.0

Those kind of stocks are usually pump and dumps, if u are day trading maybe it will be fine, buy it, get some profit, and sell. U should never hold those stocks for more than afew hours imo.",0,0.533,NEGATIVE,1.0

How am I doing so far?","Looks dumb I know. But from my observation with penny stocks, even though theyâ€™re up 500-600% in pre-market, they will always go up abit more before it drops back to starting price.Which was true, as I did pump and dump for VS and got some good profit out of it. But greed got me as the price kept going up really fast, FOMO and bought back in and it instantly drop.Well lesson learned on stupid penny stocks, will study more on them before buying any.
