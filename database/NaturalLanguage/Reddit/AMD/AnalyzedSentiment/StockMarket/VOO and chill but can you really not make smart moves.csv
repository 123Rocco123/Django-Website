,"Hello, 21 year old here I understand some things have been proven over time, like ETFs boglehead philosophy etc. time in the market over timing the market but what about words like ""be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy?"" When you are young, let's say early 20s, this is the time to take risks isn't it? Every right risk you take now, compounds like crazy, every mistake? You are young you can still recover and learn. I'm not saying dump 100% like wallstreetbets gambling, but I'm talking about investing in stuff you believe in, despite the temporary bad financials or pr or being undervalued? For example, I am a software/hardware engineering student, and I was a gamer as a child. I knew a lot about companies like Intel, AMD, Nvidia etc. In college I knew Nvdia was gonna blow up because of CUDA and what not, AMD would blow intel out of the way, QCOM I was a fan of because I did some research on their chips. These are very entry level knowledge, but if it's enough for me to believe in working for these companies, isn't it enough to invest let's say 10%, 20%? Instead of dumping all into HYSA T bills and VTI/VOO VXUS etc and using 5% for individual picks? If shit goes down market goes down, I saw the covid crash happen infront of my eyes, I had 10k savings from my first internship, I could have bought these shares I believed so much in, but I didn't, it stayed in a HYSA. Sure you might not pick tesla before the run or nvidia, but you can pick amzn msft goog amd and if all these become bad picks and fail me then I don't think I should work for the tech industry right? If tech fails I fail because thats what I'm going into, and if I can risk my career for a job in such a ""volatile"" market then why can't I ""risk"" 30-50% of my portfolio in the same tier companies? Can someone experienced help me out with these thoughts? To me at this age it seems like VOO will get you the american dream comfortably, but VOO and good picks will make you rich, and if the market really fails dotcom and whatnot, you have to keep faith in the market and keep earning, some company will rise and if you are in the scene you will know about it, right? Could people, in tech, working for cisco or nokia, really not see the future of aapl and msft back in the early 2000s? Was it really that blinding?","Invest in things you believe in, sure. But don't sway away from what truly works. Don't bet it all on 1 asset. Diversity is key. Last thing you want is to be down big even if you're young. Be smart man.",0,0.513,0.936,NEGATIVE

If shit goes down market goes down, I saw the covid crash happen infront of my eyes, I had 10k savings from my first internship, I could have bought these shares I believed so much in, but I didn't, it stayed in a HYSA. Sure you might not pick tesla before the run or nvidia, but you can pick amzn msft goog amd and if all these become bad picks and fail me then I don't think I should work for the tech industry right?

To me at this age it seems like VOO will get you the american dream comfortably, but VOO and good picks will make you rich, and if the market really fails dotcom and whatnot, you have to keep faith in the market and keep earning, some company will rise and if you are in the scene you will know about it, right?
