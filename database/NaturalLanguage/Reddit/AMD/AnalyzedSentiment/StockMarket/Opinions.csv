,I am 19 and I invest about 5 dollars a day in QYLD- 1$ NVIDA- 1$ SPY- 1.50$ JEPY- 1.50$,"First of all congratulations on starting early. You will thank yourself. Good job. Second at your age if you just concentrate on broad ETFs that is the best path for most. You will hear this over and over. If it were me I would just invest the $5 per day in VTI, VOO or VT. SPY is very good but the others i mentioned have lower expenses. I don’t think you need any JEPY at your age. The rest of these companies may well turn a profit but you have time on your. $100 per month in one of the ETFs above will work wonders with compound growth. If you want a little more tech exposure you could look at QQQM in addition or VXUS for international. It boring investing that way but it works. I would check out r/bogleheads if you are interested in this way of investing. Just my 2 cents but you will probably hear the same here. Good luck.",0,0.528,0.98,POSITIVE
,I am 19 and I invest about 5 dollars a day in QYLD- 1$ NVIDA- 1$ SPY- 1.50$ JEPY- 1.50$,do you think I divid that 100 into 4 different ETFs and it would be better? Or should I stick to a single one?,1,0.526,1.0,NEGATIVE
,I am 19 and I invest about 5 dollars a day in QYLD- 1$ NVIDA- 1$ SPY- 1.50$ JEPY- 1.50$,"If it were me and I knew what I know now at your age I would put all $100 per month in VTI or VOO. These are very diversified funds. There are over 3,700 stocks in VTI alone. I put the link below for the top 50 holdings. I think it is a better strategy than what you have above but I am just 1 person. I am 49 and I can tell you this strategy has worked well for me and I will be able to retire early. Once I got a solid base in a broad based fund (FXAIX in my 401k, equivalent of VOO) I branched out a little to include VXUS, QQQM and BND. I don’t think you need bonds at your age.Like I said SPY is also a great choice but has a little higher fees.Just remember investing at your age you can’t do much wrong by picking good individual companies but I believe a broad ETF is the ticket. I would build a solid base in 1 and then branch out as you age. Just 1 man’s opinion. I wish you luck.https://stockanalysis.com/etf/vti/holdings/",2,0.531,0.987,POSITIVE
,I am 19 and I invest about 5 dollars a day in QYLD- 1$ NVIDA- 1$ SPY- 1.50$ JEPY- 1.50$,"I would say you should choose a combination of VOO (big caps), QQQ (tech heavy, overvalued), VNQ (real estate, significantly undervalued but benefit the most when interest rate drops next year), XLF (finance), XLE (energy, high dividend, good for diversified), XLI (industrial), BIL (short-term government bond, no risk, 5.2% annual return guaranteed).Basically, instead of choosing individual stocks, you should invest sector ETFs that you believe will benefit the most given the macroeconomic conditions. Given interest rate will drop next year, tech and real estate will benefit the most. But tech sector is already priced in to some extent, so real estate is the best place to invest.Ideal portfolio: 50% QQQ, 50% VNQ*Disclaimer: this is my personal insight of the market based on my investing experience over the last 7 years.
