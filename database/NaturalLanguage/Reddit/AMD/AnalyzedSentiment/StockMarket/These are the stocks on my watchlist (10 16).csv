I think this was a largely overblown piece of news. It may affect some sales but in the grand scheme of things it's a drop in the bucket. Assuming it even gets drafted up and pushed through government.Is it really oversold or is it realistic that based on their earnings report, the hit to their forward guidance justifies the massive drop in market cap?I guess my basic question is will ASML rebound in a reasonable amount of time (pre next earnings) or is it going to be one to two earnings reports away from getting back to the 850-ish price it was at?",2,0.54,NEGATIVE,1.0
