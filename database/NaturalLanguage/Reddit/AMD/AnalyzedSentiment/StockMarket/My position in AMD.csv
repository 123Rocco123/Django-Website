,"I started trading options a few months ago in my free time, and I'm highly obsessed with it (despite the inevitable losses and the time it diverts away from med school). Started with a few thousand and have slowly grown the portfolio, mostly through option plays. I attribute some of my success to luck, but of course that's always part of it. I've seen the influence traders can have. It likely won't hurt me to share my buys. Current position involves option plays on AMD extending beyond July. AMD has benefited from AI surge but individually has yet to capitalize on AI like their competitor. It's likely we will see change June 3rd at Computex 2024. Their recent X post is also mildly suggestive of change, because why else bring attention to an event where your competitor is also present if you have nothing great to share. The other good indicator is the recent influx of politicians buying shares, never a bad thing when these mfs start buying something. Finally, global demand for semiconductors is here to stay. AMD is a massive company with great positioning to supply the ever increasing demand. If anything they likely have continued growth and stability in the market with minimal chances of major depreciation.",Good point about AMD. I personally agree that AMD had no show yet their potential into AI run.So I am looking for some entry points at calls or Leaps.,0,0.584,0.968,POSITIVE

Even if AMD doesn't significantly increase its involvement in AI (which I find very unlikely), they are still anticipated to perform well, making it a relatively safe investment long-term. But I have no doubt that AMD is planning a strategic move into the AI sector. They are better positioned for this than most companies.",1,0.587,0.996,POSITIVE

Problem is that if you were at least a bit familiar with the AI space at slightly deeper level than just using ChatGPT to cheat on your homework’s, whole thing runs on tensorflow neural network using CUDA cDNN and other NVIDIA made tools. Nvidia literally invested into their AI toolkit and made it completely free, but it all only exclusively works with NVIDIA GPU’s and it’s also been optimized for over a decade",0,0.545,0.998,NEGATIVE

(and there is) after the dust/chaos settles, all other factors being equal (they never quite are) the biggest players going in, tend to be the biggest players going out (in spite of the overuse of the term ""disrupters"" - who almost never really are, otherwise they wouldn't have to keep bragging about disrupting).So, to sum up. Yeah, the eventual big players in A.I. are going to be the big players in it now, like AMD, DELL, Microsoft, NVDA, GOOGLE, etc. But there's a lot of chaos between now and then, and you could lose all your money playing risky games while that's going on.",0,0.525,0.985,NEGATIVE
