,"With Nvidia stock price approaching all-time high, it could be also a good time to invest in AMD, which once hit an all-time high of $161 in November 2021. Stone Fox Capital believes chip demand should back to growing mode as the inventory adjustment comes to an end. The company is strongly bullish on AMD, saying with the stock only rebounding to $100, it should has plenty of upside in the next few years. AMD shares had once fallen all the way to a history low of under $55, and its data center CPU market share still has nowhere near Intel. As the market expected industries such as personal computers to start recovering, AMD rallied all the way to $100. Counterpoint Research estimates that AMD holds about 20% of data centre CPU market in 2022, up from nearly 12% in 2021. In 2022, AMD generated $5.75 billion in revenue from data centre CPUs. If the company doubles its market share to 40%, its revenue will jump to $11.5 billion, while Intel holds a 50% market share. With the launch of the new chips, AMD is expected to benefit from the huge demand for generative artificial intelligence (AI). The potential market size for AMD could soar from US$79 billion in 2020 to US$300 billion in 2027. And getting back to $100 is only the beginning, as this is where it should be in last year. Stone Fox Capital believes that AMD is on track to gain another $100 in the next few years, considering its P/E ratio is still less than half of Nvidia's expected P/E ratio. Prior to the PC inventory adjustment, AMD's gross margins were close to around 50%. Higher margins and total revenue is driving the company's eps rising significantly. Analysts have lowered their eps targets due to the weak demand environment and are now targeting above $4 and $5 for 2024 and 2025 respectively. Considering that these estimates are based on limited revenue growth expectations, there is still room for further growing. Anyway, AMD's shares are trading at just 23 times of its 2024 eps target. Stone Fox Capital's previous research showed that AMD's revenue was only US$32 billion, but its eps was close to $6. Stone Fox expects the chip company to reach its target level much sooner than analysts had predicted due to a rebound in end market demand, and AMD taking more market share from Intel in the server market.

Stone Fox Capital believes chip demand should back to growing mode as the inventory adjustment comes to an end. The company is strongly bullish on AMD, saying with the stock only rebounding to $100, it should has plenty of upside in the next few years. AMD shares had once fallen all the way to a history low of under $55, and its data center CPU market share still has nowhere near Intel. As the market expected industries such as personal computers to start recovering, AMD rallied all the way to $100. Counterpoint Research estimates that AMD holds about 20% of data centre CPU market in 2022, up from nearly 12% in 2021. In 2022, AMD generated $5.75 billion in revenue from data centre CPUs. If the company doubles its market share to 40%, its revenue will jump to $11.5 billion, while Intel holds a 50% market share. With the launch of the new chips, AMD is expected to benefit from the huge demand for generative artificial intelligence (AI). The potential market size for AMD could soar from US$79 billion in 2020 to US$300 billion in 2027. And getting back to $100 is only the beginning, as this is where it should be in last year. Stone Fox Capital believes that AMD is on track to gain another $100 in the next few years, considering its P/E ratio is still less than half of Nvidia's expected P/E ratio.
