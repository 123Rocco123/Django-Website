,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold MAG7/market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. Some stocks I post may be <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on _____?” or “Is ___ a good investment?” will be ignored or I’ll troll you unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll. News: JPMorgan Says Three Quarters of Global Carry Trades Now Unwound President #45 to make a news conference at 2 PM in Florida- speculation that Vance may be switched out. May position in the VIX (VXX) pre-announcement and have a tight stop. LUMN - Watching $8 level for today, recently reported earnings. Stock has been stronger than expected despite pullback. LLY - Reported blowout earnings- raised guidance from $13.50-$14 to $16-16.60 for 2025. EPS of $3.92 vs $2.60. Revenue of $11.3B vs $9.92. Watching how this will trade at the open but will be light because stock is so high priced. SMCI - Reported earnings two days ago, stock is still extremely weak. Will watch at open, but currently hands off for now due to high price. Other semi-related stocks/ETFs I’m watching: AMD/ARM/MU/SOXL/NVDA/NVDL. Still long NVDA. ASTS - We saw a pretty big spike yesterday, they got cleared to operate Bluebird direct-to-smartphone satellites from the FAA. ASTS needs closer to 20 satellites (and plans to launch 168). I think an offering might be imminent from the way they need to raise capital. Not sure how else they can secure additional funding at that high valuation. Will elaborate in another post. DDOG - EPS of 0.43 vs 0.35e. Revenue of $645M vs 623M expected. Guides increase in revenue. Earnings of note: SOUN, ELF, PARA, RKLB",ASTS🚀🚀,0,0.5,POSITIVE,0.938
