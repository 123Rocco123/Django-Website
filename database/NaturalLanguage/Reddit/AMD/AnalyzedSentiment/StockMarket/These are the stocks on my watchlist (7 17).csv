,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop trader who trades equities. This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all the stocks on here, or none of them, and stocks not on here on any given day! I only hold MAG7/general broad market indices long-term, unless otherwise noted in the ticker. If you use old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly. I usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. Some stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on _____?” or “Is ___ a good investment?” will be ignored unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll. News: US Floats Tougher Trade Curbs in Chip Crackdown in China Mainly focused on chip companies today. NVDA - News linked above. Other chip stocks I’m watching: ASML (also had earnings premarket), AMD, LAM, SMCI, SOXL/SXS (levered chip ETFs) INTC - Moving up because it’s a domestic chip company (demand for it is increased for it as a result of reduced competition). GTLB - Exploring sale. TSLA - Interestingly had a bit of a bounce from selling off intraday yesterday, still biased negatively. Currently short. FIVE - Named COO as interim CEO. Expects saves for Q2 to be $820M-826M, falls short of revenue expectations of $836.6M. EPS was $.53-.56, missing .63e Earnings: UAL IPOs: None I’m interested in","Honestly, I'm new to reddit but not trading. And I would say that these picks are safe. Shy of a disaster can rest assured they will perform.",0,0.563,0.997,POSITIVE
