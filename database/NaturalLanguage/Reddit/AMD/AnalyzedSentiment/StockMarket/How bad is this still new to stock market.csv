,,"I don‚Äôt see a rhyme or reason to your picks. Maybe you have one and have conviction, I just don‚Äôt see it. Just sell it all and buy VOO or VTI. Then research what you are doing. When you think you are getting somewhere maybe try to branch out if you want. I am older and almost all of my portfolio is in broad ETFs. It‚Äôs boring but effective for me.
