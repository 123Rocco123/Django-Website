,,"Probably an overreaction for the semiconductors in the short term. But really bullish long term, the wide adoption of AI in the future for businesses and just consumer products makes it seem like semiconductors will be needed even more for processing power. I imagine AI being as accessible as everyone having an phone within 10 years. I‚Äôve done barely any research though and this is straight speculation. One down side is that AI can just be straight cloud-based, which I can see the lack of need high level semiconductors in every phone/consumer product, but I guess businesses still need them to still make those cloud-based AI.",0,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,"In my opinion, and wtf do I know, but semis are going to be the new 'FAANG' group because of compute power needed by every industry to move forward using modern tech. Looking at GPUs for everything. There's no way that demand for chips is going to decrease. I'm super bullish and continuing to add more to my portfolio.",0,0.554,0.997,POSITIVE
