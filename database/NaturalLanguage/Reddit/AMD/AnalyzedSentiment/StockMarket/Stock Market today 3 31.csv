,,Higher highs and higher lows. Exactly what the SP500 has been doing since October lows. If it passes 4180 then again higher highs. It will drop again and most likely be a higher low. Makes a pretty solid case for a turnaround,3,0.521,1.0,POSITIVE

America has been bullying people around with their over inflated dollar now it‚Äôs being abandoned‚Ä¶ and you know what has been drowning America‚Äôs economy? The woke agenda. The green new deal. Here we have Yellen talking about global warming shit when the entire world is going to crap and America is about to be ganged up on even more. But here I am getting -17 likes.

,,Fair enough and well said,2,0.727,0.994,POSITIVE
,,"No worries. But imo, I think it‚Äôs more likely we‚Äôre coming to an end to the bear market. Reason being: 1. interest rates aren‚Äôt going up /that/ much higher (although we‚Äôre going to be getting the lagging effects in the real economy) the stock market prices have ‚Äòpriced in‚Äô the rate increases already and can only really factor in flat/higher for longer/cuts next year. And 2. Historically, a down year only happens like 20% of the time, and even rarer two years in a row.I am optimistic but also very cautious from here out.",3,0.56,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,So march. Thu current bull rally of higher highs and higher lows for the SP500 started in October. It‚Äôs as clear a pattern as you can get. So I don‚Äôt think your 300b explains it when it‚Äôs been in that trend for months already. Also the green today was dude to macro news on CPI front.I don‚Äôt think you really know what you‚Äôre talking about,3,0.529,0.697,NEGATIVE
,,"You calling this a ‚Äúbull rally‚Äù tells me YOU don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. My statement implies that the 300b recently printed will stimulate the market in the short term which is what is happening now, which isn‚Äôt sustainable considering the Fed just erased a whole quarter of QE by printing that much money. It‚Äôs unsustainable & inflation will rise again because of it, thus prompting the FED to continue raising rates which will inevitably cause a continuation of the current bear market.

,,"I mean it‚Äôs weak and a small sample size of a few months but it‚Äôs a clear higher highs and higher lows pattern. You clearly have a Definition In mind of a bull rally being a year. But they all start with a week then a month etc.Like I said the ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù one, since October, is indeed the pattern of one. Whether it lasts, who knows, but signs point to it. Especially if the sp500 can pass 4180, the last high.You‚Äôre just an extremist with narrow vision. Your statement of it stimulating the market right now is like you pushing a car while someone in the car pushes the gas and you claiming it was all you. Like yeah sure there‚Äôs some impact but it‚Äôs not the real driving force making it move. And that‚Äôs evident because the current pattern started in October, WELL before this stimulation.",5,0.537,1.0,NEGATIVE

If you look at the inverse yield curve ( long term bonds have a lower yield than short term bonds) you may lessen your exposure to stocks in the next year.
