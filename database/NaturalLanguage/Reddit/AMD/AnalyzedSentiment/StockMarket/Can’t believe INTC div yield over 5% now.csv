,,"Love this stock, value, dividends, perfect for selling options on cuz it's predictable.(I'm aware the dividends can be suspended)",0,0.576,0.997,POSITIVE
,,Intel has underperformed the market for 20 years. Still i can see value now,0,0.576,0.994,POSITIVE
,,"I don't understand why it underperform' so bad tho, generates a steady 20 billion in profits every year and has a low P/E ratio, share price basically didn't change for 4 years while generating crazy profits.I guess ppl only invest in growth and don't care about cash generators",1,0.546,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,Why not? Risk free short term is 3.5 -4.5%.INTC has potential issues and is in a sector that had a large decline. It makes sense it would have a 5% yield. It should probably have a higher one to be enticing unless you are betting on the turn around.,0,0.522,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,Intc has been around so long and shrinking every day. W/O above avg payout its stock will not be attracted as much.,0,0.553,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,$PNGAY is doing 7% yield and it's for sale at $8.93 per share LOLEDIT: 7.93% according to my Fidelity account,0,0.552,0.696,NEGATIVE
,,"Do you think you're the first one to find a div. yield higher?Everyone knows there are larger yields, I'm sure you can understand that isn't the only thing to consider.",1,0.541,0.963,POSITIVE
,,"Speaking of.... ;) I drunkenly bought $2000 worth of SBSW a couple months ago at $9 because precious metals seems like another good hedge against a recession, and some random redditor in WSB noted their dividend was something like 12 or 14%. and that they're down like 50% from their highs due to a strike or something like that that I'm sure will be addressed. Who am I kidding I literally know next to nothing about the company but at this point I'm just like fuck it let ride. It can't do much worse than the rest of portfolio this year, and 2 G's isn't going to make or break me lol. Sometimes you just gotta say screw it and be a degenerate gambler.",2,0.547,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,The dividend really is great. Which makes me wonder about a bunch of short calls on Intel that were left unexercised on Friday even though it was the ex-dividend date. Did information come through late in the trading day on Thursday that kept people from exercising calls for the dividend?,0,0.515,0.655,POSITIVE
