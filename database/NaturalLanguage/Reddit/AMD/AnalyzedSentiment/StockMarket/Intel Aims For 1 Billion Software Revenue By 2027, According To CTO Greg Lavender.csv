By the end of 2027, the cumulative revenue from its software business could reach $1 billion. In 2021, Intel achieved over $100 million in software revenue. It was during this year that CEO Pat Gelsinger brought Lavender from cloud computing company VMware to guide the chipmaker's software strategy. Since then, Intel has acquired three software companies. I have a goal of getting to $1 billion of software and developer cloud subscription revenue, Lavender said, I think I'm on track to hit this goal by the end of 2027 ... maybe sooner.
