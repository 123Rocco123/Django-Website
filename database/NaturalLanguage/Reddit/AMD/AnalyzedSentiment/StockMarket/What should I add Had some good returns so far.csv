,These are only my individual stocks. Already carrying a bunch of ETFs so these are my extras to play with.,"Penn and other gambling casino stocks are consumer cyclical. Penns purchase of the ESPN name doesn’t mean they are making money relative to other casinos. I haven’t paid much attention to their purchase, I only know that other casinos with more favorable house rules and better promos (mgm FanDuel and DraftKings to name a few) have a much better and reliable product.The latest debacle of ESPN bets is the promo of cmc getting a touchdown.They had a promo for it and as I understand it they are marking it as a “loss” to the better because the promo wasn’t clear that it needed to be a rushing td (he caught a td pass a rec td).This pissed off a lot of people I don’t know if they are deciding to mark the bet a win to the better or the house but it was initially marked as a win to the house.If you alienate your regular gamblers they will migrate to other apps.I think a casual better might use ESPN bet for the name recognition which is what penn is counting on.However, your revenue stream is going to be from regular users of the product.ESPN bet has a terrible product.",4,0.513,1.0,NEGATIVE
