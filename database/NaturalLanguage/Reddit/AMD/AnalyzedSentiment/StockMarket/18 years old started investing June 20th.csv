,"18 years old started investing June 20th I am still learning the ropes to the market, and I know I should be thinking from a long term perspective, but seeing myself down 179 in such a short period of time (2 weeks) really stings man. I want to diversify my portfolio, as it is obviously very Tech Saturated, and while I have had my fun choosing individual stocks, I think I want to start focusing on safer ETFs for my future, but I have no idea where to start. Open to criticism and critiques.","At your age, you should focus on the long term as you have a better time horizon than most investors.ETFs are the recommended approach for most investors because most people are not willing to do the work required.If you are interested in investing in individual stocks, use a Fair Value Calculator to determine their worth. I’ve been using Stock Finance Pro on Google Sheets. They automatically pull company financial data into Google Sheets with just the ticker symbol. The data feeds multiple valuation models to help you understand how much you should pay for a company’s stock.",0,0.554,POSITIVE,0.786

Open to criticism and critiques.","I'm 19. Please don't overthink investing, at our age we simply don't make enough money. Focus on trying to earn more instead of playing with numbers on a screen. Even a 100% increase on a grand only nets you an extra thousand, that's peanuts. Of course, this changes if you have a job and aren't a college student. Nonetheless, I'd just open a ROTH IRA and dump everything into VOO. If you want to be fancy, split it up and buy every month with whatever you have so you can capitalize on a potential discount.",0,0.528,NEGATIVE,1.0

So buy an index fund like VTSAX or VTI or VOO and set up automatic monthly deposits from your bank. This is best done in a retirement account, preferably a ROTH vehicle so no taxes when money is withdrawn but know the rules before you start. You can do all this at Vanguard. This is autopilot. Now figure out a career path to maximize your income and happiness.",0,0.52,NEGATIVE,1.0
