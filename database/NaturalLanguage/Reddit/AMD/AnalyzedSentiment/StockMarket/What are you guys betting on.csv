,,A lot of people on r investing will likely not admit or realize no matter how much info or data you gather. No matter how educated your decision. You can't predict the future and it's in essence gambling,2,0.508,0.997,NEGATIVE
,,"In which case everything is a gamble and the term is meaningless. But it's not because the word was created to describe something more narrow, a risk substantially greater than regular risk. That's why no one considers crossing the street akin to Craps.",3,0.51,0.999,NEGATIVE

,,"That’s profit or loss. And in so far as everything in life is a gamble, you will learn to make a distinction between trading on sentiment and actually knowing enough or doing enough to give yourself an advantage.

,,"Amazon is getting ready to print $70-100 billion in FCF this year after only doing $36 billion in 2023. They’re finally pulling all of their profit levers after all these years of mediocre earnings. 3rd party seller services, AWS, ads, and subscriptions are all working in synergy with each other to produce high margin revenue. Simultaneously, Amazon is on a mission to make their business more efficient, giving them massive operating leverage. Robotics will help them tremendously with this over the coming years when they further automate massive portions of their business.Buying Amazon now is going to be like Buffett buying Apple in 2016, except the upside is going to be even better. Amazon will have so much cash in the coming years that they’ll be forced to hand it over to shareholders. Amazon hasn’t even begun paying a dividend yet or repurchasing shares. Expect their returns to be amplified moving forward because of this. I fully believe that Amazon will be the world’s first 5 trillion dollar company.",0,0.546,0.769,NEGATIVE

,,"Not exactly. They are not too much into that for the consumer market (yet), but for datacenters and supercomputing you might want to take a look at the ""nvidia grace CPU"". And maybe Nvidia tegra as well for gaming consoles and low power stuff.They are also planning to expand into the consumer market in the short term. Still not many details on that but you can be 100% sure that they wont let the competition (AMD+intel) do both gpu and cpu without getting into that as well.Why do you think they tried to acquire ARM otherwise?",2,0.549,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,"Its AI focus tech company. Its product is quite amazing: tailoring its AI product for very specific industry/company.Eg. In health care, it will analyze patients' data, track diseases, etc. In energy, it will keep track of maintenance, assets management, etc. Government, financial, supply chains, you name it, and they will tailor it for u. Heck, recently, they tailor it for warfare as well! Read the news, and you found out.Only time will tell me if there is time everyone will use it like ""Microsoft thingy.""Take caution, tho. Microsoft also developed something similar called Microsoft Azure. But we will have our answer soon, in march, there is a high chance the company will be listed on sp500.
