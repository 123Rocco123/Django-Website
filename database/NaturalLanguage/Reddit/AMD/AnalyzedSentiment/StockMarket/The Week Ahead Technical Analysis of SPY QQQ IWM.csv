,"OVERALL: SPY showing the weakest chart with a potential breakdown back inside the bear channel. IWM closed right at its bear channel ceiling, so Monday's candle could lead it into a potential breakdown as well. QQQ holding up the best, with at least a minor support level between current price & its bear channel. With prices sitting within so much support, probabilities would favor a bounce Monday; however, the regional bank sector crisis throws probabilities out the window. We'll see... SPY: Potential breakdown back inside the bear channel; the prices to watch are a close below 384.32 -- or -- a close above 389.30 -- that will officially determine the breakdown (or not). If a breakdown, major resistance is the 368.79 level of convergence between double bottom and COVID ascending TL. If not a breakdown, then major resistance would be around 423.50 as price would be moving within a bullish parallel channel. QQQ: Price closed below the 50 + 200 DMA necktie, but just above 283.98 convergence of 100 DMA and ascending TL off the Oct 2022 lows; probabilities suggest this level will need to be tagged and therefore could see more downside early next week to hit this level. Major support remains down at 270 former bear channel ceiling; aforementioned levels are just minor support. First resistnace is 301.70 descending TL from the early Feb 2023 pivot high. Major resistance is now 334.42 (now longer the 311 triple top) as the down move we are seeing could technically be all inside bar, bullish consolidation from the Dec 2022 to Feb 2023 up move. The bull case is unlikely, given the events of this past week, but nevertheless worth mentioning because the chart is the chart, after all. IWM: Price fell & closed into major support; probabilities would suggest a multi-day/week bounce from this level, but the SVB collapse, & weakness across the entire regional banking sector as a result, certainly cannot be ignored. If downside continues, 170 should provide some support, but the next major level is 162.76 - 160.40 where triple bottom & an ascending long term TL converge. Any bounce would see first resistance at 181.45 (gap-fill and 200 DMA), as well as 187 -- major resistance is 197 - 202 (ascending long term TL and double top). I will play a lot of catch up here since it's been over a month since my posting (work & life have a tendency to do that). In summary, I closed 24x trades, of which 22x trades were winners vs. 2x trades were losers.

First, NFLX earnings, I bought puts with only 30 or so DTE and the down move did not come in time. Had I just shorted, the trade would've gone differently.
