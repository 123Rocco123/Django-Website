,"What is up my Degenerates, Chest to the Sun and Positive Vibes. For those that do not know as of late I am dealing with a family matter, health issue with my sister, that has my attention. So for the duration until this matter is solved, things will be a bit of touch and go with the DD and TA and Content on my end coming into this month. Not to say I will not be here nor trading which I will but it will be off and on or sporadic at best. Bear with me, Family first. Alright, Alright, Alright to start, were coming into the biggest earnings week yet. We have $GOOGL, $AMZN, $META, $AAPL and $AMD all report this week along side the economic data. We also have #Fed, #PMI and #NFP this week. Starting out he week, Monday is a dead day. -Tuesday though is a banger with: *9am S&P/case-schiller home price index *9:45 Chicago PMI *10am Consumer confidence In the morning $CAT reports and is expected to beat In the afternoon $AMD reports and is expected to beat -Wednesday is the biggest day of the week, mid day 2pm, #Fed decision and remarks from #Powell. A 25bps is expected (Refer to chart Fed watch-tool) This will be the biggest action in the market by far this week. This may also determine that we are one or two meetings away from peak rate and if this is the case then we are looking at again (March-June) timeframe for peak and reasonable to assume the fed will cut sometime after September. We will have to see if it will be this yr still and or they will hold rates and will cut in 2024. Wednesdays data: *9:45am S&P Global Manufacturing PMI Final *ISM Manufacturing PMI/Jolts Job *10:30p am ELA Inventory's Wednesdays earnings: $META after hrs. and its expected to miss -Thursdays is a bit lighter on Econ data but more so with Earnings. Thursdays data: *8:30am Non-Farm Payroll Q4 *Initial Jobless Clams Thursdays earnings: *Bunch of earnings coming out so check the calendar on what ones specific to you. the biggest to not of the day will be $GOOGL, $AAPL, $F, and $AMZN. Out of all of them Looking at $AAPL as they have a buy rating on them but ya know, Follow the Waves. -As for Friday the data: *8:30am NFP for Jan *9:45am S&P Non-Manufacturing PMI for Jan *10am ISM Manufacturing PMI for Jan That's about it for that crap. As far as charts outside of following along on proper channels, all I got for levels or should I say speaking on the /ES1 open, range is $4050-$4100. Overall for short to mid term you can expect a wider range, from the upside to $4183 to the down of $3976 give or take. I am not saying either of the levels will be hit, I am saying this is the overall rage of what to expect above below $4050-$4100. Watch for follow through or rejection of Fib levels and as always follow the waves. -Ill lay out the rest of the levels and chart as I stream tonight and will be posted on the according platforms. Follow there if you like. Will be going over $SPY, $AAPL, $TSLA, $GME, $BBBY $XOM and more. If your in the community, disregard this as you will get it immediately, -Keys for the week or Wednesday I should say *One of three things can potentially happen this week. 1.Powell steps up hawkish language and comes down hard to tighten financial conditions ( chart) 2. Powell comes in hawkish but he cannot do crap about it. He cannot get more hawkish and the market its it is has been calling his bluff. (pic) 3. Powell acknowledges things have gotten much better and that odds of a soft landing have dramatically increased. Essentially approves of the rallying market and we end the year at all time highs. JKJK That's it for me. Follow along if you will and or forge your own path and create your tomorrows through your actions and habits you set today. As always, Chest to the Sun and Positive Vibes, KEEP THROWING THE STONE!!",Going back can you explain why the f*** Tesla is up 40% when the whole market is down I like Tesla but its cannot be real,0,0.53,0.935,NEGATIVE
