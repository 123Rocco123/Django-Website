,"Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities. This is a daily watchlist for trading. I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on ____?” will be ignored. News: State Street Sees Half-Point Fed Rate Cut as Soon as June DXYZ – The stock I’m most interested in today. This is a closed end fund that is investing in massive startups (OpenAI, SpaceX, Chime). Extremely short biased. ( Currently short, but very minimally). MSFT- NetEase expected to announce return of Blizzard games to Chinese market tomorrow. TLRY- Reported weak forecast, missed revenue estimates. Beverage-alchohol net revenue reose by 165% over the year-ago quarter. BB- Announces collaboration with AMD in robotics industry ALKS- Phase 1 study shows efficacy in patients with Narcolepsy Longer-term watches: NVDA/SMCI, SNOW, BA, ULTA","Are you looking at ULTA and SNOW as a bottom and want to go long, or looking at them for another leg down?",0,0.517,0.996,NEGATIVE
