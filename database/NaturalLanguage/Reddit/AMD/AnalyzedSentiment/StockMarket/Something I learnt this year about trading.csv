,"This can be a cautionary tale, or something which the analysts amongst you will help me with by criticizing my take and give advice. I started trading this year with 1000euro. I know, small sum for everyone's perspective here, but i didn't went out with a goal set to become rich. No. Not at all. I just wanted make some money I can use to take flights back home every year, without spending more than what I am investing in the market. Basically, I wanted to turn my 1000 to 1600 then take out the 600 which I'd use to buy a roundtrip. Well... My current valuation is at 623 euro. So, here is how I started... Meta was falling apart and knowing how it will DEFINITELY swing back I invest 1000 in Meta... Day one... I see the stock prices going down I started reading all about market and projections and what not and all i can understand Meta will be dead and hence I have dumped my money in wrong stock, i saw the market close in red and thought I'll cash out the next morning. And I did. I make 20 euro profit. Now I had 1018 euro cash i could use for trading i learnt how Paypal is supposed to climb up this year and did my math and realized I'd make 1400 by the end of year, i can add 200 and get my roundtrip. Well, the prices started coming down and I got afraid next day I cashed out and had 1004 in cash. Now i just wanted to learn the market and see what stocks will obviously always be going up. I bought ONE stock of tesla (before the split) and held on to it for 2 days. Tesla's quarterly was about to come out and projections said I'd make 200 in profit. The report came out and nothing moved, so i sold the stock and immediately after that the Twitter shit show began, tesla stock shot upto 1040 euro per stock which would have made me a profit of 50 euro, but i was already out. I decided, not to do this anymore, just buy something reliable and keep it. By the end of year I'll make SOMETHING... I bought Nvidia, and AMD. the last stock purchases I made. And then the market decided, not to go up even ONCE after that. I never made my roundtrip. Learn whatever you can from my mistakes. Teach me what you can if you can. I learnt to probably never trust the projections. Happy Holidays :)","normally not. Next year, with two or three beaten down high fliers, it is possible. My three picks to try to make 50 to 60% next year would be Apple, Goog, and SWK. Maybe a simi instead of SWK -- SMH ETF.",0,0.573,1.0,NEGATIVE

It is even more difficult to make 60% return, in a short time, no matter how the market does. You are right, don't believe the analyst. I think at the beginning of the year they (analysts as a whole) were projecting over a 50% return for the market this year and it has a 20%, or so, loss.The best time to get into the market is after a big down year, so your Meta, Amazon, Goog, and Apple could very well return 30 to 70%, maybe more this next year. Buy equal amounts of all four and you most likely will be up this time next year. CRM, VFC and SWK are also decent bets for next year.Another important rule is don't invest money in the stock market that you need in less than 5 to 7 years. So trying to make enough in a short time to purchase a plane ticket is most likely not going to work, more times than not. Sorry, but the stock market is a slow growth machine. The most powerful sklow growth machine over time, but slow nonetheless. Best of luck.",0,0.593,1.0,NEGATIVE
