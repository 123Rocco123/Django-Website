,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold MAG7/market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. Some stocks I post may be <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on _____?” or “Is ___ a good investment?” will be ignored or I’ll troll you unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll.

Co-founder offered to buy the rest of the company. ($7 a share). Company also gave warning of a hit from its investment in Franchise Group. Also worth watching all the random senior notes (RILYT/RILYZ/RILYB/RILYN/RILYM/RILYG, etc). LQDA - FDA granted tentative approval to company’s drug for lung disorder but did not give traditional approval. (YUTREPIA). Stock sold off as a result. Earnings today : PANW",You gotta imagine brick and mortar retails stores are hurting the most so I think EL has some ways to go before it’s a buy,0,0.517,NEGATIVE,0.967
