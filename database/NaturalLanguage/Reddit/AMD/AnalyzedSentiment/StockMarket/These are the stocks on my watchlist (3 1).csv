,"No positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers) To clarify since I've been asked: I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel: they're just my perspective of where a stock could potentially go. Percentages signify what the stock is trading at when I write up the report and are NOT predictions of stock price EOD. Some of the stocks I post are <$500M market cap and are NOT good long-term investments, but are good candidates to day trade. News: NYCB Flags Weaknesses in Loan Oversight and Names New CEO NYCB- Reported “material weaknesses” in how it tracks loan risks, stock plunged close to 25% AH yesterday. Alessandro Dinello will become CEO effective immediately. DELL- Guides 7.25 vs 7.10e per share, in addition to reporting earnings of 2.20 vs 1.73e. Stock spiked at the open, worth watching for the longer term. FSR- Reports earnings of -1.23 vs .20, with a revenue of $200M vs $333e. Pretty bad miss by Fisker, was interested in playing the bounce this morning but other than that not interested unless we either have a small squeeze or something to push upward movement. SNOW- Still looking at this as a swing trade, off the news that the CEO of the firm retired and guidance being below expectations. AMD- Broke that $180 trading range, interested in a possible short if the stock drives even higher (for example, it hits $250). Other than that will stay hands off for now.","You analisis is very interestSo ENSC could be a long term buy...I dont know FDA timing for approval, but reading your post and doing some research about Phase 3 it could be in 1 or 2 year from now, right?I see the price is pretty low now, do you think it could be lower?",0,0.548,0.547,POSITIVE
