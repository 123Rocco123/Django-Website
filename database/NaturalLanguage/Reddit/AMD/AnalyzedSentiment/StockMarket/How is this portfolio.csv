At 60 now, Here's what I've learned about investing:Investing is a marathon not a sprint. A slow & steady approach will let you take a long term approach. Don't get sucked into; get rich quick schemes, penny stocks, options/puts/calls/warrants, day trading etc. Some swear by it, but it's not for me. I have day traded, I have bought warrants and I have bought penny stocks. Some did well, some did not. The one thing they all had in common was they were all crap companies.Devise an investment plan /strategyHire a financial planner, not a stock broker, although planners (aka wealth managers) have a broker's license). (Best thing I ever did in my 30's.)Open a Roth IRA asap (If you haven't already) and max-it out every year. Currently $6,500 for 2023 or $7,500 if you're 50 or older.Do your research (otherwise, just go to a casino)DiversifyReinvest dividendsThere are no guarantees. The first stock I bought after marriage (with ""our"" money), in my 20's, was a large bank that went under. Total lost was about $900. At the time it felt catastrophic. Now (40 yrs later), I have sold stock and taken a loss of $12,000 in order to ""re-invest"" in something better.Some of my personal things when I invest:I like to invest in companies or industries that I understand such as technology. I also like the healthcare sector.I love dividend stocks (however, most companies don't pay dividends and those that do are small).I rarely (never) take investment advice in individual stocks from others because imo, they know as little or as much as I do.If I buy a stock and it's price drops, I don't dollar cost average. I'll hold it if I believe in it (long term + 12'sh months) or will hold it until I feel it's time to sell, including taking a loss and go into something ""better.""I don't make stock investments based on Financial Reseach company's buy/sell/hold b/c they tend to change based on too many factors. If I went by their ratings, I never would have bought Microsoft (entry price $30 12 yrs ago) and would have sold it at least a dozen different times).I never ""time"" the market. I have no idea when it will really go down or where the bottom is.I never ""panic sell"" when there is a major market pull back. For example, I did not sell when NASDAQ fell 30 %. It reached its high of 15,500 in Aug 21 and bottomed at 10,998 in Aug 22. Last week it reach $14,400. Many who panic sold, presumably lost a lot of money.I generally buy stocks of companies that are profitable, also those that do not have a bloated P/E ratio (price to earnings ratio) relative to others in it's sector.I hate retail stocks (and have not owned any 30 years). I hate bank stocks. I hate fads such as ""covid stocks"" like Zoom. While people made insane money on Zoom, many got slaughtered. High $478 current $71 ouch ! However, I did buy Peloton (due to some unique circumstances) at $45 and sold at $110. It reach $151 and is currently $9.27 Ouch !!I never short a stock. I don't believe in betting on a company to fail.I often remind myself to remain patient. In my 30's and 40's, lack of patience and need for instant gratification resulted in selling Apple & Google too soon and waaay waay waay too cheap.I don't believe a stock is ""too expensive"" if it's fundementals are strong, if it's an industry leader etc. I like to ask myself What would people do without this company's products Examples: Microsoft, Apple, Google.While some may be critical of my approach, I'm fine with their opinion because I don't care. My retirement account is 7 figures and I retired at 59 ! :-)Feel free to contact me with any questions.",3,0.546,0.863,NEGATIVE
