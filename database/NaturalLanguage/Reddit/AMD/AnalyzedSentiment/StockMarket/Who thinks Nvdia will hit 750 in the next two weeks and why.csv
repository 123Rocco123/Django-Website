Their quarterly reports come out 21st so what stats are you expecting to see?,"This makes the overvaluation worth the risk.Nvidia is dominant now because, until recently, they had no competition. Their stock price is based on expected growth years down the line that simply isn't possible in a fab constrained market, let alone with all the competition coming their way. AMD has the MI300X already on the market, it's significantly cheaper and rivals the H100. Intel will have Gaudi 3 later this year that's supposed to ""handily beat"" the H100, and will most likely also be significantly cheaper. Once Intel starts ramping up HVM production on 18A later this year, this will accelerate that competition, because Intel will be able to mass produce more chips on cutting edge tech that dwarfs what's currently available. TSMC won't have any new fab space until late 2025 at the very earliest, or 2026 if there are even more delays (which is likely). This isn't even accounting for the up and comers like Google (including a collab with Intel), Amazon, IBM, Meta, Broadcom, Qualcomm, etc. All are working on taking a piece of that pie, and they're willing to team up to unseat Nvidia. The days of companies writing blank checks for data center chips are coming to an end.Stock price is representative of mindshare. Once companies start to see that there is competition for a fraction of the price, either Nvidia loses those sales, or they have to cut prices to stay competitive. None of which allows them to retain their current levels of revenue.",2,0.556,0.997,NEGATIVE

There is exceeding demand for Nvidia's products, and it will expand this year. Yes, the price needs to stabilize, but even if it doesn't we aren't even halfway to the dot com share price inflation.They have ""up to"" 95% of the AI market. AMD has tried to catch up to them for many years just in gaming GPUs alone. It would take years for Nvidia to lose a substantial amount of their current percentage of the AI market.Also, last year they had 3 models of GPUs that were AI focused. This year they're releasing 7 variants (including the upcoming Huawei competitor). They are using different nodes which allows more volume to reach customers, and they're still sold out. If rumors come to fruition and they use Intel for 1 or 2 models they'll greatly accelerate production. TSMC is doubling output this year to 20%, up from last year's 10%.Keep in mind, this is only their AI product line. This isn't totaling all the products Nvidia is advancing or releasing, nor does it speak of the desktop content creator segment, gaming segment, or many other venues they use.The dot com bubble was reaching P/E ratios of 200. That isn't what's going on here. The dot com bubble was absurd and not comparable to AI market status. Comparing the PE of Nvidia to the PE of the dot com era is like comparing a $45k vehicle to a $100k vehicle. It may get that bad, but it currently isn't a valid statement. I hope the PE will calm a bit to the 60s by sometime next year, but that depends on how many people keep buying shares and pushing the price up.",5,0.565,0.988,NEGATIVE

Nvidia's hands are never idle. They're always working on something. However, even if their next products bring the heat, they're still dead in the middle of a fab constrained market, which means sales of their new products will cannibalize sales of their older products until they phase out the older products entirely. All its doing is kicking the can down the road because theres currently no way for them to scale production to sell more units. Even if they manage to stay ahead technologically against all the competition heading their way, now that there's viable alternatives on the market that offer significantly better price to performance valuations, they won't be able to enjoy these sky high margins they've seen over the last year. Either they lose sales, or they have to drop prices to stay competitive.
