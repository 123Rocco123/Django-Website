,"hello everyone, I hear more and more that INTEL is becoming less and less of a good choice for a long-term portfolio given its results in recent years and especially given the performance of its competitor AMD which has increasingly more market share, especially on desktop computer. I also wonder if INTEL, which has declining results, will or will not be able to hold its current dividend. I would like to have your opinion on this subject. Should we be worried about this stock and move away from it or not? It's too early to say? Thank you in advance for your answers !","AMD. But honestly I would avoid the chip company.

It is NOT about being miles ahead when you do not even get a chance.Apple is who decides what chips go into the phone and the Macs.It is up to Google and Amazon on what chips are used in their cloud.My point is that more and more they are just designing their own and then using TSMC to fabricate.This trend is the foreseeable future. Which is kind of weird as that is how it use to be a long time ago. I am old.I think it is unlikely they are now going to go in the opposite direction. They all now look at the chips being a competitive advantage.That is why Google did their own AI chips with the TPUs. Same with Apple doing the M2 for the Macs. Or Cruise doing their own for their self driving cars.",2,0.529,0.997,NEGATIVE

Thank you in advance for your answers !","From your article -Work on a Wi-Fi chip has been paused because Apple wants to focus its chip design resources on the advanced 3-nanometer chips that are set to power future iPhones and other devices. Kuo says that ""insufficient development resources"" are therefore delaying the mass production of not only Apple's 5G chip, but also the Wi-Fi chip.The arms race is going to be the talent to design the chips. Who can afford to spend more on R&D and talent? Someone like Aapl that is trying to vertically integrated or a company where it is a major product of theirs they sell to all their customers at volumes of many multiples of whatever Aapl buys.Aapl isn't dumb. They will do the math and decide it is cheaper overall to buy compared to investing in the design etc. Also Aapl still has to use TSMC to manufacture so Broadcom just commits to a bigger order and takes up the capacity Aapl would need.",5,0.541,1.0,NEGATIVE

The billions the govts give them is a drop in the bucket of what they need to build the fans. Intc said they are cutting at least $3B in costs on the last conference call.The bigger issue is Intc has a history of not executing. The only thing saving them is their legacy with IT managers etc. If AMD continues to take market share in BtB space and in consumer products it won't take much to tip the scale.Intc has literally been a value trap since 2000. Go look at the price, I will wait. If you bought to hold between 1999 and 2001 you are still underwater right now. Terrible investment.

TSMC + AMD = Intc if you are looking at the full supply chain from design to purchase. Amd owns the beginning of the funnel and the end, who cares that they don't actually make their own chips. Aapl doesn't actually assemble its own phones either, no one seems to care in buying their Aapl devices.The major point is Intc doesn't compare favorably to TMSC or AMD individually, let alone together. Also Intc uses TMSC to make some of their most advanced chips - https://www.eetimes.com/intel-will-rely-on-tsmc-for-its-rebound/ so comparing them to AMD is pretty fair. Intc's Fabs are not a competitive advantage. Intc does not MAKE chips for anyone else because their fabs are not current/next generation. No one cares about the steel mill, low commodity margin business. The end product takes most of the margin.Tsmc is doing well because Fabs are tens of billions each and the lead time to set them up is Years. TSMC is also the bleeding edge of technology.Intc has lost their MOJO and it doesn't matter what Pat keeps saying, I don't think they are getting it back. It would take a massive change that I don't think Intc is willing to do. Stop paying dividends, aggressively invest in R&D and people.Plan to lose money for the next 3 to 5 years to maybe get back in a leadership position.Their shareholders would rather they just keep milking their customer base as long as they can and just keep limping along.",5,0.539,1.0,NEGATIVE

That's what I believe given how much they are spending on new foundries and R&D. When it comes to competing with AMD, they will probably not catch up until H2 next year if they release their new generations in time.What to look forward to, will they release next gen chips in time? Granite rapid being the most important since it is the one that is supposed to catch up with AMD. If they succeed with that and keeps releasing according to plan their coming Diamond rapids follows, this has basically only been rumored and leaked, but it would, if it releases in time get ahead of AMD (according to rumors).In essence its a turn around case, if it works it works. Otherwise they could just adopt the businessmodel of TSMC. Let others produce their chips in their foundries.If anyone will make this happen it is their current CEO, but they can't screw up on timelines anymore, that'll bury them.There might be errors in my analysis, I'm open to discussions",0,0.552,0.911,NEGATIVE
