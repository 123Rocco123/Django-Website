,"ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot developed by startup OpenAI, based on the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) language model. It generates human-like responses to text inputs in a conversational manner. ChatGPT can do tons of things, including write and debug computer programs, compose music, teleplays, and essays; give academic/work/daily suggestions and answer follow-up questions; make a plan for specific events, etc. Basically, it can answer everything. Big Move In July 2019, Microsoft backed OpenAI with $1 billion, and the investment made Microsoft the “exclusive” provider of cloud computing services to OpenAI. Microsoft offered another investment in 2021. ChatGPT was launched as a prototype on November 30, 2022, and quickly went viral on the Internet. The chatbot signed up 1 million in the five days after its release. On January 5, 2023, OpenAI valued at $29 billion compared with little revenue. By January, ChatGPT had amassed 100 million monthly active users only two months into its launch, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history. It took TikTok nine months to reach 100 million users and Instagram two and a half years. On January 23, 2022, Microsoft announced a new multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment with OpenAI. Microsoft will deploy OpenAI’s models across its consumer and enterprise products and introduce new categories of digital experiences built on OpenAI’s technology. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Plus on February 1, 2023, starting at $20 per month. The service includes general access to ChatGPT even during peak times, faster response times and priority access to new features and improvements. Microsoft: MSFT Rating: 5/5 Microsoft announced to integrate ChatGPT into its Bing, Office and Azure service, which will significantly push the boundaries of AI and improve efficiency. The tech giant just launched ChatGPT-powered Bing and Edge on February 7, 2023. And It said that would ultimately deploy ChatGPT’s tech across its consumer and enterprise products. It is also rumored that Microsoft will let companies create their own custom versions of ChatGPT in the future. ChatGPT will surely be Microsoft’s another growth engine. Nvidia: NVDA Rating 4.5/5 ChatGPT and other language/image/video generation tools rely heavily on AI processing power, thus GPU giant Nvidia will be the top choice to invest. According to UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri, ChatGPT used 10,000 Nvidia GPUs to train the model, and it is still under-capacity following an explosion in usage and users. Nvidia will be a big winner as ChatGPT-linked tech keeps growing. Google (Or Alphabet): GOOGL Rating: 4/5 Microsoft’s new Bing will be a big threat to Google’s search dominance. And Alphabet, Google’s parent company, launched its own AI chatbot Bard just one day after Chat-Powered Bing was released. Alphabet describes the chatbot as a “launch pad for curiosity” that would help simplify complex topics. Google’s Bard will surely be a main competitor to ChatGPT.   Advanced Micro Devices: AMD Rating: 4/5 As we mentioned above, AI processing power requires tons of computing power, and AMD will surely benefit as its cutting-edge AI and data server chips welcomed by most hyperscalers. In the recent Keynote at CES 2023, CEO Lisa Su has guided that its newly launched MI300 will be able to train the language model more efficiently within weeks, against the months/ thousands of GPUs/ millions of dollars of electricity taken. As ChatGPT-related tech grows, demand for AMD’s data center product will grow further. Baidu: BIDU Rating: 3.5/5 Baidu, or China’s Google, said it would complete internal testing of a ChatGPT-style project called “Ernie Bot” in March. It said Ernie is a large AI-powered language model introduced in 2019, and has gradually grown to be able to perform tasks including language understanding, language generation, and text-to-image generation. Since ChatGPT and key Google services are not available in China, Baidu’s AI strength may help its search engine regain some market share from other competitors. Outlook: Advanced AI-powered ChatGPT can help with many redundant works, like customer service, translation tasks; content generation, data entry and processing etc. Thus, users can focus more on innovation part and improve overall efficiency. Using ChatGPT-style chatbot will surely be a common tool in the future. Still, the commercialization of ChatGPT is premature. But there will also be a customized ChatGPT sooner rather than later, which will focus more on specific industry and company needs, giving professional advice from operational and strategic levels to solve the enterprise’s problems.
