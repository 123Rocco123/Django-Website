,,There are active managers and have plenty of active mangers that have beat the market long term that’s just silly to say lol. With his current investment experience you’re right he probably should be just in indexes but you said reads as it’s impossible to beat the average market returns which simply isn’t remotely true. I know even personal retail investors that have better returns then the general market in the last 5-30 years. Buying and holding single securities you’ve done research on is fine and can yield much better returns it’s just simple risk vs reward and single companies have higher yields and more risks but if you’re will ing to do the work it isn’t bad to have some of your portfolio in them.,3,0.543,0.975,POSITIVE
,,"Yes, there are indeed managers that beat the market every year. Problem is, they are reliably not the same.

,,"It really, really depends. For me, someone who is certified in financial modeling, forecasting and valuation, building my own quantitative and fundamental algorithms to choose the right stocks to buy was not that complicated. Most of my coworkers do the same. I promise we all compound at a much better rate than 8.4% (roughly the non-inflation adjusted rate for VOO or ITOT). It's not right for everyone - in fact, active management is wrong for most since most only ever buy in a non-taxable account with a multi-decade time horizon. But for some - index investing is a death sentence - it's waiting to do what we really love to do until we are old and frail - a non-option.",5,0.519,0.999,NEGATIVE

,,"These are some of the best practices that our investor community follows:- Understand the objectives of different investment vehicles such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs rather than diving into stocks right away. Learn about risk and return, diversification, and the impact of economic factors on the market.- Define short-term and long-term financial objectives. Determine the level of risk you're comfortable with.-Diversify: Spread investments across different asset classes and sectors like healthcare/tech/mining.Minimize risk through a well-balanced portfolio.Most importantly, start simple:-Consider low-cost index funds or ETFs; it's best to avoid complex strategies until you gain experience.Good luck!",0,0.526,0.993,POSITIVE

,,"Whether the money came directly from your parents is not what's in question. Just that an average 22 year old would not have the ability to save this amount without growing up in an incredible fortunate family situation.Jealousy will exist. Not your fault. You were born where you were born. Maybe a moral obligation to comprehend our own situations so that we may better understand the situations of others and the fairness that afflicts most of the population.IDK man. I'm still trying to figure it out myself.Nice work with the savings though. I also recommend ETFs. If you anticipate similar rates of savings over the coming years, you can keep playing it a lil risky with higher yield markets. If this money is an inheritance, you may want to look at safe dividend based funds. NOBL is an ETF comprised of aristocrat dividend stocks, ie, stocks that have increased their annual dividends year over year for 25+ years.Cheers,",2,0.553,1.0,NEGATIVE
