,"$TSLA, I was excited about buying the stock, but I made the mistake of buying as the stock split happened. Similar situation with $GOOGL and $AMZN. $RIVN/$AMD/$NVDA, Bought them before the hype. Plan on selling all of my Rivans shares. $MU, I want to sell this stock, but I think it has some potential in the long term. I started investing with real money in Nov 2021 after paper-trading for a little under two years. I started investing $50 each week into stocks that did well while I was paper trading, but it didn't do so well with real money. I lost about $500 with an account that only had $1000. After a year I decided to become serious about investing and deposited more into my account each week. After about a year, I was able to gain the lost money and am now in the green. Am I doing alright for an 18-year-old? Please provide any feedback",Just keep putting money in. As time goes on I would just put 10 percent of what hits your bank account into your trading account. You barely notice it but it really adds up over time. Even if someone Zelle or venmo 5 dollars I put 50 cents into my trading account. Those look like good companies just keep holding and buying more,0,0.529,0.999,NEGATIVE

It’s used for options trading, not long term holding.",0,0.531,0.999,NEGATIVE
