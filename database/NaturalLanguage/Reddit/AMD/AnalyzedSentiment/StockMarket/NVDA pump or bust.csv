,"I would like to know everyone's opinion on this. I think even though $NVDA has like 4xed in the past year or so that they could absolutely destroy earnings and see another 10-30% gain. I am doing general research to see if I am correct but I have seen multiple articles stating how the demand for Nvidas products has increased so much that they can't make them fast enough. In this case I am speaking more to the AI compute devices although regular GPU's could share this fact. Over the past couple quarters they have seen greater %gains each time, Q4 of 14% and Q1 24 of 25%. Most of this is attributed to the recent ChatGPT boom although overall this year has been noticeably different in terms of ai hype. There are also arguments for the downside such as the bar being set so high that it may be impossible to reach and amd/intel maybe not preforming as well as they could have. On top of that not only has the market fallen but NVDA has fallen faster than the majority. I would like to say that we hit 400 and bounce (worst case 370ish??) but again I would love for people to both oppose my idea and point out things I have missed. Ty for reading シ.

The requirement for massive parallelism will not go down, it will only increase.But it makes no sense that it went from 100 to 400 this year.
