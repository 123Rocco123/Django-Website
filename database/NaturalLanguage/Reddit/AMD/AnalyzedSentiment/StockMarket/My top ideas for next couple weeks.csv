,"Best long term buying opportunity (not recommend calls but trickling in slowly as still expecting downside risk) United Healthcare - expect more downside but its stock prices have been going down while earnings have gone up. Good combination for accumulation Alibaba - harder to recommend after the recent bounce which is why it was moved from my best call idea, which is more of a short term call list, to a long term hold list Dow jones - it broke the 50 day moving average so more downside expected but itâ€™s closest to fair value compared to Nasdaq and s and p McDonald - I would have it on my call list if it wasnâ€™t for the risk of not knowing how much of the California new wage for fast food worker is built into sentiment. But good long term hold because finally valuations are getting better, dividend is decent, and people are selling the stock forgetting/ignoring that California is such a small portion of its global market Best call ideas Apple -oversold and ready for short term bounce but not a recommended medium term hold. Also good stock to trickle in slowly and be ready for lot more volatility AMD - terrible valuation and company but oversold going into earning calls. People love to buy up semiconductor stocks last couple weeks before the call. Good hedge if you want to short the tech or s and p index. Best short ideas Gold - purely technical. Way overbought Amazon - single most overvalued tech stock in the magnificent seven and thatâ€™s really saying something. Biggest risk to the short thesis is the earning call and people not wanting to sell leading into it and instead dumping after, which is why I only have a small position in Amazon in case it does sell of early but saving a big cash pile for major puts if it spikes after earning Microsoft - completely overhyped. Nothing more to say. Energy stocks (XLE) - I took some profits on my puts I bought on Friday but look for opportunity to enter shorts after small bounce. The most overbought sector in the entire s&P and oil price is unsustainable Overall statement on the conditions of the market Be very vigilant as we had into earnings call. While the market as a whole is still ridiculously overvalued, if earning calls are good enough stock market will ignore/forget the fact that they already ran up expecting the good news. I anticipate very bumpy 3 weeks. I see S and P within 1% of all time high and Nasdaq within 1.5% of all time high as excellent short entries and around 5050 on s and p and 435 on the QQQ as strategic places to place bets for short term rebound. My recommendation is to keep playing those 2 ranges until one either breaks or until after earnings call in which case itâ€™s safe to short the market to hearts content",AMZN is my biggest position. It is historically cheap in terms of price to operating cashflow. Jar Jassy Binks is working on profitability so the stock should at least get closer to median price to operating cashflow (+30%) or go way past that,0,0.545,0.547,POSITIVE
