,"I’ve been following with my investments for the last months, the current equities that I have are Amazon, Google, Visa, JP Morgan, Microsoft and of course S&P 500.

I wanted to get some opinions about some companies that people might be looking into or interested in. Thanks!","AMD is overvalued because people thinking they missed the Nvidia boat when it got over $600 a share piled onto AMD. If you want to make a AI play pick up TSM under $138 if you can. It will be $180 by years end if China doesn’t mess it up somehow. As for the others AI plays and players, I don’t see a lot of meat left on the bone. Maybe some small cap or medium cap data analytics. You’ll have to find those tickers yourself though, I’m hesitant to recommend risky tickers that have been hyped because of the AI craze.All your equities are at all time highs and the market is probably gonna go sideways or correct again by the time it starts bouncing for Q3 and Q4. Observe what happened yesterday when the market overreacted to some goon from the Midwest yacking about no and/or less rate cuts if you want an idea how much a top heavy portfolio like that can plummet in a day.Look into low valuation companies that are coming out or their expansion and acquisition stages and turning their eye toward profitability if you want to make money in the sideways market we are entering.Also, look into biopharmaceutical stocks with solid pipelines. I think this year is going to be a big year for new molecules making it to the market.Basically, the market is looking for reasons to sell off right now from what I’ve seen the past few months. Better to be positioned in something that won’t be hit as hard by a correction because it doesn’t have as much room for downside. Just my two cents and I don’t know nothing about nothing.",0,0.549,1.0,NEGATIVE

Are you projecting that price based on a major market correction?
