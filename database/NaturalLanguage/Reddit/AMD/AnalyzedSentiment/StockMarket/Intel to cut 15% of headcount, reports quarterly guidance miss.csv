,"Intel had a rough Thursday, announcing a disappointing quarterly performance and plans to cut about 15% of its workforce—around 15,000 jobs—as part of a $10 billion cost-cutting strategy. The chipmaker also slashed its fiscal fourth-quarter dividend and planned to reduce capital expenditures by over 20%. These moves come as Intel struggles to align its operations with market realities and invest in emerging AI technologies. By the Numbers: Earnings per share: 2 cents adjusted (vs. 10 cents expected) Revenue: $12.83 billion (vs. $12.94 billion expected) Year-over-year revenue change: -1% Net loss: $1.61 billion (vs. net income of $1.48 billion in the prior year) Client Computing Group revenue: $7.41 billion (+9% YoY) Data Center and AI unit revenue: $3.05 billion (-3% YoY) Stock performance YTD: -42% (S&P 500 +14%) Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger attributed the losses to accelerated investments in AI-enabled PC chips, anticipating that these will pressure margins in the near term but lead to significant market growth by 2026. Additionally, Intel's decision to shift chip wafer production from Oregon to Ireland will increase short-term costs but is expected to improve gross margins in the future. Competition has also been fierce, with rivals like AMD and Qualcomm pushing aggressively to capture market share. Despite these challenges, Intel’s PC chip division showed resilience, hitting $7.41 billion in revenue, driven by AI-friendly chips, which exceeded internal expectations. However, Intel’s Data Center and AI unit posted $3.05 billion in revenue, missing analyst expectations and reflecting ongoing struggles in the sector. For the upcoming quarter, Intel forecasts an adjusted net loss of 3 cents per share on revenue between $12.5 billion and $13.5 billion, well below analyst expectations. In other developments, Intel announced an $11 billion joint venture for a chip manufacturing plant in Ireland and launched the Xeon 6 server processors along with a Gaudi 3 AI accelerator. Gelsinger's memo to employees highlighted the need for Intel to realign its cost structure and adapt to market shifts, especially as AI becomes increasingly central to the company’s strategy. Despite these efforts, Intel's stock has tumbled 42% this year, starkly contrasting the S&P 500's nearly 14% gain. source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/01/intel-intc-q2-earnings-report-2024.html",I know someone who had a rougher Thursday,0,0.524,NEGATIVE,0.967
