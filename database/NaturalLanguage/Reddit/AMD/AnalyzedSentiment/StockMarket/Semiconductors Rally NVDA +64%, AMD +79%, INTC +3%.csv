Expected move +/-9% NVDA 2022 Q3 Financials How they stack up against one another All three companies have reported strong financial performance in recent years, driven by growing demand for their products in areas such as gaming, data center, and artificial intelligence. NVDA has been performing well due to strong demand for gaming and AI, while INTC has been struggling with the slowdown of PC sales and the delay of its 7nm products. AMD has been seeing strong growth in its Ryzen and EPYC product lines, and has been taking market share from INTC. Overall, all three companies are well-established players in the technology industry with a strong track record of innovation and financial performance. However, NVIDIA and AMD are seen as more growth-oriented companies, while Intel is seen as more of a value play. Potential trades Here are a few short term trade ideas for each of these names to allow you to capture some profit through earnings but also protect against a downward move. Least capital intensive: INTC Buy 1 $23p, Buy 1 $23.50p, Sell 3 $25.50p all expiring 2/10/23 Make 36% annualized yield unless as long as INTC stays above $25.49 at maturity (-15% move) Highest annualized yield: AMD Buy 1 $61p, Buy 3 $62p, Sell 2 $64p, Sell 3 $65p, all expiring 2/3/23 Make 63% annualized yield as long as AMD stays above $65 at maturity (-14% move) Variable (can exit early for potentially higher annualized return): NVDA Buy 1 $190c, Sell 1 $192.50c, Sell 1 $152.50p, all expiring 2/24/23 Make up to 26% annualized and only start to lose if NVDA drops below $152 at maturity (-20% move)","Okay, but I'd replace Intel with $TSM.
