,"I have around 30k€ invested in a span of last few months. Everything is in Index funds or ETFs. Basically ~50% is in IShares S&P 500 information technology ETF and the other half is spread pretty evenly on S&P 500 ETF and Asian/European/Nordic Index funds, averaging ~3k/10% in each. Used to own NVDA, AMD, some weed stocks and local essential companies like housing but I moved them all to the ETF/index funds above to minimize losses when they were all green. I think I was a little bit too late for the tech hype and I'm afraid the gains will slow down or about the next crash. I was thinking about reducing the tech by ~10k and move that to something else. Maybe healthcare? What would you suggest?",Thank you.,0,0.495,POSITIVE,0.921

Maybe healthcare? What would you suggest?","Your insight is logical, your sector weighting is very high to tech. Yes it has outperformed and still can, but adding diversity wouldn’t be a bad move. Maybe another sector etf, energy/healthcare/financials. Could easily add 2 sectors if you want.A basic S&P fund is heavily weighted to large cap tech already. So over 60% of your portfolio has all or very high exposure to tech.",0,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.999
