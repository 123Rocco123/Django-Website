,"Just two days ago, Nvidia dropped a bomb on the AI industry, igniting an already-hot field. Meanwhile, the Fed just signaled the end of a rate-hiking cycle. Together, these factors propelled Nvidia's market value beyond that of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, cementing its position as the fifth-largest publicly traded company in the United States. Overnight, Nvidia's stock rose 2.73% to $271.9, increasing its market value to $671.6 billion. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway's A-class shares fell 0.64%, decreasing its market value to $659.1 billion, allowing Nvidia to surpass it in market value. Just five months ago, it would have been a laughing matter if someone had suggested that Nvidia would surpass Berkshire Hathaway in market value. However, market sentiment has changed, the rise of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence technologies has provided strong support for Nvidia. With the development of AI technology, the demand for computing power is increasing. Nvidia's one-stop-shop approach of providing both hardware and software ecosystem puts it in a leading position globally. As a result, Nvidia's stock price has risen nearly 90% since the beginning of the year, and its increase is even higher at 136% if calculated from its low point in October last year. In comparison, Berkshire's stock price has fallen 3.4% and risen 13.4% during these two periods. If the AI boom continues, it seems that there will be no stopping the rise in Nvidia's stock price. However, some experts point out that while Nvidia has excelled in the AI race, its high valuation could be a concern. Currently, its expected P/E ratio is over 60, a level it has only reached once in the past 10 years. This has left analysts who are both bullish on Nvidia's prospects and well-versed in the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market in a bit of a bind. Analysts believe that Nvidia's business related to AIGC is almost entirely dependent on capital expenditures from global tech giants, especially Microsoft and Google. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri predicted in a report last week that AIGC could bring an additional $10-15 billion in GPU demand over the next one to two years. Based on this, analysts currently predict that Nvidia's annual revenue will exceed $46 billion in three years, with an average annual growth rate of 20% - an astonishing rate for a chip manufacturer of Nvidia's size. However, tech giants' capital expenditures in the data center space are not evenly distributed, as evidenced by disappointing results in cloud services from companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google in their earnings reports for the quarter ended December last year, with warnings that growth rates will further slow down in the current quarter. In addition, Nvidia may face increasingly fierce competition from AMD, which is launching its own data center GPU chips. Last week, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore upgraded Nvidia's rating to a buy, even though he also pointed out that its valuation had risen to extremely high levels. He said that the development of AIGC is too big of a trend to be disrupted by tactical concerns; while it may be difficult to bet on Nvidia's stock at its current level, shorting the company also seems unwise.

,"Just two days ago, Nvidia dropped a bomb on the AI industry, igniting an already-hot field. Meanwhile, the Fed just signaled the end of a rate-hiking cycle. Together, these factors propelled Nvidia's market value beyond that of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, cementing its position as the fifth-largest publicly traded company in the United States. Overnight, Nvidia's stock rose 2.73% to $271.9, increasing its market value to $671.6 billion. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway's A-class shares fell 0.64%, decreasing its market value to $659.1 billion, allowing Nvidia to surpass it in market value. Just five months ago, it would have been a laughing matter if someone had suggested that Nvidia would surpass Berkshire Hathaway in market value. However, market sentiment has changed, the rise of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence technologies has provided strong support for Nvidia. With the development of AI technology, the demand for computing power is increasing. Nvidia's one-stop-shop approach of providing both hardware and software ecosystem puts it in a leading position globally. As a result, Nvidia's stock price has risen nearly 90% since the beginning of the year, and its increase is even higher at 136% if calculated from its low point in October last year. In comparison, Berkshire's stock price has fallen 3.4% and risen 13.4% during these two periods. If the AI boom continues, it seems that there will be no stopping the rise in Nvidia's stock price. However, some experts point out that while Nvidia has excelled in the AI race, its high valuation could be a concern. Currently, its expected P/E ratio is over 60, a level it has only reached once in the past 10 years. This has left analysts who are both bullish on Nvidia's prospects and well-versed in the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market in a bit of a bind. Analysts believe that Nvidia's business related to AIGC is almost entirely dependent on capital expenditures from global tech giants, especially Microsoft and Google. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri predicted in a report last week that AIGC could bring an additional $10-15 billion in GPU demand over the next one to two years. Based on this, analysts currently predict that Nvidia's annual revenue will exceed $46 billion in three years, with an average annual growth rate of 20% - an astonishing rate for a chip manufacturer of Nvidia's size. However, tech giants' capital expenditures in the data center space are not evenly distributed, as evidenced by disappointing results in cloud services from companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google in their earnings reports for the quarter ended December last year, with warnings that growth rates will further slow down in the current quarter. In addition, Nvidia may face increasingly fierce competition from AMD, which is launching its own data center GPU chips. Last week, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore upgraded Nvidia's rating to a buy, even though he also pointed out that its valuation had risen to extremely high levels. He said that the development of AIGC is too big of a trend to be disrupted by tactical concerns; while it may be difficult to bet on Nvidia's stock at its current level, shorting the company also seems unwise.
