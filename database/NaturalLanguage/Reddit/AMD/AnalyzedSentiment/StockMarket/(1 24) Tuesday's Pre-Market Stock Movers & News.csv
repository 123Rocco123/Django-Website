,"Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to Tuesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Tuesday, January the 24th, 2023- Stock futures dip after back-to-back gains on Wall Street Stock futures dipped slightly Tuesday as investors struggled to continue a strong start to the week during a busy stretch of corporate earnings. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 100 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 futures slipped 0.3%, and Nasdaq-100 futures pulled back by 0.4%. The moves in futures comes after a solid start to the week on Wall Street. On Monday, the Nasdaq Composite led with a gain of 2.01%. The S&P 500 and Dow added 1.19% and 0.76%, respectively. It was the second straight positive day for the major averages, and all three are up in 2023. The gains have come despite an underwhelming start to earnings season and more signs that the U.S. economy is slowing, with some expected the rally to level off. “We do not see much scope for markets to rally in the near term, especially given our outlook for continued pressure on corporate profit growth,” wrote Mark Haefele, chief investment office at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a Tuesday note to clients. That’s in part because Monday’s close levels sits above the firm’s respective June and December price targets for the S&P of 3,700 and 4,000. Earnings season continues Tuesday with results from software giant Microsoft after the bell. STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: (CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!)
