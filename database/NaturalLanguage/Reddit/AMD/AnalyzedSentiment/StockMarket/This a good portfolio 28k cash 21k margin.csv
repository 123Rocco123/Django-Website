,Long term hopefully,"Because the real formula is CAGR(LETF) = CAGR(QQQ)LEVERAGE - VOL_DECAY(LEVERAGE*QQQ)The trick is that volatility is linear with respect to leverage (volatility decay is roughly to the square of leverage times underlying volatility), however returns (CAGR) is the power of leverage.

,Long term hopefully,"Imagine you have a toy car that is supposed to go twice as fast as a regular toy car when you push it. If the regular car goes 1 foot in a day, the fast car should go 2 feet, right? Now, let‚Äôs say both cars can change their speed every day depending on how hard you push them.1. On Day 1, you push both cars, and just as expected, the regular car goes 1 foot, and the fast car goes 2 feet.2. On Day 2, you push them again, but this time there‚Äôs a bit of resistance, like a small hill. The regular car goes back, losing half of what it gained, so it ends up at 0.5 feet in total. The fast car, trying to go twice as fast, ends up going back a full foot, ending up at 1 foot in total.Even though the fast car is supposed to be twice as fast every day, the up-and-down changes mean it doesn‚Äôt always end up exactly twice as far as the regular car after several days. This is because the losses hit harder when you‚Äôre moving faster (or, in investing terms, when you‚Äôre using leverage), and gains have to work harder to make up for losses.",3,0.504,1.0,NEGATIVE
,Long term hopefully,"Think of beta slippage in TQQQ like a basketball game where you're trying to dribble the ball twice as fast as your friend.If you both start at the same pace, dribbling twice as fast as your friend seems simple and in the short term works just like you want.But as the game goes on, you might get tired or lose focus, causing you to not dribble exactly twice as fast as your friend every time. Over a longer game, your performance might start to drift from your goal of dribbling twice as fast. In fact, it may require 10x the amount of rest time for you to catch your breath and get back to your previous pace. In the meantime your friend needs to rest less and starts scoring more frequently since you can‚Äôt catch up.This drifting away from your goal is similar to how beta slippage works in TQQQ over time, where its returns deteriorate the matching leveraged returns of QQQ index due to the negative compounding effect on their daily rebalance.",3,0.507,1.0,NEGATIVE

,Long term hopefully,Can you explain what margin means for me? Briefly,1,0.499,0.931,NEGATIVE
,Long term hopefully,"Margin in the stock market is like using a loan to buy more stocks than you can afford with your own money. Imagine you have $50, but you want to buy $100 worth of stocks. You can use margin to borrow the other $50 from your brokerage firm (the company that helps you buy and sell stocks) to buy the stocks you want. This can help you make more money if the stocks go up in value because you have more stocks. However, it‚Äôs also riskier because if the stocks go down in value, you still have to pay back the $50 you borrowed, plus any interest. So, using margin can be like a double-edged sword, offering the potential for higher rewards.",2,0.571,0.954,NEGATIVE
,Long term hopefully,IE you had $100 of Amazon and $50 was your money and $50 was the banks. Well say Amazon goes to $50 now you have $25 yours (which you borrowed against and the bank saw the worth) and $25 the banks but you still owe the bank $50. And a margin call is when the bank sees the stocks you own are getting close to being worth less than what you borrowed. Like if a pawn shop gave you $500 but held an object of yours worth $500 and now that object they hold lost value and is now $250. The pawn shop would freak out because they have $500 in liabilities (debt to you) and $250 in equity (the item they hold),3,0.521,1.0,NEGATIVE

,Long term hopefully,"Those are good stocks with good moats (protection against competition). The question now becomes, are they at a good price to buy? With the stock market at all time highs and those being very analyzed companies I would think not. Look back at their history lows in the past few years. Even great companies pull back and that's the time to buy. The market is holding on by a thread and there should be a major correction 15-20% in the near future (1yr).No matter how good a company is it isn't worth an infinite price. Great companies will correct you buying at too high a price but sometimes that takes a lot of years. After 2008 my index didn't get back to the same value for 8yrs. Learn how to find the intrinsic value of a company and then reduce that price by 25-50% and wait to buy at that price. Good luck!!",0,0.57,0.931,NEGATIVE
