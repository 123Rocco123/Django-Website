,"I sold my shares of AMD today and with my normal sell orders I am able to have immediate access to my buying power, however today it is pending as “Unsettled Funds”. Why was it previously available for use immediately after I sold a share, but now it is stuck pending? I use Robinhood.","I cant speak to specifics, but sometimes when you get ""instant"" access, it is actually a different feature that allows that. I have never used Robinhood so have no way to know what they do, but in Schwab they would use margin at 0% to cover my trades/transactions if I was inside t+1. But this only applies to some securities. I don't do this often, so I have not looked into it.",0,0.511,POSITIVE,0.869

I use Robinhood.","AI OverviewA good faith violation (GFV) occurs when an investor buys a security with unsettled funds and then sells it before the funds have settled: ExplanationA GFV happens when an investor doesn't make a good faith effort to deposit enough cash into their account before the settlement date. ExampleIf an investor sells 10 shares of Stock A on Day 1, and then buys and sells 10 shares of Stock B on Day 2, the sale of Stock B is a GFV because the proceeds from the sale of Stock A hadn't settled yet. Settlement periodThe settlement period for a stock trade is the trade date plus one business day (T+1). ConsequencesA GFV will remain on an account for 12 months. If an investor receives three GFVs within a 12-month period, they won't be able to use unsettled cash to buy stocks for 90 days.  ",4,0.557,NEGATIVE,1.0
