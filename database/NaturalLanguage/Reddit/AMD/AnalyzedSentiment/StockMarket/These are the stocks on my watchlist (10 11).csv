,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold some/all MAG 7 stocks and market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts. Some stocks I post may be low market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on _____?” or something answered in the watchlist will be ignored unless you add detail and your own opinion. If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you- information is meant to be shared in open discussion. I am not answering questions if I’m still long or short a stock beyond what I update. News: Musk Shows Tesla Cybercab, Sees Sub-$30,000 Cost and 2026 Production TSLA - Down 6% at time of writing, event unveiled a two-seat sedan and said production may start in 2026 and vehicle could cost less than $30,000. Presentation lacked details on whether the company will own a fleet of Cybercabs or how they would be regulated. Also showcased a “Robovan” concept that was essentially a bus. Interested in the 210 and 225 level. WFC - Reports $1.42 vs $1.27e EPS, revenue of $20.4B vs $20.4Be. Watching $60 JPM - Revenue of $43.32B vs $41.43B expected, earnings of 4.37 vs 4.01/shr. AMD - Company plans to release next gen chips for AI in second half of 2025, didn’t announce cloud computing chips as expected (which is where a lot of revenue for NVDA comes from). No new customers announced as well. DJT - It’s been on an interesting run for the past week, watching the $30 level. Likely driven by polling recently in swing states that show it being a very close race. Not based in fundamentals. IPOs I’m watching: CBLL, UPB",Atleast my DJT bags are getting a little lighter lol I had to remind myself to stick to the plan and be patient till election day.,0,0.504,NEGATIVE,0.946
