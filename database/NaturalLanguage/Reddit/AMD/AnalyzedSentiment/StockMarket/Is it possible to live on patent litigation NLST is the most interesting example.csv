,"The patent litigation process is a common occurrence in the US. According to data compiled by the Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati law firm, there are between 5,000 and 6,000 patent case filings in America every year. 95% to 97% of patent infringement lawsuits are settled out of court. Data shows that the overwhelming majority of intellectual property legal cases aren’t settled by the courts. In fact, up to 97% of patent infringement lawsuits never make it to trial. The reasons are obvious - the huge costs and the amount of time these processes take often force the parties to reach a settlement early on. Patent litigation statistics on the cost of these processes show that a settlement is always the far more affordable option The number of patent trolls who want to steal money from the big tech giants is also very high. But I want to focus on the above data. 95% of patent litigation ends in a deal before trial. This data demonstrates that companies exploit the judicial system and the costs to pay little or nothing and to continue to grow. now we're talking about a company that is having one of the biggest and most interesting patent battles in the world. Let's talk about the memory sector involving samsung, micron and google and in 2021 it saw the deal with sk hynix. NETLIST INC vs all these giants. I want to start with the last news: IRVINE, Calif., April 24, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Netlist, Inc. (OTCQB: NLST) today announced that it won a $303 million damages award against Samsung Electronics “The award resulted from a jury trial that lasted six days, and involved five Netlist patents: U.S. Patent Nos. 10,949,339, 11,016,918, 11,232,054, 8,787,060, and 9,318,160. The products found to infringe these patents were all Samsung DDR4 LRDIMM, DDR5 UDIMM, SODIMM, and RDIMM, and high bandwidth memory (HBM) 2, 2E and 3 components.” “Samsung willfully infringed those patents, and that money damages were owed to Netlist for the infringement of all five patents” And the ceo said other interesting details: “We are pleased with the outcome of this case. The jury verdict left no doubt that Samsung not only willfully infringed Netlist patents, but currently uses Netlist technology without a license on strategic products which collectively represent the future of Samsung's memory business” In a nutshell netlist inc has just won $303.15 million for only 5 patents against samsung, the judge will decide in two weeks whether to increase the damages for just cause and above all netlist and samsung will now have to negotiate IP licenses. It all seems over and yet this is just the tip of the iceberg. Samsung uses other netlist patents and there are 3 other active patent lawsuits. • One in Europe starting in September for two other European lrdimm patents. • one in delawere shared by google for patent 912 which is the best netlist patent • one in texas again for three patents, one of which is still p.912 The trial will begin on April 15, 2024. It's amazing that samsung, micron and google are continuing to carry on patent battles that they know they are losing. These giants are noxious and deserve exemplary punishment. Let's go back to the past. netlist vs sk hynix. In 2021 netlist and sk found a deal after 3 years of legal battle. Netlist has used the strategy, it has chosen to find a 40 million cash deal and $ 600 million of resale products in order to survive, having a solid partner close by and investing and marketing an innovative product of NLST, CXL hybridimm. Yes, netlist was satisfied with little money and numbers to monetize today against samsung, micron and google. It is no coincidence that the numbers of the samsung case are astounding. 7.5x the cash obtained from the sk hynix deal and this is the base damages, not counting IP licenses and potential additional damages. Netlist has invested $50 million in legal fees over the past 9 quarters. This makes you understand how much it costs to carry out justice with the difference that now netlist will start monetizing these patents which are considered pure gold. According to the expert of the samsung case in texas, ""there is no alternative to the NLST patents"" and he has demonstrated that these patents covering HBM products (chat gpt), lrdimm and DDR5 increase performance by 20/30% and above all reduce consumption of energy. Netlist is the reason samsung, micron and sk hynix make $100 million in semiconductor revenues. It is embarrassing that there are few articles from top news organizations that talk and discuss this topic. I'm not talking about netlists but in general. These giants are destroying progress and stealing because there is a failing justice system. It costs too much to sue a giant, it costs too much time and the best lawyers are paid millions of dollars Asia is exponentially increasing patents and it seems that there is more fair competition in those countries that we consider third world or very bad. Something wrong. The incredible thing is that this is just a coincidence. Netlist has 130 active patents, it is a company that is fundamental for the memory market because it covers with its patents almost all the products of the DRAM sector. Netlist invented LRDIMM, nvdimm, a core part of HBM which is one of the hottest products now, demanded by AMD, nvdia and MICROSOFT with CHATGPT. Sk hynix dominates due to having a close relationship with netlist inc. On the first comment all the dates of the samsung, micron and google trials and with DD and personal thought.","As a long term (5+ years), thank you for bringing this story to light. For so long, I have believed NLST is correct in pursuing these serial infringers but didn't know anyone is concerned. Again, thanks for looking out for ""right"" vs. ""wrong"" in the patent infringement world. NLST will prevail, be it 6 months or 2 years, but NLST will receive what is due, and the $ will be staggering to those who choose to look away.",0,0.524,0.883,POSITIVE
