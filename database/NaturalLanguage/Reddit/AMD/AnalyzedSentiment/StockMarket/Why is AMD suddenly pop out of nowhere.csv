,"I have been invested in AMD since october last year and it has been growing pretty evenely over the course of a few months. But since january it has been kind of stagnant in its growth which I guess is normal, since on their earnings call they said that this quarter is going to be a bit slow. And this thursday after several ups and downs I decided that I would sell it at the higher usual price. Little did I know, AMD experienced a surge in the price, going form 186 to nearly 200, which I will admit is not that huge, but still it is not insignificant. And my question is - why did AMD suddenly go up that much after being at around 175 for some time? I cannot find anyhting unusual going on at AMD so this came out of nowhere for me. I apologise if this post seems silly but I am just curious about this.",Dell earnings call.,0,0.578,0.934,POSITIVE
