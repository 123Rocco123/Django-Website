,"Hi all, started investing a year ago at all time highs after missing the boom and invested in Tesla, Sony, Apple, AMD, Google all at their peaks. I ended up selling almost all and now I’m down to £21,000 (that’s all my money) I’m 28m and no job, single, recently graduated. What should I do? I still have £1,300 invested between Tesla, Apple, Google and AMD. I’m thinking of selling everything and go travelling and apply for graduate jobs whilst I’m enjoying life travelling because right now I am depressed I have lost so much savings, I want to quit investing because it’s affecting my mental health seeing red everyday. I’m also living with my mom and hate living at home in England. £21k cash is all I really have and my laptop. I would love to hear everyone’s thoughts on what I should do, thanks 🙏","If loses affects your mental health maybe you should consider:a) Just quit. You can come back to investing if you feel better about it or even not come back at all.b) Going into safer investments like Treasury Bonds for example. You can also consider investing only into S&P500 etf (but that would be -20% YTD as of today).Nasdaq 100 is -33% YTD so you didn't do that extremely bad tbf.I'm just wondering why did you sell - were the losses that impactful? Apple, AMD, Google seem to be relatively safe picks.",0,0.536,1.0,NEGATIVE

If i was in your position I would start averaging into something like SCHD for example ( i think markets will be going a lot lower in Q1) and in 5-10 years I'd have more than 21k (maybe 34k).also don't worry about living at home and seeing it as a failure (a lot of people do that) and it sounds like you have a degree as well. if you are feeling depressed, take a small vacation and do some traveling for your mental health.",0,0.518,0.975,NEGATIVE

Find a job, save up, you will feel better when you see your bank account growing. During your spare time, exercise, meditate, hang out with good friends, see a therapist/doctor if you have too, take it easy, and stay invested in stock market. Life is not perfect.
