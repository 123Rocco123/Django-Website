,"Intel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me. Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play. I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint. The Fab Ahab: Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king. Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making. Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys. Hail Mary: I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade. At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders. Intel’s Fab Focus In Question: Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD. In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision. And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing. Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

I wanted to take the bull side, because I do think its undervalued, but wallstreet doesnt like companies that essentially stay flat or slow grow, they like huge growth potential, or shorting them into bankruptcy. Like take a look at Intels historical performance, even when they had x86 domination and AMD was nearing bankruptcy, wallstreet did not care. I'll probably sit on the sidelines for now until I see a good buying opportunity and then hold them for a minimum of 5 years.Now to counter points:In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1The figure I saw was Apple accounted for 3% of revenue. Not that big of a deal. However the M1 itself is concerning, it shows ARM can meet or beat x86. However its also a special situation, Apple has more money than god, and poached talent from every top semi, the more important factor though, is Apple has a cult like brand, they can convince developers to willingly create ARM versions of their apps. On the Windows side, that was an utter failure with Surface RT, and most companies are not going to want to redevelop software, external or internal for ARM, unless they are HUGELY incentivized to do so.failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nmYes, this is obviously a sore spot and still a concern going forward. 7nm is like 5 years late, its not good by any means. 10nm had bad yields and wasnt ready for prime time at launch a few years ago either. However 10nm is literally in mass production right now for Alder Lake, which is a big launch, not a niche product, this is its prime time. And I shouldnt have to explain this to people, but Intel 10nm is equivalent to TSMC 7nm, which is what AMD is currently using. 7nm was reiterated to be on track for 2023 by Pat last week during the earnings call. Intel has historically given us bad time frames, but I can only go with what is said and known. By late 2022 AMD will be on 5nm, so once again, node parity is coming.while others are working on 3nmThis is TSMC for Apple first for next year. Nobody else is at that level, There are only 3 leading edge fabs, TSMC, INTC, Samsung. Samsung being the worst of the 3 and expected to actually fall behind Intel when Intel gets to 7nm.and has even been overtaken by AMDYes, but caveats. AMD has the node advantage for similar products right now, that changes with Alder Lake (later this year), and AMD really only beats Intel in highly threaded applications, like Blender, anythings that maxes out under 8c/16t, like video games, daily use, is a wash. Credit to AMD for catching up, but its not like they are years ahead of Intel. Also this is just at the high performance end, marketshare wise, as of Q1 Intel has 80% marketshare of CPU sales, so despite their slipping high performance consumer CPUs, and some data center, they still dominate in sales.Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.Yes fabs cost money, and Intel cant exactly stay flat with revenue. Thats where IDM 2.0 comes into play. They will be designing semi-custom chips and fabbing them for whoever, they said they will open up their patents and fab whatever people want ARM, RISC-V, x86*, etc. Its entirely possible someone like Nvidia ends up using Intel fabs, since the margins are going to be better than TSMC. Its one of the reasons Nvidia went with Samsung this generation. Point is, the fabs arent be created to sit. They are expanding because they think they can grow. Also in 2025 they plan to fab lidar sensors, for mobileye, their division that is currently partnered to supply ""13 of the 15 top automotive OEMs"" BMW, Volvo, Ford, etc.Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings.I agree, but what happened happened. They made mistakes under past leadership, they missed out on supplying iPhones with chips, they botched their late to the party smartphone chips, had node issues. All we can do is judge what happens going forward, and I dont think being #2/#3 in the fab space is that bad. And until China figures things out, nobody is going to contend with the 3 leading edge fabs.That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.I think its more of 2020 and China mixed. Intel now realizes how fragile the semi industry is. Taiwan is going through a drought, tensions are high with China, Covid. One major issue and TSMC is crippled, and every company comes knocking on Intel and Samsungs door. I also wouldnt be surprised if going forward some companies hedge against possible issues and get two fabs to produce for them at once.Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap.A white flag? Intel recognizes the position they are in, they can provide the US and its allies something that none of the other leading edge fabs can. Sure they are losing to TSMC, but that doesnt mean they are heading towards failure. If they can get $50b from Biden, why wouldnt they take it? You think TSMC isnt subsidized up the ass by Taiwan? That Samsung isnt heavily tied to the South Korean government? They are all playing the same game. Intel has probably taken the least subsidies buy its government. But now they are willing to play that game to the fullest, hence why Pat is reiterating every chance he gets that stock buybacks will be suspended and that China is a big threat to Taiwan, and that Intel is national security.My very short take on why Intel could have a growth spurt in a few years:Mobileye: Like I said above, they are partnered with 13 of the top 15 car manufacturers (and even more smaller ones like NIO). People will want some form of autonomy in their future car purchases, probably more than they care about EV, but EV sales are all about tech and autonomous features really show off how modern your EV is. Tesla is doing their own thing for themselves (they once used mobileye), and Google's Waymo CEO says there current plans are to retrofit Chevy vehicles with the system.. So Mobileye is going to likely be the biggest autonomous player. Companies could jump ship, but I dont think they will or want to. Like I said before, Mobileye once used to be Tesla's AP, then allegedly the companies had a falling out when Tesla wanted use it in unsafe ways, too early in development. So Mobileye is playing it safe, and more importantly, IF there are lawsuits or issues, the finger isnt pointed at one manufacturer, and data collection will be better for training the AI. Also at some point there will absolutely be regulation to make some form of autonomy a requirement in new cars, just like airbags, backup cameras, etc. Car accidents are the #1 leading form of death in the US that isnt from a medical issue or suicide, its still a huge deal.Basically I think mobileye might grow into one of Intels biggest divisions, since from the looks of it now, they will be the brand behind most autonomous cars.IDM 2.0, This is a new take for Intel, it turns their fabs into contract services. There is money to be made both by fabbing, and by licensing IP to go into chips being fabbed. This pivots Intel from mostly being a CPU manufacture of their own products into a CPU manufacture that is also a leading edge fab for hire. This opens up the doors to things like next gen consoles, fabbing for Nvidia, fabbing for qualcomm, custom silicon combining x86 and ARM on one package for data centers, it has HUGE potential, but it depends on where the nodes are at and what customers than can acquire. This is a change that shouldve been made the moment Global foundries exited the market. Also its not like silicon demand will ever stop, it will only grow, I believe they can handily take customers away from Samsung, TSMC is another issue, but if the market is growing, they dont have to have a proposition that is able to beat TSMC, it would be great if they did, maybe they will catch up, but there is plenty money to go around. Take a look at TSMC's margins, they are healthy and only going to go up starting with this chip shortage.",0,0.539,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Intel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me. Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play. I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint. The Fab Ahab: Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king. Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making. Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys. Hail Mary: I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade. At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders. Intel’s Fab Focus In Question: Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD. In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision. And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing. Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.",ARM can meet or beat x86 performance given the software is properly translated.Who's going to pay for software devs to natively rewrite the program for ARM systems when there isn't enough demand?,1,0.529,0.997,NEGATIVE

Even without knowing its current pricing, I admittedly shouldve bought years ago. Nvidia is a great company that is simply expensive for what is right now. Also there are a ton of silicon startup companies gunning for the future of AI. Also the ARM deal has hit a brick wall. If the ARM deal goes through, yeah its a good buy. If they do end up remaining one of the big dogs in AI, again good buy, but as its stand those are pretty big unknowns.And AMD? I was one of those people that picked AMD up at $3. And I sold it for 100k profit. AMD is a great company, but again, their valuation is bad. AMD currently has 20% of the overall CPU market, even losing a bit of share in Q1. This is after 4 years of Zen, which was a godsend to them. Look at their financials and tell me that you think they are worth half of INTC, they arent.

Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders. Intel’s Fab Focus In Question: Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD. In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision. And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing. Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.",I love when I read DD and I can spot within seconds that someone has no idea what they're talking about.,0,0.507,0.981,POSITIVE
,"Intel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me. Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play. I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint. The Fab Ahab: Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king. Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making. Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys. Hail Mary: I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings.
