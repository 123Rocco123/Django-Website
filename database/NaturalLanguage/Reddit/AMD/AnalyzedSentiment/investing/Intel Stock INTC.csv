,"hi All, Can anyone provide some insight onto the Intel stock price decline over the past few months? Is the 7nm production issue such a large concern to merit such a crash? Given the relative sizes of AMD and Intel, is the market right in comparing them both? It would take IMO a really long time for AMD to catch up to the kind of revenues Intel is making. Is the market overreacting for Intel or they are pricing it right?","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

Microsoft also pushing for ARM with surface pro X 2 that can run x86-64. On top of that, AMD is now best cpu for gaming and productivity.This is just the start of a long road in a desert for Intel. They need to get smaller if they want to be able to truly innovate.",0,0.553,0.516,NEGATIVE

Is the market overreacting for Intel or they are pricing it right?","From all the articles I read about Intel semiconductor market so far, I believe this one is the most enlightening: https://www.eejournal.com/article/intel-flourish-or-flounder/Intel lost its innovative/performance edge in the cpu space and it means margins will suffer.I think they will get hit hard in the PC area in the short term.In the data center market, by having a quasi-monopoly at first, they can only lose market share by having competition now. But this space is still growing, and performance isn't everything. Apart from CPU pure performance, they are still well positioned (see article). Also, customers are much more sticky here then in the PC/Gaming area. ""No one ever got fired for buying Intel"" really does apply.The nm terminalogy is bogus. It really doesn't tell the whole story. If Intel can keep on track on their schedule this time, they aren't so far behind AMD. We'll know in december, or Q1 2021. The bad news is ARM might be a bigger threat then AMD.As a bonus, they're trying to diversify in the IOT and autonomous driving space. Two growing trend.As for the CEO being a finance guy, I don't believe it matters much for a company this big. You need the best engineers at the bottom of the pyramide that can work on generating value (not bureaucracy overhead). If it's the case, then the CEO doesn't have much direct impact. Glassdoor can tell you a bit about it: https://www.glassdoor.ca/Overview/Working-at-Intel-Corporation-EI_IE1519.11,28.htmDo you believe Intel will keep innovating, and keep up with the competition? If so, it seems undervalued. Invest for long term and collect the dividend in the meantime.",0,0.54,0.999,NEGATIVE

Is the market overreacting for Intel or they are pricing it right?","Like I said, I think ARM is a bigger issue then AMD for Intel. Apple moving to their own ARM chip is paving the way for other typical x86 platforms on the consumer market. Arm is making its way in the data center market as well.On the other side, Intel is hopefully not static, and are probably doing strategic moves also internally. Some of which we know: Trying to dig in new markets, trying to push a discret GPU line, etc. Some of which we might not know yet.And last thing: everyone says that their fabs is now a liability, now that they have lost their edge. While it might be true for now, it is also a moat. Competition relies on TSMC, which has its own risks.I’ve been buying Intel because they are cheap and can’t count them out, and TSM because all the big players (except Intel) rely on them.",2,0.557,0.997,NEGATIVE

Is the market overreacting for Intel or they are pricing it right?","Basically Intel has structural issues and they are miles behind AMD in terms of technology. Given the high costs and the time it takes to make technological leaps in the semiconductor industry, people think that Intel won't be able to catch-up, despite their huge size advantage. There also seems to be a leadership problem, as Intel is run by a investment type guy vs. Dr Lisa Su at AMD, who has a doctorate in electro engineering.The structural issues basically relate to Intel's decision to not go fabless, like AMD and NVIDIA did. This decision now leads to them falling behind technologically.",0,0.554,1.0,NEGATIVE

Its going to be at least a couple of years before Intel catch up, and AMD is most likely already on 5nm next year and Intels New desktop cpus launching in 6 months ish is still on 14nm.

Is the market overreacting for Intel or they are pricing it right?",The issue is that Intel seems to be falling behind in terms of manufacturing. Their 10nm product line is years behind schedule at this point and they are now starting to delay 7nm production while TSMC is using their 5nm process to manufacture Apple's A14 chips.The concern is that Intel's engineering department is years behind the competition at TSMC and Samsung which could mean they will never catch up and instead be forced to outsource manufacturing to TSMC.,0,0.523,1.0,NEGATIVE
