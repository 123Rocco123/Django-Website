Nvidia has marketed their raytracing for 2 years now, even changed the product line name for it. If you think raytracing in games you think RTX. The big wave of leaks around Ampere has created a huge hype for it. I dont think its smart of AMD to stay silent about RDNA2. Whats the point of trying to ""surprise"" Nvidia and the rest if everyone already upgraded to Ampere cards? The people who are willing to wait for RDNA2 with their purchase while Ampere is already available is a very small minority. You may have a different impression from browsing hardware related forums, but that's not the general market.

It’s good for us consumers that AMD might have something lined up to compete in the top-tier that will force Nvidia to price more competitively but Ampere has been ready for a while.

Pricing is completely pulled out of your fanboy ass as well as that ""a majority of people"" have made a decision if AMD for once delivers something high end competitive. Marketing is a factor that exists. Why are people buying Apple products in the first place if theyre objectively pretty overpriced?

Originally just about 15% of my portfolio it is now almost 24%. I will be holding Nvidia forever (unless black swan).The lesson I learnt is that it's important to always hold the winners of tomorrow. Whether it be TSLA vs F, AMD v INTC, AAPL vs blackberry/nokia etc.I invest in what is trending and popular versus which company is bringing in profits today.People underestimate how quickly profits can disappear when trends change.Nokia vs Apple highlights how fast fortunes disappear and new fortunes are created.(as far TSLA is concerned, even though renewable energy and EV are 100% the future, I'm thinking transportation generally will not be the future in terms of profitability. More work from home, drone deliveries etc. Unfortunately that is why I didnt bet on TSLA, in hindsight betting on TSLA instead of NVDA/ AMD/ AAPL would be yielded far greater returns)",0,0.544,0.833,NEGATIVE
