Don't you think thousands of folks believed in every bankrupt company to ever exist? Yep. They still failed.Just put 90% in index funds. Then up to 10% in whatever else you want.

Thanks for your time and input!",Index funds are great as they don't pick stocks. That is the point. They just just pick all stocks that fit their methodology. For example if you choose the U.S. total stock market it will pick EVERY U.S. stock that is investable minus the very smallest stocks (-3% or so of the smallest one out there that are too small for it to invest). They don't choose. The invest in a market cap fashion. They weigh them accordingly by market cap meaning more shares of stocks that are bigger and less in companies that are smaller. So you are gauranteed to get the return of stock market. If it gets +20% you get +20% minus fees. If it gets -20% you get _20% minus fees. That is fair.That is it. The point is to avoid active investing which is defined as: Security selection and market timing. There are landmark articles (nearly no one knows they exist including the financial pros on Reddit as I have had numerous discussion about this topic which is UBER sad considering they do this for a living) that have decided this debate many years ago. BHB and BSB papers were published years ago showing active management LOSES you money vs. passive index investing. No surprise Wall Street makes sure the main street never learns about those studies.,3,0.538,1.0,NEGATIVE

Although it can have to do with your risk appetite at some point, playing safer is the better bet as you age, especially if you don't understand markets and have professionals actively manage your portfolio, which still cuts into the profits and can do so heavily at a younger age than if you were to start early in index funds like SPY and QQQ. Saying that investing has changed over the course of the past couple of decades is true, and like you mentioned and it will be interesting to see technology influence how companies do business and how they portray themselves to the world through social media. A lot of the bigger names that we see will probably continue flourishing and lasting longer than a lot of companies that have come to maturity in the business cycle.
