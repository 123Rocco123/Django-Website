While the potential is there the revenue and profit must support stock prices unlike before.This will take more than 10 years to bear fruits. IBM already spent 10 years on AI along with $4b hardware, company acquisitions, and development effort and is still ahead of others in certain areas. But its revenue is fairly small at this point. Through its medical records trials multiple times it raised more problems than answers for physicians. I imagine insurance, search engines will benefit more initially.",0,0.548,0.999,NEGATIVE

His point is that it almost always takes 10 years from a technology being 'proved' to being a significant revenue generator and business model. He used cloud products as an example, as well as Uber. For both the technology existed 10 years before but it took a while for the business models to evolve to take advantage of it.
