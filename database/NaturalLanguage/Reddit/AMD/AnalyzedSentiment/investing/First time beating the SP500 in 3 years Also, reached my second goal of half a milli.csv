,"I started investing in November 2017 and I was doing great during the bull run. Unfortunately everything crashed down in 2021 and I spent 3 years kicking myself thinking I should've just put everything on SPY and forget it. In the last few months I can finally say that my portfolio is beating the index again. At some point during December 2022 my portfolio was -35% while in comparison if I had put it on SPY I would still be positive. This traumatized me a bit and now that I am finally beating the index over the last 7.2 years I have three main thoughts: Is the volatility worth it? I'm up on some names anything from 200-800% which makes them seem overvalued and makes me hesitate on buying more of those companies Feels like a 30%+ haircut can happen at any moment and Im just dreading when it comes. Summary: Portfolio is up 193% since inception (Nov 2017) sitting at 595K Breakdown: Tsla: 45% Pltr: 25% Btc: 17% Clpt: 6% Abcl: 3% Rest less than 5%: Beam, Clsk, Nvda, AMD, Meta I think for now im going to either lower my average on the few names im still down or just slightly up and believe strongly like Beam or Meta OR just buy SPY and turn that into Tsla BTC or Pltr only if there is a big correction in those names. BTW my strategy is mainly buying and holding. I've only sold a few companies over the years. Let me know your thoughts","Congratulations you have a great retirement/savings built up. I would personally exit a large% of your holdings and put them in a much less risky investment such as spy or even a lower risk etf which looks outside the us.Keep your plays and keep raking in the money, but insulate yourself from the ups and downs.I would put $400k into equity focused ETFs. Keep $150k for plays like you have been gambling with if you enjoy it.",0,0.51,NEGATIVE,0.983

Let me know your thoughts",Unfortunately this is not in a tax advantage account so any major selling would mean a good percentage of profits going to taxes. I do see what you are saying though so I appreciate the advice. I still have 30 years before retirement so I'm trying to balance the possibility of early retirement by stomaching wild volatility (assuming these companies do well in the long wrong of course) vs ensuring retirement at 60 by going full sp500 now,1,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.99

Let's say you have to pay 50% on your gains. You sell 400k in these stocks, let's assume that 300 of which is all profit, that's $150k lost to taxes. If instead next year pltr or multiple of these stocks drop by 30-50% quickly that 400k becomes 200k, when you sell it because you are stressed about your losses your profit is only 100k and you pay 50k in taxes.Scenario one: after tax value 250k Scenario two: after taxes value 150kYou have done well for yourself, both of these are extremes but the warning is that if you don't exit your positions which you have identified as being risky you could lose the amount you have built up.All that to say I agree that selling 400k all at once would be a mistake but you should definitely sell some before the end of the year if you want to reduce your risk.",2,0.536,NEGATIVE,0.998

Tilting in response to overall risk is another thing, I think.I close with a caution from an old guy who was invested through the dot-bubble and subsequent collapse. It took a long time for the index’s to recover, we all know that. However what is rarely discussed is how different the recovered index’s were (and are) than they were at the bubble peak. A lot of companies failed and were replaced over the years by new ones.

BTW my strategy is mainly buying and holding. I've only sold a few companies over the years.

Because he invested in stocks that performed better than ""average"". Duh.

The homie is basically saying ""yeah but beating the market is not an easy task"" which I agree but I also think picking a few better than average stocks is not that hard either and definitely not ""building a rocket"" type hard. In fact, if you're not a billionaire and you are investing your own money I think you have a huge advantage. Hedge fund need to beat the indexes every year, manage risk, AND do it with huge amounts of money. A regular ""dumb money"" investor can underperform the index every year for 5 years and then gain it all on the 6th year which I think is a big advantage",3,0.554,NEGATIVE,0.531

Over a longer period, just picking and holding a handful of stocks in the top 100 companies and holding them will have you likely beat average VOO returns",4,0.545,POSITIVE,0.952

Yeah I agree without looking at volatility all you have to do is pick one good stock and ride it out. This doesn't mean gamble in penny stocks it just means find a stock that will do at least 10% per year on average and I honestly think over the long run that's not that hard to do. The main reason I'm ""worried"" for the first time about the volatility is that I've finally crossed the line where even if I stop adding money to my portfolio I could retire by the time I'm 60. Of course the other side of the coin is that if I tolerate the risk I might be able to retire sooner",1,0.562,POSITIVE,0.919
