Thanks for your input 🫡","I know property is king however we are at the edge of “ai/digital revolution” and honestly, there is big gap between European(my case) and american rent prices-if it was around 600usd or more i would not consider selling but lets be honest here, with around 3k yearly after taxes its not anything superb-I know that stock market is NOT risk free however, it has way bigger potential to early retirement compared to one small flat with not much downside (let’s say losing 40k out of that 80k is not too much painful) over the long term, I am 31yrs old btwEdit-also consider fact that house itself is around 30-40yrs old build from times of communist regime in my country with expected life of around 40-50yrs even after revitalization I won’t expect those buildings to be here forever as literally anything can happen (sorry for bad English)",0,0.524,0.86,NEGATIVE

Thanks for your input 🫡","So let’s say you make 80k on the sale, If you were to rent at 300/month it would take roughly 22 years of rent payments to reach 80k.Now let’s look at SPY for example - it has averaged an annual return of 10% since its inception in 1993.Assuming that annual return holds, that 80k invested into SPY would be about 650k in 22 years.Not financial advice - just math",2,0.522,1.0,NEGATIVE

Thanks for your input 🫡","You did not count the price increase/decrease which is ? however prices went up basically 100% since Covid which is brutal and that’s why I am considering selling it as I’ve purchased other flat with mortgage for 1.3mil crowns(including reconstruction) and now it’s real value is +1 / +1.2 mil crowns within just 3 years, which in itself is a very decent return but yeah I see what you mean and I might consider this path too, thanks for an input ! 🫡",3,0.522,0.98,NEGATIVE
