,"In every speech I hear JPOW say ""shortages of semiconductors"". China is the biggest producer of silicon in the world at 64%. Silicon is the most important raw material in the production of semiconductors. China cut production in Shanghai by 90% from 71,000 mt (metric ton) month to 7,000 mt month. 2020 - 578,000 mt to 2021 - 277,000 mt. China alone has driven the price of semiconductors up by 300%. Furthermore: it takes 11-13 weeks to make 1 semiconductor, start to finish after its designed and sent to production. With AAPL and TSLA both needing semiconductors. I don't see them having enough raw material to produce for demand. This is not supply chain issues. This is China wanting to take over the industry and trying to have SMIC catch up to TMSC and Intel. I don't think anyone can catch ASML. With tech sector holding the highest weight on sp500 @28%. If 28% of the market is down not including all the other products that use silicon.

,"In every speech I hear JPOW say ""shortages of semiconductors"". China is the biggest producer of silicon in the world at 64%. Silicon is the most important raw material in the production of semiconductors. China cut production in Shanghai by 90% from 71,000 mt (metric ton) month to 7,000 mt month. 2020 - 578,000 mt to 2021 - 277,000 mt. China alone has driven the price of semiconductors up by 300%. Furthermore: it takes 11-13 weeks to make 1 semiconductor, start to finish after its designed and sent to production. With AAPL and TSLA both needing semiconductors. I don't see them having enough raw material to produce for demand. This is not supply chain issues. This is China wanting to take over the industry and trying to have SMIC catch up to TMSC and Intel.

The majority of the wafer cost is based on the depreciation of the fabrication equipment. Even if China was supplying high purity wafers, a 300% increase in virgin wafer cost would likely only have a marginal impact on final die costs.",0,0.535,0.997,NEGATIVE
