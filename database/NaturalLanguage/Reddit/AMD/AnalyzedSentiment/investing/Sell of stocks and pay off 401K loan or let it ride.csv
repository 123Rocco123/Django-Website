He is paying back the total in addition to the capital it would have earned over that period as interest (it's likely not reasonable, especially if the loan is a couple years old, but... that takes me to the next point).You are wrong twice, because that money is still in the market today. Because a 401k does not tax advantage earnings, there is not a ton of functional difference in which account is tied to the money while it's invested (not true for roth).In my opinion - There's a good chance he sells safe shares, pays himself back, and dumps those same dollars right back into those safe shares through an ETF in his 401k.The only difference is now it's harder for him to touch it, since it's back in the 401k.",1,0.539,1.0,NEGATIVE

Assuming that market returns are more important in value than a remodel is an ASSumption. You might be right, you might be wrong. In either case - that wasn't the question you got asked.The question you got asked was: Given that funds are in the market anyways, is it worth moving them back into the 401k early? And the answer is clearly: ""meh"". It does not matter a ton at this point.In almost every case - moving the funds back into the 401k at this point is mostly a no-op. In the best case, it prevents OP from touching them for spurious purchases, in the worst case - it drastically reduces flexibility of that money.In both cases - it is earning market returns. In both cases - it will be taxed equivalently. The 401k will likely have a worse selection of funds, and is much harder to touch.So you are fundamentally wrong in your answer to the question asked. You are technically correct that he lost money in the market by purchasing a thing (heavens forbid, someone is using their money? stop the presses!) but not in a way that is helpful. If anything, you just made a lot of assumptions that OP is a fool and gave an incredibly unhelpful answer.",3,0.52,1.0,NEGATIVE

Home improvement and renovation being a perfect example.I have a *serious* problem with a lot of the accounts in here that just immediately start bashing folks for attempting to use money (any money, for any reason, with no thought or consideration).Money is a tool - leveraging that tool through a 401k is only one way to apply it, and sometimes there are more impactful and meaningful ways to do so.A prime example: Renovating and improving the area you literally live in every day.That's got ridiculously high returns on input. It immediately improves your life and it improves the resale value of your home. Spending 401k cash on that is almost certainly a better call then letting it sit in the market (almost - you can do a shitty reno).I can fucking quote the fidelity 401k page here (https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/financial-basics/taking-money-from-401k):""Another potentially positive way to use a 401(k) loan is to fund major home improvement projects that raise the value of your property enough to offset the fact that you are paying the loan back with after-tax money, as well as any foregone retirement savings.""I'm not in here giving unusual advice. I'm in here giving the practical advice that most everyone who is not an internet ""investor"" will give you.You can't take your pile of cash with you when you die - you should not be trying to hoard it until then.",3,0.528,0.766,NEGATIVE

While you aren’t technically losing money, you are missing out on the profit (or loss) of that money over the payback period of the loan. The interest you’re paying yourself will likely be less than the growth rate of those stocks over the payback period. For that reason, I wouldn’t sell more stocks to pay off the loan quicker, as they may be growing at a faster rate than you are paying yourself interest. I would just pay it back on time and not borrow from it again",0,0.532,1.0,NEGATIVE

I would not have recommended drawing from a 401k for a home remodel in the first place, but it might have been the right call for OP in his situation.At *THIS* point, though - the money is back in the market. It's not a Roth 401k, so earnings aren't tax advantaged in the 401k. So there is basically no difference which accounts it sits in from an earnings perspective.As long as he continued contributing to the 401k while taking the loan, he didn't even lose anything in the way of tax benefits here. He just lost a bit of time in the market for some cash which he had a reasonable use for.Right now - unless he wants the mental comfort of not having to deal with this complexity, I would pay the 401k loan on time but not early. It gives him more flexibility and has no impact in earnings (he might use that flexibility to impact earnings - but that's a different conversation)",1,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE
