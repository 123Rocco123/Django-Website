,"Last month, JEDEC published the official standards for DDR5, which are the standards for which all next gen DRAM will follow for PC/Servers (note: laptop/mobile devices use a different standard and I don't think corsair has anything to do with that industry). DDR5 offers double the speed and less power consumption than the current standards, DDR4. It currently looks like intel will start offering support for DDR5 in the middle of 2021 and AMD will follow in 2022. At that point, we can expect to see a mass wave of upgrades among high performance PC and server users, and Corsair is a big player in that industry. We don't know anything about the IPO details yet, other than they're looking to raise $100M. That said, with a reasonable valuation this could be a good option to jump on if you're looking for a 3-5 year hold.","As usual DDR5 will probably be slower then performance DDR4 modules (in terms of throughput = speed / latency) same as DDR2/DDR3/DDR4 when it first came out. It offers much higher speed, but much higher latency until everyone gets stuff sorted out. Not worth upgrading unless you just like to stay on the cutting edge, AND as with any new technology, price will be ridiculous for the first year.Also Corsair is very highly diversified, although information is not public, i would say no more then 15-20% of their revenue (profit even less so, since they dont manufacture, just package and resell other modules) comes from RAM. They sell keyboards, mice, headsets, other streaming gear, power supplies, computer cases, etc. Each of those is highly competitive field in which there are many players.Might be a good IPO play but i dont see much of a long term hold unless Im missing something here.",0,0.533,1.0,NEGATIVE

I'm not sure what their IPO roadmap strategy really is but it's not something where i'd say I'm getting in at the bottom before an explosive growth. I think relative to all the other tech stocks the fact that Corsair will be selling DDR5 ram along with everyone else doesn't do much for me.I'd wager they are simply doing this to have greater purchasing power for high volume taiwanese manufactured parts, that they cannot practically fundraise for privately. They will become a more ubiquitous brand name in PC peripherals and components (like logitech).I made a move away from Corsair to Razer this year for my keyboard, mouse, and LED management, and I personally feel that razer has much higher quality software and hardware. I can't imagine Corsair's quality improving post-IPO because that usually does not happen. IPO usually goes high volume and cheaper.",1,0.537,0.997,NEGATIVE

Still, 4800 MHz is fast enough to rival the best DDR4 hardware on the market.

At that point, we can expect to see a mass wave of upgrades among high performance PC and server users, and Corsair is a big player in that industry. We don't know anything about the IPO details yet, other than they're looking to raise $100M. That said, with a reasonable valuation this could be a good option to jump on if you're looking for a 3-5 year hold.","Consoles have been around for more than two decades yet PC gaming today is more popular than ever. Consoles usually have a life cycle of around 4-5 years. In the very beginning after launch Consoles have an edge over PCs but PCs keep getting better all the time while console remains static. The new PS5 may beat PC graphics until the next gen NVIDIA 3000 series graphics cards come out and then PCs will have the edge again. Also people buy PCs and then upgrade them as new better parts are released. So while initially when consoles hit the market, PC sales may see a slight dip, PC component sales have a steady market as new products keep being released all the time with ever new generation of CPU and GPU released every year.",1,0.572,0.992,POSITIVE
,"Last month, JEDEC published the official standards for DDR5, which are the standards for which all next gen DRAM will follow for PC/Servers (note: laptop/mobile devices use a different standard and I don't think corsair has anything to do with that industry). DDR5 offers double the speed and less power consumption than the current standards, DDR4. It currently looks like intel will start offering support for DDR5 in the middle of 2021 and AMD will follow in 2022.

PC gaming market is increasing rapidly and is more obtainable to the average consumer than ever. Will continue in the future. Consoles are dead. Corsair has $1.2 billion in revenue for the first 6 months and yet the company is currently only valued at $100m. We don't know their profits, but already sounds promising to me.
