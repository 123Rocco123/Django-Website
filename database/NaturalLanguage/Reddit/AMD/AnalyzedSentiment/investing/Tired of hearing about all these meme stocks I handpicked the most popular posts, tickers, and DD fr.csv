Now we have NIO, PLTR and BB.I wouldn't call any of these long-term at this point. Perhaps 10 years from now we could evaluate that thesis, but 3-4 years max in an unprecedented liquidity driven market does not really prove much aside from the fact that risky assets seeing the greatest alpha when central banks push investors out the risk curve.If the thesis here is ""buy profitless companies that have an interesting story when we see waves of liquidity entering the market"", then you're 100% spot on, or at least that's what the recent history has shown us.A large component of the stock market is based off of psychology and feeling.100%. But this is a method of trading, and once that psychology fades, those stocks tend to mean revert. So unless you're adopting a trading system based on popular pyschology and flows for these types of stocks, It's NOT the type of process you should use for a longer term investing strategy. Ideally, for a long term investing strategy, you would want to find something that works out across different macro regimes / recession periods. As the old adage goes, markets in the short term are a voting machine, but in the long run tend to be weighing machines where true fundamentals actually matter. IE, cashflows, competition, moats, debts, liquidity ratios, etc.You need to find an undervalued stock that actually has a compelling story that the mass public will jump on as well.Correct, albeit, how are you defining undervalued for any of these? I don't see a single stock mentioned here that would be viewed as undervalued by any value metric. Either way, lets not conflate trading and riding a wave of liquidity amidst somewhat unprecedented risk taking with ""fundamentals"". And that's not even an argument to say that these companies are doing anything wrong. They have generated great sales growth, they have raised capital, and they have grown significantly. But they're all still priced for perfection in a lot of ways. I'm not trying to be stingey here, I've made a buck or two on some of these, but I just hope people understand that a gigantic portion of the success of these companies is more owed to the macro regime that allows for these types of companies to see enormous growth in share price more than anything else. If that macro regime shifts, there is a very real chance that the exact opposite will occur of what happened over the last 3 years.As for the strategy, this is what worked in the last 1-2 years, which have been extremely unique times. That doeesn't mean it's what ""works"" as a general rule of thumb, and the more that people think this is the norm, the more they're bound to get burned in the long run by learning the wrong lessons.",2,0.536,0.99,NEGATIVE

Neither deserve the kind of valuations they were being priced at. AMC has been CLOSED! GameStop near bankruptcy, & its' brick-&-mortar operations were under SERIOUS threat before PokemonGo came along & kinda revived them for awhile! Like BLOCKBUSTERS they were on-their-way to becoming a relic.These medical companies have million & billion dollar products in the pipeline. They can RUN MUCH harder, faster & longer. It all depends on how things with the FDA fall, their drug trials, approvals, fast-tracking & the like. If the drugs work, which they've shown HUGE PROMISE in trials so far, then SMMT might be another Pharmalytics. CEO Duggan ran Pharmalytics into a VERY LUCRATIVE buyout. He made MILLIONAIRES out of shareholders,.... & pocketed a RECORD $3.5B himself. He looks POISED to do the same thing here AGAIN. He has the SAME COO & staff & he holds about 50% of the available shares. That's important because he could get TOP PAY & just take millions in salary. Remember, he's a proven entity,... he's done this BEFORE. Instead, he has decided to TAKE NO PAY & GET SHARES ONLY! Why? Well, he wants the bigger payout!Other insiders, investment bankers, etc., seem to be holding another ~25% (heavy hitters ALL in support of this stock & anticipating ANOTHER success like Pharmalytics), which leaves a paltry float: I think the float is like 18mm here. Which is less than the OS of SAVE...So this could run hard & fast. SAVA had ~26mm shares out (I think) & they ran to $120.00And NONE of this includes reddit engagement, support, pumping & folks feeling like it's their PERSONAL MISSION to run this stock! If that happens who knows where this goes. My earlier point was GME & AMC are hardly viable, legit, new ventures with world's of promise; they both operate in a VERY MATURE business & market: Movies & Gaming!Whereas SMMT solves life & death, quality of life issues, & is a biosciences disruptor: If Duggan repeats his success with $SMMT the stock could easily break $50 on it's way to $200 (based on same move, lower float).But I guess we'll have to be a bit patient, wait & see,... ITM I'm just going to add each dip. I have 8k so far & want to grab AT LEAST before it gets past $15. If, for some reason there's ANY KIND of odd sell-off I hope to accumulate 20k. That'd be a $2mm payout if it reaches a hundo! Not bad at all for a stock trading at $11 right? But I think the KEY here is proven management, insider holdings, & the experience to EXECUTE! Remember, Duggan is foregoing A HUGE SALARY (which no one would begrudge him taking) in lieu of SHARES! And it's always WISE to align your money with experienced management (who keep accumulating shares) & are betting on themselves! I think we have a WINNER here.",2,0.527,0.995,NEGATIVE
