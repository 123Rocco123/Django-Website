,"I ask because of AMD. AMD acquired Xilinx in an all-stock, no-cash deal, but they now have to depreciate the cost of that purchase over 20 years. This gives them atrocious earnings, an EPS of 0.69, and a P/E of 243. If you look at their non-GAAP EBITDA (which they call out in their financial reports), the picture is much rosier. Which one matters more when evaluating their performance? I may have some misconceptions in the facts I stated above, so please feel free to correct my thinking.","I think you somewhat have to look at it on a case by case basis , it is a metric for companies earnings but it excludes the cost of capital (debt) and taxes what are very real thingsOthers will say it make sense to exclude non-cash expenses like depreciation however if a company needs to make large cap ex purchases to stay competive it doesn't make sense to just ignore thoseHowever even buffit who sort of called EBITA bullshit did say ignorning ""good will"" depreciation is somewhat valid even bershire would release non-gaap earnings that excluded good will depreciation as its a ""non-cash"" expenseSo I do think there can be two different cases like the followingCompany A has 100 million EBITA, however they borrowed a bunch of money from banks or issued bonds and they have to pay $100 million in interest payments making their earnings zero. Well interest is a very real expense you just cannot ignore interest and it HAS to be paid or the company goes into bankruptcy and creditors can sieze the companyCompany B has 100 million EBITA but also has 100 million of ""good will"" depreciation because it purchased a few companies in the past years and has higher good will depreciation making earnings almost zeroThose two companies have the same EBITA earnings but most would argue are in very different situations , with company A you just cannot ignore interest its required to pay each year and interest is a very real ""cash"" expenseCompany B is just depreciating good will what one could make the case is not exactly the same as interest payments its just accounting to make purchasing a company that has 5 billion in assets but you purchase it for 8 billion so you need to account that extra 3 billion somewhere then depreciate it down .",0,0.558,1.0,NEGATIVE
