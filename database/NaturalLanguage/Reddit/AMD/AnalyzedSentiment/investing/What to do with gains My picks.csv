,"It seems like tax laws are going change soon. I am up close to 200%, and am thinking about taking 30-50% off the table prior to the new year to avoid massive taxes that seem to be imminent regardless of presidents, and more likely because we are going to have to pay back our debts at some point. However I am making 3-5% gains almost every day and I dont want to do something stupid if taxes don't end up being that different after all. I understand how general tax laws work regarding hold times and wash sale. More looking for peoples thoughts on how bad things may or may not be in the next 6-24 months, which is my timeline for the 7 largest positions I have. Ill list them, and explain why I have them MVIS- 500 shares at $1.8 UBNT 30 shares at $40 WKHS - 100 shares at $16 CMBM - 160 Shares at $15 NRZ - 200 Shares at $7 CEQP - 100 shares at $12 VLDR -40 Shares at 15 I work in TELCO and Lidar is changing the way we do mapping and making life 100x easier. VLDR is a company that was mentioned by a supplier and I heard good things about them. MVIS has a ton of patents for lidar, and the buy out rumors have been coming and going for a few cycles now. I've traded in and out quite a few times and made decent money on options. If the BO rumors are true this time, which seems likely given the EV and SDC mania, I think 10-15 is easily attainable. If a bidding war happens who knows. UI makes our radio gear. The CEO used to work for Apple, and basically flipped them the finger amd bootstrapped ubnt on his own. If you listen to the earnings call after the Citron report you will understand why I love him. He told an analyst to go research his company before asking stupid questions, while his company sp was tanking due to a major hit job. Then he stopped getting on the calls all together because he ""didn't have time for the circus and had a company to run"". Then took it on a 400% rocket ride. They have both netowkr and wifi hardware and we currently run about 700 customers almost exclusively on UI gear inside and outside the home. Their price point is unbeatable for performance, but there is a definite ceiling for the time being on the performance capacity. CMBM is like UI smarter and more responsible older brother. We just started using their products and they are amazing. They have inked some huge deals and their engineering and support are worlds better than UI. I missed my chance to load the boat on UI at this price in 2016. I fully expect CMBM to follow a similar trajectory. See my profile for more in depth DD here. I bought 2x WKHS 2.5 calls for 10c each right before it exploded to $19. Sold at 21 and bought back in at 16. Its a spec play because I know nothing about them past whats available to everyone here. NRZ was a bad divi play that I averaged down on. Its been slow to make a full recovery, but has recently been posting good numbers. CEQP is one of the last Oil stocks I follow to make moves toward normalization. The divi stayed strong through covid and I think it has a solid chance to track back toward 30$ UAVS is another one I just bought. They make smart farm drones. My county just got a 2mil dollar grant in association with several other counties to develope ag tech solutions to deal with the ever aging farmer problem. AG tech, imo, is going to be the next EV boom. There are very few companies in the market, relatively speaking, and most of them are offshoots of large corporations. To my knowledge there hasn't been a big entrepreneur boom here because the money wasn't flowing, but with covid wreaking havoc on the food supply farmers here are scrambling for ways to cut cost and there aren't many. And there aren't many ways to do so at this time. However smart field maintenence kills two birds with one stone. More efficiently managed fields have better yields, and smart fields will consume less water, Nd require less pesticides because the application will be target specific vs mass application methods that are required today. Use case- drone flies over field and identifies all suspected weeds, sprayers can locate weeds quickly, preventing spread thus lowering application amount, lowers labor costs due to not having to search for weeds. Drone identifies over/under watered sections of field. Adjusts sprinkler flow accordingly saving money and water. Makes greenies and capitalists happy.","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

I’m always tempted to secure my initial investment, but I know as soon as I do or try to swing is when the BO news will inevitably happen. I’m also happy with my shares of nrz, but I averaged up to around 5..the dividend has been getting better too. The talks about changes to taxes make me a bit uneasy, but I’m in a pretty low bracket, and also got my fair share of loss to even some of it out. I only got into mvis in may, so hopefully it has time to mature by the time I want to sell.",0,0.527,0.683,NEGATIVE

Yes, I've had tax attorneys argue with me non-stop about taking losses at end of year (and waiting to clear wash sale). And it's my money so I always win the argument. My perspective has always been - if I'm paying taxes that means I am making money, so I pay what I'm required to pay. Locking in gains is not a bad strategy either, so if you feel you have some winners that are done winning, then it might be a good time to lock in the gains. But today I watch QS go ballistic on news, a stock I sold for a mighty profit that as I type this has now almost doubled from the level I sold it at (which was 4 times what I paid). Sucks, but my analysis reflected that the price I sold was so far beyond future P/S based on 2025 potential sales... sometimes runners run. You cannot predict the future so do the best you can with the information you have available at the time, learn from any mistakes you make. If it is a trade, then be prepared to trade it. If you are investing, then buy companies you believe in and let them run.",0,0.545,0.998,NEGATIVE
