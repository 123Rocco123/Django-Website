,"Which do you prefer, and are there any other reliable investment options to grow wealth? Currently my portfolio is spread somewhat evenly across all 4 of these options. Here's some random thoughts of mine from my investing journey since 2017. REIT I really like REITs because of the monthly dividend. There's just something about buying something and having it payout each month that is very desirable to me. Even knowing the returns will never be that of an individual stock win, I just really like the concept and consistency of the REIT. I'm tempted to dump 50% of my investments into REIT for this reason alone. Stocks As the old adage goes; Never buy an asset you don't understand. I figure that you should only buy a stock if you have a good reason, and I don't have much interest researching companies to try and find a good pick, though my mind could be changed on this if someone convinces me it's worth it. I work in tech so I have a decent understanding of what tech companies do and I've had a few winners that I bought with some foresight. I bought AMD at $30 when I saw that Intel was releasing inferior processors at higher cost and trying to prevent hardware reviewers from reviewing them. I bought COIN near its bottom when I saw their stability in the wake of the crypto exchange disasters, and knowing a halving event is on the horizon (verdict is still out on this buy of course). Other stocks like ABBV have done well for me over the years, but I have absolutely no idea why because I know little about the healthcare industry. I lost some money on ABNB, and again I couldn't tell you why because I've never researched this company. I bought the stock a while back because I thought that ABNB would obsolete hotels. On a long enough timeline, the value of any individual stock will fall to zero. So the question is, when do you sell? Seems to me that playing the individual stock game requires consistent ""maintenance"" and I wonder if it is worth the effort. Also how much effort is worth spending on statistical analysis like P/E, market cap, volume etc.. ? ETF Safe and reliable. But it seems like everyone is buying these nowadays and recommending that you buy them. I've had VOO and SCHD as my main investments for a while now, and they seem to do well. but I can't help but wonder, If you do what everyone else is doing, how could you ever hope to perform above average? Or does it simply come down to the fact that if you are putting more into the market than the average person, you'll come out ahead with an 'average' return? Is it possible for some kind of ETF apocalypse to happen where the market stagnates due to extreme diversification? Robo-investing On march of 2022, in the wake of the insane COVID stimulus rally, I came to the conclusion that I had no idea how to understand the market and decided to switch to Betterment. I set the risk to 'max' and started putting 50% of my investment money into Betterment and the remaining 50% into my personal brokerage split between stocks, ETF and REIT. Since then it's gotten me a 5.2% actual return with IRR at 11.2% This investment vehicle doesn't seem much different that just buying some ETF myself, but maybe there is some happy middle-ground between overly-managed (stocks or human managed funds) and unmanaged (ETF) funds? A major thorn in my side has been trying to understand foreign stocks vs US. Apparently there is an undulation where the U.S outperforms the rest of the world for several decades, followed by underperformance. I've bought some foreign stock ETFs but these have done poorly next to US companies. Betterment handles this automatically so I figure it's good to get some exposure here. Conclusion? Aside from derivatives and betting on crypto or individual stocks, the investment world seems like a homogeneous bowl of diversified funds. I'm kind of bored of investing and really just do it because I don't know how else to grow wealth aside from trying to get into real-estate.","REIT - I have 2 REIT stocks in my portfolio. One pays monthly and the other is quarterlyBanking stocks - I have a foreign bank stock that pays whenever they feel like it seems for dividends payouts. Banking financial statements are confusing to me and are unlike financial statements for companies selling productsStocks and investing in general - you should have goals and then research companies based on your goals. Rather than picking stocks based on what is hype today look for stocks that meet a goal or personal preference. I look for high paying dividend stocks trading at a discount but I also want them to have a lot of cash or cash equivalents so they can pay off their debts in a crisis. You have to read, understand, and analyze financial statements to do this kind of research. I also do research to mitigate risk. How I invest as a retail investor is based on mitigating risk. I avoid option and forex trading to mitigate the risk of those investments.ETF - I tend to avoid hype investing and since everyone is doing it I don't want to get into it at this timeBetterment - don't know much about it. Looks like ETF trading which I'm not much intoHave you tried Acorns at all? I use it as a short-term cash flow vehicle.I also like the Ronco way if investing. Set it and forget it. You setup automatic trades and then let it invest and reinvest the dividends automatically. Check back on it once in a while.",0,0.536,0.988,NEGATIVE

I pretty much hate 401k's and investment funds for this reason, but it's even worse since you also have to ask permission to do anything with these funds and cannot withdrawal without a penalty. The way I see it, if you have to ask permission to touch your money, it's not really yours.I'm doing set and forget right now, which is why I've been looking at REITs and dividend investments. My main issue is doing set and forget with a stock, but yeah maybe a little more technical analysis is what I need to do.",1,0.531,1.0,NEGATIVE
