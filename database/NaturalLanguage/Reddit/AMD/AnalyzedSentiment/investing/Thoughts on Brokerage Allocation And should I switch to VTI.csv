,"I’m 23 and have around 15,000$ invested in my brokerage, with a mixture of SCHG, SMH, AVUV and XMHQ. I have maxed my Roth the last two years and have 100% of that in FXAIX. I am planning on going 100% FXAIX for at least another three decades but am beginning to question my brokerage allocations. I purchased those ETFs when I was fairly new to understanding the market and now that I have a better understanding, I have been drawn more and more to just doing VTI. I am particularly feeling regretful for having such a high allocation in SMH since SCHG already has a high percentage of NVDA and of course includes other semi related stocks like AVGO and AMD. If I could have advice on what to keep, drop, etc, I would like to do it now while I’m young so I’m not tempted to do it in the future.","You're essentially asking the fundamental question leading to the debate that has been raging between bogleheads and stock pickers for decades.There are reasonable arguments on both sides, but I will say that for MOST people, you will have far better returns with near zero effort long term if you just buy the indexes.If you have some reason to believe you have an information or research edge over the rest of the market, go for it, but very few people actually do and it takes a lot of work.If you don't though, you should have 3 funds. VTI or S&P 500 fund (FXAIX is fine and falls under this category), bond fund, international stock index fund. Bonds should be very low or non existent at your age and slowly make up more of the portfolio as you get close to retirement, and balance between international and domestic is largely preference.So something like 15% VEU, 85% VTI wouldn't be unreasonable. Anything up to around 35% VEU would be fine. No international stock at all and only VTI is also reasonable.",0,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.999

Obv higher risk/reward in single stocks, but you can still find some higher risk funds/etfs and diversify that way, rather than diversifying between something like VMI and those single stocks.If you have enough time to keep up with it, 1/3’s has been my flow. Think it’s a good time to put in 1/3 of what want to own over all. If it dips 3-5%. Another 1/3. Etc. IF- I like it long.If you don’t have the time and want to just let it sit, find 3 funds/etfs and diversify that way, buying every two weeks/monthly. VMI, high risk, low risk.",0,0.522,POSITIVE,0.736
