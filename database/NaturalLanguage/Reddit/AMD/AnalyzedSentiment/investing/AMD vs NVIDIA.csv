Their combined expertise, supported by a rich ecosystem of partners, will meet the challenge of surging global demand for consumer internet services, and the application of AI and accelerated data science from cloud to edge to robotics.By acquiring Cumulus Networks, NVIDIA can innovate and optimize across the entire networking stack from chips and systems to software including analytics like Cumulus NetQ, delivering great performance and value to customers. This open networking platform is extensible and allows enterprise and cloud-scale data centers full control over their operations. Cumulus, supports more than 100 hardware platforms with Cumulus Linux, its operating system for network switches. Their ultrafast NVIDIA Mellanox Spectrum switches already ship with Cumulus Linux and SONiC, the open source offering forged in Microsoft’s Azure cloud and managed by the Open Compute Project.Simon Segars and his team at Arm have built an extraordinary company that is contributing to nearly every technology market in the world. Uniting NVIDIA’s AI computing capabilities with the vast ecosystem of Arm’s CPU, they can advance computing from the cloud, smartphones, PCs, self-driving cars and robotics, to edge IoT, and expand AI computing to every corner of the globe.",0,0.545,1.0,POSITIVE

But whatever.Think it’ll depend on how AMDs cards do and if they’ll stand any chance against the 3080s. But I’m a retail investor and by no means an expert. So should prob go with nvidia lol,0,0.532,0.993,NEGATIVE

He brought on a semiconductor analyst for today's video and they had some discussions on AMD and the market. I think the whole thing is worth a listen, but 46 minutes in they start discussing AMD's ability to gain market share. A big issue for AMD is if they can gain CPU market share for servers. Right now they are around 5% market share on server CPUs. But getting your CPU's in servers is where a lot of profit comes in. If AMD gets that number up to 15% it starts to cause problems for Intel.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLTP-6tK8U",0,0.57,0.999,NEGATIVE

But nvda is exposed to a lot of growth markets though. If arm doesn't cause too much trouble I think they'll outperform.Amd had a nice run but will have a hard time attracting attention in the short term since they present their earnings on election day. Amd is priced for perfection and has to keep up, if they loose their momentum they need another leap in tech.Both stocks are expensive, I'm not invested.I'm long Intel though, since they became so cheap by delaying 7nm. I would prefer amd and nvda both but I'm late. I wouldn't place a big bet today if I were you: amd, nvda and intc are all very risky investments.",0,0.564,0.993,NEGATIVE
