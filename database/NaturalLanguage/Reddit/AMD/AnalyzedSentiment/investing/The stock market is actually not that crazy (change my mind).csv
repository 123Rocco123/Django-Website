Implied earnings growth rates in the stock price are silly.Re the Market in general: the market is valued fairly if we believe that the fed will print a trillion dollars in QE every time the equity market falls 10%.

One year ago, we had record low unemployment and the economy was doing incredible. So incredible that we had a massive run-up in the S&P in the 4th quarter, carrying us way beyond all time highs.Fast forward today: we are still in the midst of a world wide pandemic that put the breaks on a global pandemic. While hopefully we are at the tail end, there is a real chance this goes on for another year or more. Because of this, US unemployment spiked to its second highest level ever, second only to the great depression. While there has been some recovery, the unemployment rate is still higher than it was during the 2008 recession and it seems to be stalling there. There is huge politic unrest and uncertainty with the potential for a Democratic sweep that rings in policies highly unfavorable for the S&P 500 companies. The chances of that political unrest spiking over the next 3 months is high.So where would we expect the S&P? Making new all time highs before having a correction and still sitting only slightly below pre-covid all time highs? No, something seems crazy about that to me. The risks aren't priced in.I did leave out fed/monetary policy which is a huge factor. We could say it is hitting these levels because so much money has been put out there (and in to the hands of so few) that the market is the only place to absorb it.
