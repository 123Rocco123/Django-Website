I can see them maybe in a year or two starting to compete with Microsoft fairly heavily around that market. Although with AMD they seem to just really cater to gaming and bikes primarily.

I'd say that AMD has a lot of things going for it currently.It's cpu's are doing very well in the personal computer and database spaces, and it looks like their new gpu's might also be pretty competitive for the first time in a long time.The downside is that it's kinda pricey, but so are most tech stocks that are doing well.Meanwhile Intel is a company that I guess could conceivably rise back up and become the cpu leader again, so I guess you could hold on to it with that hope.However it's run by money people rather than engineers. Which in my view is a very bad thing when you're lagging behind your competitors tech.Any possible return to form is also something that is at least several years away. So you're probably looking at holding Intel for several years with little to no return purely because of a hope that they can turn things around and become competitive again.Personally I would hold on to the AMD stock and sell the Intel stock and put that money into companies that are doing well right now, rather than keeping money parked in a flailing company that doesn't have any current public plans that indicates that a turnaround is coming any time soon.",0,0.56,1.0,NEGATIVE

In theory within industries price to sales ratios tend to be similar. That's because margins on goods tend to be similar and future expected price to earnings tend to similar within whole sectors. So a good estimate for how best to diversify away the risk of marketshare moving back and forth between companies is to hold them at market weight. By holding both at market weight were the ratios similar what you are doing is hedging against both the risk that Intel continues to lose share to AMD and that Intel fixes some of its structural problems and the anticipated loss of share from Intel to AMD doesn't materializes. Holding both at market weight is from a naïve perspective a safe way to play the two.FWIW I personally default to holding them at impact weight. That is averaging out between total 5 years sales, earnings, assets and dividends (including buybacks). That creates a strong value tilt so I'd be holding a lot more Intel than AMD.",0,0.56,0.938,NEGATIVE

I reduced my intel position to open my AMD position. I wish I would have sold Intel due to its delays w/ 7nm chip production, but I don't have a habit on betting against Intel. They've been the world's chip leader for a long time and it wouldn't surprise me if their RnD department won't put them back on top over the next 5 years.Intel has also been one of the main companies when it comes to AI research which I want exposure to. The price has been beaten down a bit already due to AMD's progress. And while the battle of processors market share is a zero sum game, any AI spinoffs etc would not be.",0,0.585,0.782,POSITIVE
