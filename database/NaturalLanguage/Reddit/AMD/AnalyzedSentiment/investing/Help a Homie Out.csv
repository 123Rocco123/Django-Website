,"What's up yall. I recently got into investing and had some questions for the people that know more than I do. First I was wondering what are some good books to read to learn about investment and money management overall, I turned 18 in April and recently moved out by myself. I've been mainly watching youtube but I feel like books are also a great medium to learn from. Would it be a smart idea to invest in AMD due to the recent information that the new GPUs are going to have better performance than Nvidia's most recent 30 thousand series. Should I start off by paper trading (I want to learn options trading) and play around and see what works and what doesn't, or should I just dive in headfirst and invest smaller amounts. In advance, I just want to thank anyone who takes time out of their day to help me out!","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

While you can learn about options, I would save these until years down the road. Most people do not have a real need for using options other than speculation and fun.My recommendation for every new investor is start by just buying some S&P 500. I recommend this as it is considered a relatively safe stock investment, but it also gets you engaged in the market the first day. You can get used to seeing the S&P 500 movement on the news all day and be engaged, get used to how the market moves up and down.The next step would be books, but also the internet and YouTube. Just consume all you can, but try to avoid people trying to hype up certain things. Try to understand how the market works, not what the best investment is at this time. Look to answer simple questions like why do stocks move? Why are stocks expected to make money over time? How do stocks relate to the economy? How are stocks priced? This will help you become a successful investor over the long term.",0,0.545,0.988,POSITIVE

Again big thank you for the tips and I've already invested some money into index funds like S&P 500,1,0.513,0.91,POSITIVE
