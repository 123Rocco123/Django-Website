,"I have a taxable brokerage account worth about 260k currently. There are currently 93 positions and account is mainly being carried by big tech stocks (Apple/AMD/Tesla) and a bunch of others for 1-2k each gain/loss. How do I go about the process of getting out of these single stocks into ETF/Index Funds? I am worried about having to pay taxes on anything I sell but is this just part of the game? Sell something, buy something else, and pay taxes on whatever gains are from the stock I sold? What about losses? I barely know anything about tax loss harvesting. I am kind of just trying to figure out if there is anyway to clean up this portfolio for myself for the future. Thanks to all in advance!!

TLDR: How to move from single stocks to index funds",Any lots with a gain will automatically be offset by other lots at a loss. The net gain/loss of the sale of all stocks is all you have to worry about.I like VTI better - any large index fund is diverse by nature.,1,0.541,1.0,NEGATIVE
