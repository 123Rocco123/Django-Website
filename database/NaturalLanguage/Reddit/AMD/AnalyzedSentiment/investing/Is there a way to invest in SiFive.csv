,"Hi Guys, I've made some very good gains with AMD and NVIDIA (after holding them for several years). Sold all my shares, and looking to invest it all in SiFive.

I don't plan to buy back NVIDIA or AMD, so please avoid posts saying ""they have still room to grow"". Is there a way I can invest all of it in SiFive?
