They’d have to crush AI to move the needle. I’m not sure what their roadmap to fabbing AI chips looks like.AMD is way behind Nvidia. It may take several generations for them to catch up. Each generation takes 2 years or so. They use the same fab as Nvidia (TSMC) so it’s their designs and Nvidias CUDA holding them back.NVDA has margins of like 80%. If AMD becomes competitive they eat into those margins. They don’t get the same ones.,2,0.554,0.994,NEGATIVE

I’m already 100+ on most of them but things like XRP and HBAR, if they break local resistance may do another 4x.So I’m patient but still look for opportunities and Samsung and AMD at the moment seem to be being left behind and that money could be placed somewhere with some significant short term gains. Even NNDA x 3 looks like it could do some nice moves as it’s undervalued at the money.Palantir is tempting but I’m 4x on them already and not sure they’ll hold..",3,0.518,1.0,NEGATIVE
