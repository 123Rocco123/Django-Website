,"My goal with my current holdings is to pick stocks that I can reasonably expect to 4x or 5x over the next five years - there's no way they all will, but enough of them will.

This allows me to invest as much cash as possible and withdraw it either from that or something else in the portfolio if I suddenly need the money - also if it dips the growth may have dipped more, enabling me to add money to growth stocks.

Edit: Haha since I posted this I've been doing really well, much better than the guy who laughed at my medical issues! I sold NEE and WMT for WFC, and fused all the semiconductors except just 2xAMD into SMH, taking profits in the process I also have a MELI and a tiny bit of boring VUG. Edit2: Sold AXP for V. Trimmed SQ, bought FB.","As a fellow mid-20s person, how big is your portfolio? I couldn't fathom having even 10 stocks under my wing. You sir must have a lotttt of cash.",0,0.518,0.813,POSITIVE
,"My goal with my current holdings is to pick stocks that I can reasonably expect to 4x or 5x over the next five years - there's no way they all will, but enough of them will. I view none as gambles unlike certain speculative stocks - I'm betting on the future. Portion 1 (Growth, 80%) AAPL 11.3%, MSFT 11%, SQ 11%, LRCX 10%, AMD 9%, MTCH 8.5%, TTD 7.6% Edit Aug 23: Due to very good performance of the portfolio and some components, I've sold half my SQ/MSFT for QQQ and growth ETFs. DOCU 4.3%, TSLA 4%, NXPI 4%, ETSY 4%, ARKK 4%, ARKQ 3%, ARKG 2.4%, LABU 1.9% ARKF 1%, AVGO 1%, QQQJ 1%, DDD 0.6%, ARKX 0.3%, ICLN 0.1% A small portion of the portfolio is allocated to insurance/banks that I think can outperform their own sector - a bit based of fundamental valuations, and are present should the day that the inflation attack comes hit growth and boost banks. This stabilizes the portfolio through a period that I may want to retain my growth stocks amidst them being a little underwater or lagging i.e. this is the enabler. Portion 2 (11%): PRU 21%, ALLY 21%, BMO 21%, PNC 21%, AXP 16% A smaller portion of the portfolio is dedicated to low-volatility and drawdown components - save for a few days/events here and there. This allows me to invest as much cash as possible and withdraw it either from that or something else in the portfolio if I suddenly need the money - also if it dips the growth may have dipped more, enabling me to add money to growth stocks. The underperformance of this component is addressed by the growth portion. Portion 3 (9%): SPY 40%, VYM 17.5%, WMT 12.5%, QYLD 10%, XLRE 10%, NEE 8% I'm in my low to mid-20s, but I have it so bad with medical issues that there's no way my time horizon is until the age of 50, for I'm not sure how long I can or should live past then when my symptoms will worsen. I need to grow this now and then save my body for whatever life I have left. Goals aside, there's the portfolio for ratings and viewings.

Also I still struggle financially since I can't work for an income any more - so this has to grow and once it does I convert it to something that can pay for my necessities, including medical or therapeutic stuff, or even saved to sue a hospital or my state if I need an emergency procedure and I can't it anywhere.
