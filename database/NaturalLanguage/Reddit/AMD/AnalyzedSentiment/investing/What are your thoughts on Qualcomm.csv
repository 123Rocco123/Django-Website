,"All, Have been following and holding Qualcomm for about 2 years now. I know that smartphones is a cyclical industry and is currently in a slump. Qualcomm still has high inventory issues and have guided another quarter of falling revenues and earnings. Having said that, Qualcomm's intrinsic value based on DCF is around $156 https://valueinvesting.io/QCOM/valuation/dcf-growth-exit-5y It is diversifying beyond smartphones and is aggressively pursuing automotive and IoT markets. It also released a new chip that brings AI to smartphones. While the applications are limited to battery monitoring and camera improvements (hardware based) right now, they can easily move to other areas of enhancements. Regarding loss of revenues from Apple, it will still take Apple 3-4 years to phase out existing devices that use Qualcomm chips. The 5 billion revenue Qualcomm gets from Apple will be covered by IoT + automotive by then. Lastly, people can only delay buying a smartphone, not avoid it completely, especially buying high end phones. Which means once the slump is over, Qualcomm will make a very strong comeback. Any thoughts? I want to buy more but would love to hear some critical arguments in the mean time. Edit: Qualcomm's also making PC chips. Remains to be seen if they can eat Intel's lunch like AMD. https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/qualcomm-claims-laptops-destroy-intel-chips-in-ai/",I’m considering buying it as a possible competitor to NVIDIA,0,0.532,0.868,NEGATIVE
