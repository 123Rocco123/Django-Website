,Hello I was presented the following stock breakdowns for my Roth IRA when I asked two different friends. The first one says 40% VOO 25% VTI 25% SCHD 10% JEPQ. The other says 25% AAPL 15% VOO 10% VTI 10% XOM 15% MSFT 15% AMZN 10% NVDA/AMD. What do you think about these breakdowns? Which would you choose? I don't want a ton of micro management with my Roth IRA.,Both are terrible. That second one especially so. I wouldn’t pick either one.The first one is just tons of overlap.Just use one total market index like VTI.,0,0.541,1.0,NEGATIVE

I don't want a ton of micro management with my Roth IRA.,"Neither of those make any sense. VOO is in VTI, AAPL is a large portion of both, and is AMZN, MSFT, etc. It's completely unnecessary. Do 100% VT or VTI or 80/20 VTI/VXUS, something like that.",0,0.504,1.0,NEGATIVE

I don't want a ton of micro management with my Roth IRA.,There’s no secret here. Diversification within IRA is effective but there are drawbacks for both types.The Roth vs Traditional IRA debate is a function of 1) your current earnings and future earnings with respect to taxable income bracket and 2) your expectations of tax brackets overall.Roth IRA provides you with significantly more flexibility. No income in the future or forced distributions can be a huge benefit as retirees pull from nest egg.,1,0.52,0.99,NEGATIVE

I don't want a ton of micro management with my Roth IRA.,"If you want tax free to kids, inherited IRAs will still be subject to income tax. These need to be emptied within a 10 year period so if the IRA balance is quite large, the tax can be daunting to the beneficiary. Inherited Roth IRAs require distribution but no taxation.",3,0.54,0.97,NEGATIVE
