,"For all the AMD / Nvidia fanboys, tech specs are here. Cant just endlessly say Intel is terrible. https://wccftech.com/intel-core-i5-12600k-cpu-faster-than-ryzen-5-5600x-blows-away-rocket-lake-core-i9-11900k-leaked-benchmarks/ The performance benchmarks show the Intel Core i5-12600K blasting up the single-core test with a score of 773 points and the multi-core test with 7220 points. This puts the Core i5 Alder Lake at a massive 50% lead over the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X and even faster than AMD's 8 core and 16 thread Ryzen 7 5800X which is very impressive. Versus the leaked Core i5-12400 benchmarks, the Core i5-12600K offers a 45% increase in multi-threaded performance which means that those E-cores are being used properly plus the higher clock speeds really push the performance even further. Even Intel's Rocket Lake flagship couldn't keep up with the new Core i5 chip which ends up 13% faster in single and 10% faster in the multi-core tests. Now think about it this way, you are essentially getting slightly better performance than the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, a $400 US+ chip, in a processor that costs $30 US lower than the Ryzen 5 5600X. It sounds like an absolutely phenomenal deal. Obviously, there are a few drawbacks which include investing in a brand new platform and migrating to a new OS platform (Windows 11 in this case) which would raise the cost and effort but if you set your mind aside from these short-term concerns, the Core i5-12600K could end up serving you far better performance at an insane value proposition. Furthermore, it is also stated that owing to the 12600K being segmented in the Core i5 lineup, its power consumption and thermals won't be as rampant as the high-end models.","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

Still holding and add though this tough peroid. But let's not joke. Anyone who knows anything knows that:INTC 10nm benchmarks mean ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.INTC always has and still puts out inaccurate or non comparable benchmark test. All of the chip makers do tests in environment, in scenarios, selecting tasks, and hooked up to optimal settings for themselves. https://wccftech.com/intel-real-world-performance-misleading-benchmarks-intel-core-vs-amd-ryzen-cpus/ Only difference is INTC is using the smoke and mirrors harder because they really are behind.If INTC chips who's benchmarks have been blowing out the competition the last +10 years. Then why is their stock price and earnings are going down during a semi shortage, their competitors' earnings and stock prices are rallying multiple times over, their CEO got fired, and AAPL is constantly cutting those benchmark breaking INTC chips from their products?Saying INTC 10nms are faster than competitors would be like Motorola saying the Razr is better than the Ipod in 2010. It means literally nothing because Iphone 3 had basically killed all the dumb-smart phones and Motorola will be bought up by google in a year.INTC isn't going back up until they catchup on the chip design, foundry, and manufacturing.
