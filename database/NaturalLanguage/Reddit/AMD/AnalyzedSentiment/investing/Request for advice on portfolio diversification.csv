,"I've hung onto a sizeable chunk of AAPL for 15 years, snagged back in 2008 at the opportune moment. For all that time, I never felt the urge to venture into other investments until the recent buzz surrounding AI. Like everyone else, I was wowed by NVDA's stellar performance, just as AAPL seemed to hit a plateau and face some challenges. As a result, I offloaded half of my AAPL in November for NVDA. Come January, I found myself questioning why I hadn't just sold the whole lot, especially considering that one's growth trajectory was bound to outshine the other in the same timeframe. However, by then, NVDA had already nearly doubled. This prompted me to scrutinize the market more closely, leading to selling off the remaining half of my AAPL and diversifying my portfolio. Today, here's where I stand: - 61% NVDA - 11% SMTC - 9% MSFT - 6% ORCL - 6% MU - 3% MRVL - 2.5% AMD - 2.5% PLTR First off, I'm keen to hear your take on this mix of investments. Secondly, I'm pondering why I opted for seven different stocks instead of going all-in on NVDA, much like I did with AAPL in 2008. Let's be clear: I chose these stocks because I believe they offer reasonable profit prospects over a 3 to 5-year window for the entire portfolio. However, I'm still convinced that within a one-year timeframe, NVDA is likely to outperform the rest. Bottom line: Did I make the sensible move by diversifying across different stocks, or does my gut feeling that I should focus on the big player hold merit?","It’s spread a little. But most would say it’s not very diverse. What’s green for one may be green for all and vice versa. NVDA is my current biggest holding but it’s at about 22%. I don’t expect as much growth over the next few years as it has seen over the past year or two. But I do expect it to continue to move up.I like it, but it’s very aggressive. If the risk reward plays in your favor I’ll be along for the ride. Just not with the same percentages.",0,0.537,0.995,NEGATIVE

Even if you want all NVDA, it would still make sense to also have AMD and SMH. You then would have the stock most likely (even if unlikely) to cut into NVDA's market share and then the whole industry so if NVDA does stumble you will have every other big company that might benefit from them stumbling.If you choose to not be very diversified, the point of what you do hold besides your main holding is not to do as well as the main holding but to gather up some lost market share if disaster hits the main holding (and you).",0,0.557,0.983,NEGATIVE

It is a risky bet. NVDA is leading the semiconductor industry. But it seems it's been priced in already.",0,0.566,0.999,NEGATIVE
