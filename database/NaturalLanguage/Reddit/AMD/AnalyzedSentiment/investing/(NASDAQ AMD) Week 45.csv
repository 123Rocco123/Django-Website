,"In reference to last week’s Q3 2020 earnings report, AMD is clearly not “struggling” per say. Along with the announcement of AMD acquiring Xilinx, the Ryzen series 3 CPU’s hitting markets Thursday (11.5), and the 6000 series GPU’s releasing mid month and early Dec — this is shaping to be a promising RoI.

With the acquisition of Xilinx, AMD becomes more of a threat to its rivals (Intel & NVIDIA) in the data center sector. Unlike your average consumer (AMD vs Intel vs NVIDIA), data centers will always prefer price:performance rather than simple branding. If this merge works in AMD’s favor, in time data centers will begin to adopt AMD architecture over NVIDIA (if price:performance is reasonable) thus increasing overall profit.",0,0.569,0.998,NEGATIVE
