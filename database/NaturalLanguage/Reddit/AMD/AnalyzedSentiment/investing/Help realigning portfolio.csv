Next, were I planning on dumping the lot you list at about 10% of my portfolio, I'd think about moving it into VOO, MOAT, DIA, or similar. If you wanted more income generation, perhaps VYM or similar. Adding to your cash position with Treasury Direct is worth consideration too. You're a little tech heavy for my personal taste.Full disclosure, I don't recognise that third group (27%) and didn't look them up, simply assuming them to be popular ETFs. This could really make my thoughts out of whack. I also own VOO, MOAT, DIA, and VYM. They are some of my largest positions in my taxable account.",0,0.526,0.677,POSITIVE
