Date of sale: June 17, 2024.","Imho, The biggest threat to AMD right now isn't Nvidia...it's what's going on with the ARM processors beyond what started out as good mobile processor. Apple blazed the trail by successfully showing what a well developed ARM processor could do beyond just the iPhone and into now laptops and now heavier weight desktop and server... The latest M4s are looking pretty good and apple has successfully decoupled from x86. Windows has no choice but to embrace ARM and decouple from X86.For mobile computing, before it was acceptable to tradeoff raw computing power for battery consumption, hence why ARM SOCs were preferred.. but now that performance gap is closing. Qualcomms latest batch of snapdragon processors might actually gain some footing now too with the Snapdragon X Elite finding its way into laptops ....and this is going to pave the way for Samsung to follow too with Exynos processors beyond mobile phones. I've worked with them before and they always wanted into in-source their own ARM processor into all their computing devices, it just wasn't as good as Qualcomms and probably still isn't. This is also going to open the door for lower tier players like MediaTek to sell their ARM processor into the computing space. They companies need to do this because the growth of mobile phones has been stagnant so these companies need to find another channel to sell their products to.. so it's happening in the computing space. These don't need to be the fastest and most powerful laptops they just have to be ""good enough"" for the average consumer ...with emphasis on better power consumption. The average consumer is not a power user unlike some of us geeks.So the competition for AMD has gotten much stiffer on the personal computing space because they aren't just going to be competing against Intel and Nvidia but also all of the previous mobile chip companies that made a decent SOC that can repurpose it for a laptop or desktop and eventually a server.Windows 11 can run just fine with an ARM processor so this could pose a long term issue to the x86 architecture.Server/enterprise side will take more time so that isn't as big a threat....That said, I'm still an long term AMD shareholder. Because the few shares I kept all the back to $3.50/share shortly after Dr. Lisa Su took the helm...so for me, I really can't lose......but these days I'm camping more out in TSM and SOXL.Everyone uses TSM, even Intel is using TSM now for part of their chip fabNow....If I only held converted those 30 AMD call options with a $10 strike price back then instead of selling them when AmD hit $50 ....and also held onto my Nvidia shares purchased at $50ish...... and have kept all my employer issued Qualcomm stock and later, my employer issued Broadcom stock too before Avago took over ...but oh no , play it safe they said... take profit they said....keep stock that pays a dividend they said....why the fuck did I listen and keep this POS deadhorse Intel instead.... for someone that was very much part of ground 0 in the semi industry, I have to say , I blew it.......Goodbye McLaren P1, hello pre-owned 570s.

Imho, a lot of this has more to do with how the sales team does than actually technology itself.Enterprise hardware and software sales is a completely different beast from consumer facing sales.A lot of ""non-tech"" strategery goes to making an enterprise sale .That's how Intel was able to hold onto enterprise customers as long as they did despite having inferior products. Same could be said about Qualcomm wireless connectivity (Atheros) in the early days which was a complete POS. Broadcom did a number on them for a while... we open sourced our Bluedroid connectivity stack, donated it to Google/AOSP android, who replaced the existing Bluez stack... It screwed everyone else over because they had to redo all the software for a few quarters 🤣 Qualcomm was likewise trying to screw everyone else over by selling their combo baseband and connectivity chip cheaper than the baseband chip itself because they were trying to vendor lock suppliers in to a complete Qualcomm solution. The Atheros connectivity solution in the early days was awful (anyone that had a Nexus 4 android phone knew that , it was one of the Google devices that had used the Atheros connectivity )... So some companies ended up buying the combo chip and disabled the connectivity solution and used a standalone Broadcom chip which was better at the time. Broadcom tried to build a 5G baseband processor , but failed miserably doing it along with Intel who also failed. So did Apple. I guess people underestimated how difficult it would be to do one 🤣 that's one of the reasons who Broadcom eventually agreed to be acquired by Avago, after they lost in the baseband chip war.",2,0.538,1.0,NEGATIVE
