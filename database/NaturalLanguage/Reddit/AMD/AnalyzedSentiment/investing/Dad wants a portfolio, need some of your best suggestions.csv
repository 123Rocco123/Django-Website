,"Hey there, so basically the title says it all. I've been trading for more or less a year with some pretty solid returns. Now my dad got wind of the ""easy money"" I made and wants me to manage his small portfolio. He's got a little capital and wants ""great returns with as little risk as possible"". (who does not want that?!, but hey who to blame?) So I thought, 40% tech stocks/disruptive innovation stocks, maybe NIO, SQ, AMD, NVDIA, SNAP(Goldman Sachs raised their price target to 70$..?) ROKU(?), LMND(?), maybeee TSLA (even thou everything the technical analysis shows is that it is currently overvalued). Then maybe 30% more risk averse stocks, some boomer stock like AMZN or MT or some E-commerce like ETSY. Maybe some ETF, like the ARK ETF? The last 30% for more high risk stocks, maybe some Cannabis-Stock? Cannabis ETF? Tilray? Aurora? Maybe some cryptos? He gives me a year to proove that it is possible to make mad gainz in the stock market and wants to take my mom on a vacation like they've never been before. What do you think of this constellation? What would you change/do better than me? Is it ""too late"" for any of these stocks? If anybody got good advice, let me know! I really don't want to loose all his money, mine I don't care.
