Based on the exchange ratio, this represents approximately $143 per share of Xilinx common stock2. Post-closing, current AMD stockholders will own approximately 74 percent of the combined company on a fully diluted basis, while Xilinx stockholders will own approximately 26 percent. The transaction is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes.","If you think the whole market won't crush again and AMD will become THE chip maker and bigger than Intel and nVidia, because they're the only with a portfolio that covers both HPC CPU and GPU, yes.Otherwise AMD is expensive. But everything is expensive if you consider yourself a value investor. Nvidia bough ARM for a reason.AMD is definitely the most interesting and a risky bet. But with more potential than Intel and nVidia imho.",1,0.574,0.966,POSITIVE

Let me know if I am thinking about this right.The transaction details state that XLNX shareholders will become 26% shareholders of AMD’s market cap, so a 26:74 dilution ratio would be a dilution of about 35%. AMD trades about $79 right now, and 35% of 79 is about $28. So basically what this means is, as AMD dilutes the shares, AMD could trade for $51, which is simply today’s price taking into account the dilution. If that’s the case, XLNX would basically be “worth” ~ $88 ($51 * 1.7234). Is this accurate? Can anybody clarify or let me know where this is wrong? (Of course, we don’t know what the market will pay for AMD shares at any point.)",0,0.552,1.0,NEGATIVE
