If you just consider Amazons online market place, one could imagine that walmart and temu and wayfair(trash) might continue to eat away at its once complete dominance. I know I buy less on Amazon these days as the prices have not been as clearly cheapest as they used to be in the past. I find myself buying stuff on sale at brick and mortar stores or even ebay because Amazon is often the most expensive now for popular staples and high demand items.Long story short, someone is not taking over Amazon's online market place next week, but like evolution, things happen quick. And Amazon needs its subscribers and crazy volume and 3rd party folk tinremain profitable. a decline in market share and subscriptions can really tank its online retail, even just over a couple years.edit: to add one more thing... I often shop for items doing a wide internet search now and buy the cheapest offering. this often means buying from smaller, niche websites that just sell protein bars maybe. A search tool for shopping that is widely adopted, user friendly, where people dont shop on specificnwevsites but shop through this 3rd party search engine regularly would be quite a disruptor. I know they exist in forms but they are often clunky and not widely used.",1,0.523,0.726,NEGATIVE
