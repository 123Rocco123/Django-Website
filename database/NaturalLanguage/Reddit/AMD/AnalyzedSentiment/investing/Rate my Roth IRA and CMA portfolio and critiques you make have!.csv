,"18 years old just trying to make sure I’m set up well for retirement. I started investing mid year 2024. I believe my ROTH overlaps a bit and would be happy for it to be critiqued so I can get the most appreciation. This is my first year of investing so I only have 7k in my Roth and 2k invested in my CMA. I have 20k sitting in fidelity ready to invest as well. And would like to put at least 7k of it in a TBIL for next years Roth investment. Looking to buy an investment property to rent out within the next year or 2. I work 2 jobs and currently in real estate pre-salesperson course to get my real estate license. ROTH IRA: FSKAX 3.006 shares ($484.92) IJH 8.031 shares ($503.46) IJR 5.022 shares ($579.58) PG 2.82 shares ($478.96) QQQM 8.012 shares ($1,628.11) SPLG 52.1 shares ($3,566.18) CMA: QQQM 4.006 shares ($814.05) AMD 6.251 shares ($950.96) FZROX 9.997 shares ($203.96) I already feel like PG should be in my CMA and that FSKAX AND SPLG overlap but I’m not sure which one to keep. Also, are IJH and IJR the best small and mid caps I can have? Just need major suggestions on it all. Thank you!","I would go with SPLG over FSKAX. That's just my preference. Either one is fine but you don't need both. I don't hold any small cap or mid cap. Again, just my preference. IJH and IJR are good funds though. They are a little more volatile and higher risk but could have higher reward. PG is a good company but I prefer not to own individual stocks, only ETFs. QQQM is a good one.I don't think you're doing a bad job. You're on the right track. The decision is ultimately up to you.",0,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.926

Also, are IJH and IJR the best small and mid caps I can have? Just need major suggestions on it all. Thank you!","Consider consolidating FSKAX (broader exposure) and removing SPLG for simplicity.Move PG to CMA and focus your Roth on growth funds.Diversify CMA beyond tech-heavy holdings (e.g., QQQM and AMD).IJH and IJR are good, but FSKAX might already cover small/mid-caps.Diversify with international funds or other sectors.Anyways you're off to a great start!",0,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.999
