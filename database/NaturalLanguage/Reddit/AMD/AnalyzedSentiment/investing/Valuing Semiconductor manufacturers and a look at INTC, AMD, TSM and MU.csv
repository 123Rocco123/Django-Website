,"I would like to build a position in a semiconductor manufacturer as their valuations come under pressure in the downturn for this cycle. I intend to look at the data they release in the upcoming earnings reports. As I look at that information what do you think are the most critical components of it to determine the outlook for these companies? I'm currently looking at their PE, Forward PE, Price to Earnings Growth and Price to Free Cash Flow. Stocks on my list at the moment are INTC, AMD, TSM and MU. This is in part because I'd like to buy an even lot eventually so that I can hedge and potentially profit with options. As I see it right now INTC is a multiyear recovery story with a high dividend that may need to come down with all the capital outlay involved in their turnaround despite having plenty of free cash flow. While their PE looks cheap compared to some others their FPE looks about inline and analysts don't see much more room to the upside. I am wary. AMD looks like it has some potential despite having a high current PE their FPE looks to be a little but mostly inline. Their Price to Earnings Growth and Free Cash Flow look less attractive but at the moment analysts are still calling for some reasonable upside to the stock. TSM looks to be growing well according to the Price to Earnings Growth but the stock price has mostly priced that in and the Free Cashflow looks to be under pressure. Its 2.47% dividend is potentially under even more pressure than INTC according to the financials as it commits to expanding here in the states. Lastly MU seems to be struggling the most with Cash Flow out of the four and potentially hitting a growth slowdown. Thoughts about the companies themselves and advice about trying to determine the value of these businesses going forward are much appreciated.","Don’t forget ASML, all of the companies you mention rely on them",0,0.527,0.998,POSITIVE

For that AMD might not be getting the same kind of CHIPSy tailwind as the others.Last couple years with the chip shortage from the pandemic showed the US manufacturing was maybe at the mercy of foreign countries, so there was that decision to invest heavily in US chip manufacturing. It might have swung the pendulum too far, where chips where quite profitable when supplies were short, I expect all this new capacity to decrease the profitability on chips for at least a couple years as supply capacity might out pace demand.Warren B. just dumped a load into TSM, and he has made money before, so there's that. He can also change the price of stocks for as much as he dumps in, so on a short term basis, that might be a factor. That Colorado river has been getting pretty low, which could be a factor with TSM as well.",0,0.542,0.999,NEGATIVE

Lastly MU seems to be struggling the most with Cash Flow out of the four and potentially hitting a growth slowdown. Thoughts about the companies themselves and advice about trying to determine the value of these businesses going forward are much appreciated.","INTC is a deep value play, war with China and potential invasion of Taiwan threatens TSM manufacturing dominance and the other companies that source their manufacturing to TSM like AMD as others have mentioned. Intel has 3 fab and manufacturing sites in the US, is investing big money into more US manufacturing capability in Ohio and has three fab and manufacturing facilities operating in Ireland and Israel. I’m bullish on Intel long term, but think the general market decline and likely recession will impact their share price in 2023. Will be looking in the $20-$25 range to continue averaging down.
