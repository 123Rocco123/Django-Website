,"Hey everyone! I am going to start off by saying that I was interested in the stock market since I turned 17. Before that I was an absolute computer nerd, building custom pcs and selling them, trading graphics cards, etc. I put my savings in a pension fund that was started by my father for me. Unfortunately it was restricted for sale until I turned 21. When I was 18 in 2016 I wanted to invest in AMD, but my bank advisor and my family (who are conservative farmers in central europe) forbid me to take out any money to start a stock account. I had no cash because I sadly developed a heavy trinking problem that I still can't shake off, so I just cruised along, dropped out of school, worked factory and construction jobs and didn't think about investing until I was 21. At that point I was able to take out the money from the pension fund, looked at the prices of AMD. And instead of investing in AMD or similar big tech companys, I got angry at missing out on a 30x play and started off betting tons of money on companys on the brink of bankruptcy. Ofcourse non of the stocks I invested in recovered and I started options trading which put me further in a hole. I managed to lose over 70k when I turned 23. On the site I developed an addiction for casino and sports betting aswell, fast forward to now. I am 26, lost 110k, have 20k gambling debt, unemployed, family disowned me (my father starts a fight everytime I see him) and everytime I have more than 1k of cash I burn it on options. I fail miserably everytime. Just yesterday for whatever reason I bought pypl Jan 19 puts with a strike of 60$ just minutes before the CEO made a positive announcement and the bull run took off. I don't even know why I did it, because my sentiment on Paypal is positive aswell. Just last week I convinced my brother to buy 10k of pypl stock. I generally give good advise to people, but somehow manage to make my own trades exactly the opposite of what I would suggest to peers. I just don't know what to do anymore and feel like I am living in a real life hell. I have been to 25+ job interviews but no one would give me a good opportunity and I have a feeling people and employers just want nothing to do with me. Does anyone know what they would do in my situation?",Thanks. I am on it.,0,0.52,0.995,POSITIVE

Finances and investing are the last thing you should be worrying about right now. Consider therapy, perhaps? Or at least get physically and mentally healthy. Exercise routine? Meditation?

When I was 18 in 2016 I wanted to invest in AMD, but my bank advisor and my family (who are conservative farmers in central europe) forbid me to take out any money to start a stock account. I had no cash because I sadly developed a heavy trinking problem that I still can't shake off, so I just cruised along, dropped out of school, worked factory and construction jobs and didn't think about investing until I was 21. At that point I was able to take out the money from the pension fund, looked at the prices of AMD. And instead of investing in AMD or similar big tech companys, I got angry at missing out on a 30x play and started off betting tons of money on companys on the brink of bankruptcy. Ofcourse non of the stocks I invested in recovered and I started options trading which put me further in a hole. I managed to lose over 70k when I turned 23. On the site I developed an addiction for casino and sports betting aswell, fast forward to now. I am 26, lost 110k, have 20k gambling debt, unemployed, family disowned me (my father starts a fight everytime I see him) and everytime I have more than 1k of cash I burn it on options. I fail miserably everytime. Just yesterday for whatever reason I bought pypl Jan 19 puts with a strike of 60$ just minutes before the CEO made a positive announcement and the bull run took off. I don't even know why I did it, because my sentiment on Paypal is positive aswell. Just last week I convinced my brother to buy 10k of pypl stock. I generally give good advise to people, but somehow manage to make my own trades exactly the opposite of what I would suggest to peers. I just don't know what to do anymore and feel like I am living in a real life hell. I have been to 25+ job interviews but no one would give me a good opportunity and I have a feeling people and employers just want nothing to do with me. Does anyone know what they would do in my situation?",Jordan Belfort is a rat. He should be hanged. Guy made a video where he suggested to millions of people to buy GME as much as they can and published it right after GME peaked and started freefalling.

,"Hey everyone! I am going to start off by saying that I was interested in the stock market since I turned 17. Before that I was an absolute computer nerd, building custom pcs and selling them, trading graphics cards, etc. I put my savings in a pension fund that was started by my father for me.
