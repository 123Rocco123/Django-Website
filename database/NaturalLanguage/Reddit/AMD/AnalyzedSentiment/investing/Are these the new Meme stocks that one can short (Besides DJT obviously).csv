,"First of all, is crazy that Donald Trump, an ex president of the Unied States, is literally using a playbook created in Reddit, to get a bag, his company is even attacking Citadel, which is crazy hahahaha. Well, a Nasdaq article says that the next stocks that could follow a similar path are this ones: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Tbh they all seem like they could be shorted and that gains would arrive soon, at least in the next month. But what are your thoughts? Are they worth shorthing, just like DJT is?",Even mentioning those last three with DJT means you should stay away from shorting until you at least get a basic familiarity with how it works.,0,0.513,0.739,NEGATIVE

But what are your thoughts? Are they worth shorthing, just like DJT is?","Calling AMD a meme stock is nonsensical. AMD's 2023 revenue each hour was about what DJT's was for the year. None of those stocks is remotely a meme stock, so again you should avoid shorting until at least you understand it.So, my strategy has been to look for new meme stocks that Reddit/cultists will pick, and then short them.That's not a strategy. Save your money and heartache and buy VOO, then revisit other choices next year.",2,0.613,1.0,NEGATIVE

That's why I say you should watch more than just jump into shorting stuff just because they have done well. In general, retail investors lose their shirts shorting.One thing you can do is: make yourself some paper shorts... and also make some paper stock purchases. See how you do. If you want to follow a path of stock anti-picking, do it first successfully with large amounts of play money. And then also do it against a benchmark, like you picking stocks to buy and hold or the simple benchmark of owning VOO.
