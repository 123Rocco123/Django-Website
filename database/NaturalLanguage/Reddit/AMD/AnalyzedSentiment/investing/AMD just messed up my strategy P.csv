,"Hey there everyone, Wondering what you guys would do in my place. I had some AMD stocks, which as you probably know, dropped along with most of the market last week.

This is the problem with automatic stop-losses. Yes, you should have a strategy for downside risk to avoid becoming a bag holder, but it should not be based on an artificial trigger.",2,0.517,1.0,NEGATIVE

I will continue to watch but rarely do I average down as I view this as throwing good money after bad. (Helps me avoid becoming a bag holder.)You need to remember if you lose 50%, the stock needs to double just to get back to even.For the upside, I typically sell 1/3 or 1/4 if it grows 25-50% (no harm in taking profits). If it doubles, I sell half and let the remainder ride as I view these as ""free"" shares from my original investment dollars. They become part of ""hold and forget"" portfolio that I only tap if I need the money for a big purchase (car, home remodel, vacation...). Today, my ""hold and forget"" include HON (~$30 - original cost basis), META ($19), AMD ($2), GE ($6 pre reverse split), LLY ($60).I learned one thing - slow and steady wins the race.Good Luck.",4,0.533,0.998,POSITIVE

You buy a portfolio of different stocks (growth/value) for your investment timeline.If your target was 6 Months, then you don’t look back at the stocks until 6 months. If you are below target you need to study why they failed to meet. If you are at/above, sell and take your gains",2,0.559,1.0,NEGATIVE

For example, I have money in three different broad index funds those all have a diverse allocation. 2 of the 3 funds are 30 year bets, they have no exit floor. One fund has a 15% exit floor (but agin broad fund so that would be a pretty rough market shock). Then for my brokerage account identify growth stocks that I want to individually pick, but you have to do the math and look at something to identify I’ll volatile it is . Especially tech stocks they can easily drop 10% so if you set your floor to close you’re gonna selloff very quickly. So yes, you can set an exit floor but you have to understand what the probability of a downward swing is given your timeframe and then analyze the probability of return within that same timeframe. So you should have set your exit floor significantly lower.",4,0.524,0.999,NEGATIVE

But given macroeconomic conditions, I am cautious about whether AMD would hold in the next few months. My stop loss would be below the $94.50 price area. I would dollar cost average into AMD until it breaks that key price point.Alternatively, as a trader, I also follow the convention of buying stocks when buyers have proven to have taken control. These simple guidelines include:10 Daily MA over 20 Daily MAPrice is over 5 Daily MAPrice has remained over anchored VWAP of low of the month.Price has repeatedly bounced off 50 MA in 5 minute time frame.",4,0.545,1.0,NEGATIVE
