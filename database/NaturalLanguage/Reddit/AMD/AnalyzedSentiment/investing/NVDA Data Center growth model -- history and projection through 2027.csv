Lately there is a lot of opinion about the coming onslaught of competition that will derail Nvidia and an equally noisy narrative about AI being pure hype. In my view this article puts both those arguments to rest by quantifying the competition, and by providing actual unit/revenue history paired with a segment perspective from non biased, long time industry observer. Data Center is just one segment of Nvidia's business. Automotive, Omniverse, Software services are their next mulit-billion$ opportunities. NVDA is a freight train that will not be impeded.","I've been waiting on them to get basically where they are now. Bought originally back in 2014 and I wouldn't dare sell at this point, it's about to get insane as people/ investors start to realize what I have for years. They are definitely not overvalued. I took some profits once in 2017 which wasn't much relative to ownership, but paid myself and bought 500+shares of AMD to hedge myself slightly. That's worked out great too and there's room for both in my portfolio but NVDA is the better playWhat I said back in 2017 ðŸ‘‡ and this has sure aged wellhttp://stocktwits.com/mikel3113/message/71190466",0,0.535,0.64,NEGATIVE
