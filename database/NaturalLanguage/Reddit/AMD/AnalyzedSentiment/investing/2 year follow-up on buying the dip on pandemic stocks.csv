Ben Graham’s quote rings true:  “In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.” Perhaps counterintuitively, I’ve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers.  Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both.  Math In 2023 I also started practicing math daily (243 days straight as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I’d done any meaningful math.  I’m not sure how much, but it feels like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not.  Conviction A big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term.  However, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths.  Conviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I’ve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I’m not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I’m happy I did.  A big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial.  This is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise, you must seize them. Patience As a result of my convictions, I’m much more patient in my investing these days and don’t react to the day-to-day.  I wouldn’t be surprised if I don’t make another trade for the rest of 2024.

Ben Graham’s quote rings true:  “In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.” Perhaps counterintuitively, I’ve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers.  Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both.  Math In 2023 I also started practicing math daily (243 days straight as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I’d done any meaningful math.  I’m not sure how much, but it feels like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not.  Conviction A big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term.  However, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths.  Conviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I’ve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I’m not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I’m happy I did.  A big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial.  This is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise, you must seize them. Patience As a result of my convictions, I’m much more patient in my investing these days and don’t react to the day-to-day.  I wouldn’t be surprised if I don’t make another trade for the rest of 2024.

Ben Graham’s quote rings true:  “In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.” Perhaps counterintuitively, I’ve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers.

Conviction A big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term.  However, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths.  Conviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I’ve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I’m not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I’m happy I did.  A big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity.

This is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise, you must seize them.

Building chips is really, really hard. All hyperscalers may have their own chips for commodity workloads. But the cutting edge is different and where the value seems to be for a few reasons.The newest cutting edge chips are faster and more energy efficient. This means even if they cost more, they may be cheaper to run due to the efficiency and less time needed training.The other thing is speed matters. Look at each time a new model launches, like GPT, Llama, Claude, etc. That's where the attention is. So when it takes a year to train a new model getting one to market 3 months earlier is a big deal.So, that's why the cutting edge matters so much. Then there's the ecosystem (CUDA).But most importantly like I mentioned in the beginning, building chips is so hard. Designing these chips is all Nvidia does, so I don't see hyperscalers catching up. I also don't see AMD catching up since even Nvidia's previous generation chips are in higher demand that AMDs latest generation. AMD is what people buy when they can't get Nvidia.I feel confident in the above for then next ~3 years. Beyond that, I don't know. Nvidia seems untouchable in the current paradigm. But there are a few risks:If demand for chips continues to far outstrip supply then those investing in AI (hyperscalers, co's, sovereigns, etc.) will be forced to use alternatives. And if they get used to it, then it weakens Nvidia's stranglehold unless they become more modular.We reach a 'good enough' plateau where faster chips aren't that important. E.g. this might happen if we hit diminishing returns with models.Probably the biggest risk: The dominant AI paradigm changes and what Nvidia is good at (where their moat is) becomes the old way of doing things and some new startup with a better approach takes the lead by doing something Nvidia can't do.However, Jensen (Nvidia CEO) has been preparing for this for decades, and that's hard to compete with.If you want a recent overview on the landscape, this is a good summary from my favorite newsletter: https://stratechery.com/2024/ai-integration-and-modularization/",1,0.546,0.998,NEGATIVE

When CUDA was where most AI dev was happening, folks more or less had to adopt Nvidia's system. But as more AI dev moves to LLMs, CUDA is less of a moat. So Nvidia needs to become more modular (flexible), meaning their GPUs can be employed in a wider range of configurations than previously when CUDA was the main thing.I believe they are moving this way according to Jensen's recent interviews, but I'm no chip expert, so I could have some details wrong.With all that money and resources, do you think they could come at par with nvda say in the next 5 years? Unless there are significant changes (e.g. a new architecture/approach to AI) I don't think anyone will catch up with Nvidia because 1) it's unlikely anyone will make better chips and 2) even if they do, it's about more than chips.Let's say Rubin is 10x faster than Blackwell and is 10 times more energy efficient. So, these companies will just replace Blackwell with Rubin? Where do the older gpus, 4-5 years older or older than this, go?I guess the same place old GPUs, CPUs and other HW go today. If they're still worth running, they'll still run in a datacenter somewhere. Once they're not worth running anymore (e.g. efficiency or density), they'll be replaced.

Math In 2023 I also started practicing math daily (243 days straight as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I’d done any meaningful math.

Conviction A big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term.  However, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths.  Conviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I’ve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way.

Though they're nowhere near Nvidia, I would expect the whole industry to appreciate, especially since Nvidia still can't meet supply needs. Plus, I only watch stocks I invest in, so this got them on my watchlist.Microsoft (MSFT) seems to be the company with the best ability to monetize AI applications at this point thanks to its existing position in enterprise. They also have a great partnership (and hefty investment) with OpenAI.Tesla (TSLA) recently dropped their previous deterministic full self driving (FSD) framework for a more probabilistic AI FSD framework. All Teslas are instrumented to capture data, so they have by far the best data. If this works, it could be a game changer. I'm also just super excited about AI being applied in new ways like this -- we're still so early.To be clear, these are all relatively small investments, but all in companies benefitting from the AI trend, which I believe we're still early in.

Ben Graham’s quote rings true:  “In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.” Perhaps counterintuitively, I’ve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers.

Math In 2023 I also started practicing math daily (243 days straight as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I’d done any meaningful math.  I’m not sure how much, but it feels like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not.  Conviction A big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term.  However, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths.  Conviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I’ve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I’m not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I’m happy I did.  A big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial.  This is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise, you must seize them.
