,"Anyone else do this or find logic in this ideology to keep track of their net investments or am I just misleading myself. E.g. I just sold a portion of my apple shares (35 shares) in which I had at an ACB of $95. Equals about $3,330 net investment The proceeds of the sale at current price ($190) was about $6,600 I used that $6,600 to buy 16 MSFT and 1 AMD. If I now want to note my ACB’s for sake of my net investments I used the $3,330 number as my investment so the breakdown is as follows 16 MSFT = about $3,240 = $202/share 1 AMD = about $90/share MSFT trading at $410 AMD trading at $178 Essentially since I didn’t add any new cash, and used my gains from Apple would it make sense to use the $202 and $90 as my share values. Of course on my actual brokerage app it would show ACB according to current market price, this is more for the sake of my own records to know what i’ve put in as net investments. Thanks!","I guess if you are looking to understand your total gain you could do this, but I think it would be far easier to just note your original cash deposits into the account and compare it to the current value across all investments.Assuming that these transactions are in a taxable account your calculations should also include the tax loss (federal, state, local as appropriate) on those gains.  If you are paying the capital gains taxes from other accounts while rolling the total into the next investment that is essentially adding new cash to your brokerage account.",0,0.53,0.992,NEGATIVE

I totally agree from just an overall perspective that would be the easiest way to do it. I just like to know the numbers on a per holding basis as well (over complicates it). Also because a lot of these holdings are held between different accounts, etc this gives me an overall ACB for just say my apple shares even if half are in a taxable account and half are in a tax deferred account.I am in Canada and these transactions in specific took place in my tax free savings account so no tax implications.",1,0.515,1.0,POSITIVE

Thanks!",Seems kinda pointless. Just track your cash inputs and calculate your money-weighted return and you'll get the same math.,0,0.512,1.0,NEGATIVE
