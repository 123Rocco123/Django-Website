Some of the larger companies may be doing their own work on this but I’m not sure of which publicly traded companies have these as products yet.Liquid immersion cooling isn’t really a new technology it’s just that it’s expensive to implement and takes up more space. But people are saying these AI chips will need liquid immersion cooling. 70% of power used in datacenters is just for cooling/heat removal. So yes I could see network providers like google being at the forefront of implementing these types of solutions especially because they have a large budget and they don’t have to worry about collocation clients.Ultimately for datacenter operators I feel the demand has to come due to either govt regulations or client demand. These datacenters will have to change their whole design and build and update all their equipment and void current warranties so it may take a while to implement.

This addresses the problem of net congestion that data centers are facing around the world, by being able to generate power locally from natural gas (usually abundant and cheap, typically greener than grid average but not zero emission of course) or from solar power (green but more expensive)",0,0.536,0.999,POSITIVE

For example consultancy firms or something like that.
