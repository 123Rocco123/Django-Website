,"So I have stock in INTC and AMD and today has been a weird day and I am trying to work out what happened. So I know if stock goes up and down it affects the NASDAQ index, but somehow it works the otherway around aswell. Intel was at 3-4% green for a long time, but at the end of the day NASDAQ tanked and so did intel and AMD. How does the falling of big companies like FB and AAPL affect the stocks on AMD and INTC. Still kind of a noob on the subject so any help is appreciated.","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

When they sell off the ‘tech funds’ for example, it’ll drop similar stocks cuz the funds often are compromised of similar holdings. It is why you see sectors of the market moving together a lot.",0,0.522,0.997,NEGATIVE

That will tell you how much, on average, the price movement of that investment is dependent on what the overall market/asset class/sector is doing. The higher the R2, the less independently it moves. Most ETFs, for example, have R2 in the high 90th-percentile.On the whole, your particular investment - whatever it is - is likely controlled more on a day-to-day basis by the market movement of its given asset class and sector than it is the fundamentals of the investment itself. It's only at the margins where you tend to see performance differences - for example, when there is news happening (or soon-to-happen) surrounding that particular investment.",2,0.525,0.932,POSITIVE

If you're a buy-and-hold investor and nothing has fundamentally changed about the underlying company or the industry in which it is operating, then it's just static noise in the overall price trend. That's why most buy-and-hold investors are advised NOT to look at what their investments are doing on a day-to-day basis but rather over longer time frames when the overall trendlines control more than the headlines of the day.Take a deep breath. With regard to AMD and INTC specifically, nothing that wasn't true of them last week when tech stocks were flying high is true of them today and vice versa.They likely flew a little too high last week (Ask yourself: Did the tech business really improve that drastically because of the presidential election to deserve that kind of price movement? No.), and they're likely going to overcorrect in the short-term. That's just the way the market tends to work in general.",4,0.558,1.0,NEGATIVE

Concerning AMD, I just have faith in the company so I dont really mind the short term. Thanks btw really usefull",5,0.554,0.994,NEGATIVE

The whole idea of buying and holding is that you see long-term value in that particular company/investment which you believe will grow over time. If you saw value before the dip, then that value only increases on the dip. The bigger the dip, the bigger the value increase on each dollar invested.",6,0.569,0.928,POSITIVE
