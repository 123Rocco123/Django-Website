,"i believe that it is inevitable that VR and mobile will take over more and more of our lives, therefore the companies that manufacture these devices (like the oculus Quest's snapdragon processor by Qualcomm) will increase dramatically in value over the next decades. is anyone aware of ETFs or some smaller cap companies like qualcomm that fit this emerging space? or do you believe larger companies like NVIDIA, AMD, and facebook will dominate this space? thanks","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

They are leading in the development of on-chip-3D processing. This gives them speed and processing power better than software by an order of magnitude. Since they lead in the technology of this, and since it is a capital intensive path to get there, they have a big moat of protection.",0,0.55,1.0,POSITIVE

They were a video control card maker for the gaming industry in their earlier days, and nobody needed 3D image control capacity like the gamers. From there it was a natural evolution to absorb more and more of the processing onto the chip hardware. Their current domination in the space is the extension of that technology evolution.",1,0.532,1.0,POSITIVE
