,"I’m 25 and currently have €48K in investments of which €46K in SXR8 and €2K divided between Intel, AMD, and Nvidia. I’ve heard about spreading assets but does that really matter when investing in S&P 500 ETFs? Should I be buying different kinds of S&P 500 stock? My point is to keep investing for the next 20 or so years before trying to retire or just sit and benefit from the interest rates.","Which exact product you have replicating the S&P500 should be irrelevant in terms of performance. There might be slight differences since most ETFs don't actually buy or sell all assets constantly, they replicate the index on statistical correlations.What might be worth considering:Is the provider of you ETF trust worthy/ stable? SXR8 is from Blackrock so that probably fine.Are you really diversified with the s&p500? Its only the US and only the largest companies. There are 6000 Stocks in the US and you ""only"" own the 500 largest. You also own nothing from other geographies.",0,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.986

It's not perfect, therefore the total stock market index might be a little better in that aspect. Hence the 500 index is a synthetic model of the US market performance.",0,0.562,NEGATIVE,0.957

You are just making it more complicated for yourself in the long run. A total market or S&P 500 is already a diverse setup. At your age, I suggest buying 80% S&P 500 or total market and 20% international. If you are investing for retirement in a tax-advantage account, have *automatic deposits set up, rebalance your % annually or quarterly, and ignore what the market is doing.",0,0.538,NEGATIVE,1.0

You will not have 80/20 after a year or at the end of a quarter. I believe my last quarter ended 81.3 / 18.7. It's 80.11/ 19.89 atm but I won't adjust until end of December.",2,0.591,NEGATIVE,1.0
