,"Listed under ticket CDR, CD project red makes video games and owns the online store gog.com. Profits have been lackluster in recent years without a new hit game, but even then reports show increase in profitability. The factors which led me to a purchase are -great demand of Nvidia and AMD cards, almost everything is out of stock -great demand for new consoles. PS5 is out of stock and hard to find. -cyberpunk received great reviews in the summer by journalists testing beta versions. The game will be polished (pun intended) to perfection. I expect lots of 10/10 reviews Q4 profits will be boosted by additional merch which became available and the release of the game in Q4. As new generation console titles are rare, I believe sales momentum will continue in Q1 2021. My exit strategy is after Q1 earnings are released in 2021.","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

Anything but an amazing launch and the price will tank. Especially since you'll then be bag holding for what... 5 years until another release?",0,0.523,0.999,NEGATIVE

This isn't a revolutionary new product & they're not completely changing their business model; so people are just extrapolating from Witcher 3 data. They need to beat expectations, and expectations are sky high.If you buy now you're buying under the assumption they meet or exceed expected sale with huge risk if they don't, but mostly you're buying early for their next release.Also look at their market cap, it's around 9.5 Billion, that's what Ubisoft is worth... ZeniMax which owns Elder Scrolls & Fallout (and much more) was bought my MSFT for $7.5 billion. I love CDPR, Cyberpunk is going to be amazing... but the expectations are simply too high. There are better investments elsewhere IMO.",2,0.545,1.0,NEGATIVE
