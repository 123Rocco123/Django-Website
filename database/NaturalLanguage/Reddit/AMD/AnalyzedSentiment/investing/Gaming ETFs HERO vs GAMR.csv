,Thoughts on these two ETF's? I already hold HERO and I love it but I don't like the lack of exposure to current gen hardware with no AMD or Sony/Microsoft. GAMR seems very broad and sort of like a catch all for the gaming industry. Wondering if anyone has any reasons to prefer one over the other? Not very familiar with ETF's in general and if a very broad ETF is favorable or not. The reason I currently hold HERO vs the other gaming ETF's is that HERO is Canadian and thus I pay no fees trading it on Wealthsimple.,"Hi, welcome to r/investing.
