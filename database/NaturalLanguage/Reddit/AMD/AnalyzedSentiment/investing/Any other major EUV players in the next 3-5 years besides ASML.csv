,"For those that dont know what EUV is.... The most simplified answer is that it is whats allowing the iPhone 13 to be faster than the iPhone 12. We've reached the limit to how powerful we can build microchips using the technology from the previous 10 years. It is simply impossible due to physical limitations. However, ASML builds the machines that companies like Apple, Google, Samsung, AMD, Invidia, and even Intel to a certain extent, use to manufacture their microchips. The latest generation machine launched a few years ago by ASML uses EUV which is a technology that was thought to be impossible to do. ASML figured it out, perfected it, and now is the only company on earth that can make them. The vast majority of electronic devices you have are using microchips built on ASML equipment. Pretty much all new flagship computers and mobile devices are using ASML's new EUV machines. ASML can't even build these EUV machines fast enough despite costing over $150,000,000 each and weighing over 180 tons! It's nuts! So with that said...... Every month that goes by I kick myself for not buying ASML the previous month. The stock just doesn't know what ""down"" means. Obviously this is due to their EUV technology. Is anyone aware of any other realistic competitors to ASML in the EUV market in the next 3-5 years? If another company is able to offer high volume EUV that is either better or cheaper than ASMLs current solution, they will go sky high in value fast. From everything I could research, it seems like there are some hopeful companies out of Japan but nobody seems even close to ASML. If it's true that ASML is still to this day several years ahead of anyone else in EUV, then I'm going to buy every penny of their stock I can afford because it will only go up and up and up and new phones and computers roll out with ever denser chips.","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

It’s not just about their own research, but they also have:Close relations with TSM which allows them to rapidly test and iterate new machines in real-world fab processes. They also get valuable feedback from a high volume manufacturer.Close relations with partners like Zeiss. There are so many complicated parts involved in EUV and every single of those needs to be too notch. Like the lenses must be perfect, the machinery must be perfect, the calibration system must be perfect, the radiation source must be perfect etc.If you want to overtake ASML, you can’t only replicate their technology, but you also have to replicate their networks.",0,0.528,0.856,POSITIVE

So at this point, do you think there is still growth in the asml stock? It seems to keep going up and really I can only see it going up more and more. As new devices roll out in every corner of the market, faster, smaller and more efficient microchips are going to be at the center of that. It seems EUV is the only way that is going to happen so as time goes, more and more companies will find themselves demanding chips from their fabs that can only be made using ASMLs EUV devices. I am guessing that at least for the next 3-5 years, ASML will continue to grow in value as more companies find themselves depending on 7nm and smaller chipsIf this is the case, then now is as good of a time as any to dump some money into it.

,"For those that dont know what EUV is.... The most simplified answer is that it is whats allowing the iPhone 13 to be faster than the iPhone 12. We've reached the limit to how powerful we can build microchips using the technology from the previous 10 years. It is simply impossible due to physical limitations. However, ASML builds the machines that companies like Apple, Google, Samsung, AMD, Invidia, and even Intel to a certain extent, use to manufacture their microchips. The latest generation machine launched a few years ago by ASML uses EUV which is a technology that was thought to be impossible to do. ASML figured it out, perfected it, and now is the only company on earth that can make them. The vast majority of electronic devices you have are using microchips built on ASML equipment. Pretty much all new flagship computers and mobile devices are using ASML's new EUV machines. ASML can't even build these EUV machines fast enough despite costing over $150,000,000 each and weighing over 180 tons! It's nuts! So with that said...... Every month that goes by I kick myself for not buying ASML the previous month. The stock just doesn't know what ""down"" means. Obviously this is due to their EUV technology. Is anyone aware of any other realistic competitors to ASML in the EUV market in the next 3-5 years? If another company is able to offer high volume EUV that is either better or cheaper than ASMLs current solution, they will go sky high in value fast. From everything I could research, it seems like there are some hopeful companies out of Japan but nobody seems even close to ASML. If it's true that ASML is still to this day several years ahead of anyone else in EUV, then I'm going to buy every penny of their stock I can afford because it will only go up and up and up and new phones and computers roll out with ever denser chips.",Atomera as a supplier maybe,0,0.502,0.925,POSITIVE

I have not seen any competition announced. If true, and if the manufacturers dislike standard resists so much they need Lam's, then Lam should see a lot of revenue from this.",0,0.538,0.962,POSITIVE
