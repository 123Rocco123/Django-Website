Getting to the point where I'm taking the W and starting to trim some of this stuff rather than chasing it further. Won't sell out completely of a lot of things, but I'm not going to keep piling into this stuff either. A fair amount of growth to me is starting to feel late innings (or better yet, it's starting to feel 2021-y again a mere 3 years later) and in an attempt to avoid the crowds/traffic, I'm beginning to leave early.I do think that there are opportunities in what's been obliterated, but ""what's hot"" has started to feel increasingly like indiscriminate chasing/FOMO. That can last longer than anyone would expect and good luck to all, but I'd rather look elsewhere at this point.""energy (Nuclear, solar, wind, Oil, Gas, etc.)""Nuclear has already done very well. Solar - particularly residential - got obliterated by high rates then got obliterated again in the last week over regulatory concerns. I think some names are interesting for a bounce, but I don't think that the potential upside is what it once was years ago. We aren't going back to the era of ultra low rates, which was clearly supportive. Regulatory concerns are valid but how valid it's too soon to say.Wind no interest. There are some very good oil/gas companies that are cheap given that energy is once again moderately out of favor.""mining ""No interest really. Too many people have this thing of thinking that a move higher in a commodity is going to be sustained forever. Look at lithium and people were going ""OMG GUYS EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE DRIVING EVS THEREFORE LITHIUM TO THE MOON."" People talk about ""the cure for high prices is high prices"" - lithium ramps, more supply comes online and it heads lower and then on top of that EV demand clearly slows. Look at something like ALB that went from $60's to $320 in the 2020/21 period (also helped by the EV/disruptive growth bubble) and back to the $80's in August this year before bouncing. Commodity plays like that are having to understand the dynamics of the market and be able to get out before something like ALB loses 75% in less than two years. I really don't like things that I think are just ""10 steps forward, 9 steps back"" investments over time - maybe if something is truly obliterated I'll consider nibbling but mostly I just don't care for owning mining cos.""I was thinking of selling some positions and buying tsla""Seems like chasing/FOMO.The portfolio seems like 99% of it is commonly owned tech stocks. It has worked, it may work for a while longer but when it stops, there's a looooottt of people all going off the basically the same investment playbook.",0,0.533,NEGATIVE,1.0
