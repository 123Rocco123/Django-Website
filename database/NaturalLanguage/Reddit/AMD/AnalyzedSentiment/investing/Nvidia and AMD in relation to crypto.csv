Would love to hear your opinions,"Ethereum Classic, which will not go proof of stake.Ah yes, the coin with 2,5% the market cap and coresponding mining revenue from mining will keep GPU mining alive. /sETH goes, 90% or some shit of total GPU mining revenue is gone overnight. That means it can support 1/10th the mining infrastructure while leaving profits at the same level as currently. That means some mining demand might remain as new more efficient generations comes out, but it will be irrelevant for overall GPU demand.Total mining revenue is what determines how large the mining sector can grow. Right now that it ETH for GPUs, and not much else.",3,0.525,0.993,NEGATIVE
