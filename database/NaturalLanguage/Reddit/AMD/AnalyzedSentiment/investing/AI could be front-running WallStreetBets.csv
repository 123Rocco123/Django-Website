,"There is an ETF that makes trades based on artificial intelligence (ticker: AIEQ). The AI combs through mountains of data (expressly including social media and regular news reporting). When I heard about it, I was originally dubious about its ability to beat a relatively efficient market based on searching through this dataset, but I was curious. So I bought a little bit when it debuted, and it didn't do much of anything, and indeed kinda underperformed so I lost patience and sold it. But I remember an AI podcast I heard that talked about machine learning and how early on (with Chess, or Go, or other tests), humans would beat the AI easily. But then over time, AI progressively learned and then became unbeatable. So I took a flyer and bought back into AIEQ in early November and continued to leg into the position, and it continues to do well. I ran a three month chart vs. SPY and Vanguard's Total Stock Index. It is beating both handily. (This is true on longer time periods also, but I didn't own it before November). Moreover, the outperformance seems to be accelerating, which could mean the AI is learning and improving as it goes. That outperformance raised my eyebrows, and I was surprised that this dataset had in fact yielded actionable alpha. Then I heard about wallstreetbets. And then I made the connection - AIEQ may be outperforming because it is reading all the Reddit trade discussion, and is following or perhaps even front-running those trades. If you look at AIEQ's top portfolio positions, they are full of Reddit faves like TSLA, ENPH, SPWR, AMD, ROKU, ETSY, SQ, MRNA, ZS, CRWD, PLUG, etc. I don't know if my theory is correct (the AI trading methodology is a black box), but it's certainly food for thought.","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

It's very true that as time progresses, the effective rate of optimization improves.I've currently been holding WIZ, which is another AI ETF and it's also outperformed the S&P 500.One of the things that I think it will struggle with is looking at qualitative information - which is often why I believe these AI based ETFs attempt to quantify sentiment as a metric.I think I will likely buy some AIEQ or AIIQ as well, because from a philosophical perspective I think they are vastly superior looking at quantitative information and are probably quickly ramping up on qualitative info.",0,0.541,0.997,POSITIVE

Games have a resolution, an end state while the stock market doesn't. How the stock market behaves is always changing too - SPACs are now super popular, we have things like cryptocurrency as a potential asset class, random world events like covid, now retail investors are more active than ever. With this in mind, it's very likely the AI will always be learning and make some mistakes as it encounters new scenarios.I don't think AI will be good at finding those moonshot stocks for a while - they typically require a catalyst that won't be obvious to an AI. They probably will tag along for the ride though.I do think AI will be very good at consistently beating things we always view as benchmarks, like the S&P500.

It doesn't carry the safety of the S&P 500Pretty much every retail investor probably had similar or better returns than the AIs 30% in the last year. A better comparison in my mind would be the actively managed etfs and funds like ARKK, although ARKK to my knowledge is the cream of the crop and also is having an outlier yearBut I do think it has a lot of potential.

At the end of the day passive ETFs are essentially managed by ""dumb"" machines. S&P for example requires large market cap, is profitable, etc. If you fail to meet these requirements, you're kicked out and replaced.In comparison, AI ETFs have fluid and dynamic logic as the market changes.ARK, and other people, have recently been very good at predicting how the world will change. I think this is much, much more difficult for a machine to do than a human.If you want this level from AI, they'd essentially have to have access to databases with things like total addressable markets for everything and be smart enough to figure out when to apply each data (or multiple datasets) for every individual line of business in every company.

If you look at AIEQ's top portfolio positions, they are full of Reddit faves like TSLA, ENPH, SPWR, AMD, ROKU, ETSY, SQ, MRNA, ZS, CRWD, PLUG, etc. I don't know if my theory is correct (the AI trading methodology is a black box), but it's certainly food for thought.","1 day sample size, nice analysis",0,0.52,0.998,POSITIVE
,"There is an ETF that makes trades based on artificial intelligence (ticker: AIEQ). The AI combs through mountains of data (expressly including social media and regular news reporting). When I heard about it, I was originally dubious about its ability to beat a relatively efficient market based on searching through this dataset, but I was curious. So I bought a little bit when it debuted, and it didn't do much of anything, and indeed kinda underperformed so I lost patience and sold it. But I remember an AI podcast I heard that talked about machine learning and how early on (with Chess, or Go, or other tests), humans would beat the AI easily. But then over time, AI progressively learned and then became unbeatable. So I took a flyer and bought back into AIEQ in early November and continued to leg into the position, and it continues to do well. I ran a three month chart vs. SPY and Vanguard's Total Stock Index. It is beating both handily. (This is true on longer time periods also, but I didn't own it before November). Moreover, the outperformance seems to be accelerating, which could mean the AI is learning and improving as it goes.
