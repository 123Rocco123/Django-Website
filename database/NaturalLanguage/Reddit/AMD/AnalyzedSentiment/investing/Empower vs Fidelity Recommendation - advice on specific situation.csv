,"Hi, My fiancé (35) is considering transferring the majority of her retirement funds from Fidelity to Empower. Empower is her current employer 401K. There is around $9K in that account. Currently she has a rollover IRA (rolled over last year from a prior employer) as well as a Roth IRA with Fidelity. Here is the breakdown of those accounts - Rollover IRA – 79,839.18 in cash AAPL – 1 @ Cost basis of 146.93 FARMX – 156.88 @ avg cost basis of 18.33 FBGRX – 10.572 @ avg cost basis of 177.36 FITLX – 68.726 @ avg cost basis of 20.01 FMEIX – 85.307 @ avg cost basis of 17.29 FPURX – 58.806 @ avg cost basis of 23.38 FSKAX – 0.662 @ avg cost basis of 113.29 FVAL – 66.666 @ avg cost basis of 47.89 FXAIX – 13.102 @ avg cost basis of 154.56 FXNAX – 21.06 @ avg cost basis of 10.68 FZILX – 161.578 @ avg cost basis of 11.53 FZROX – 117.833 @ avg cost basis of 15.91 GOOGL – 20 @ avg cost basis of 14.08 MSFT – 2 @ avg cost basis of 288.18 SCHD – 13.926 @ avg cost basis of 78.57 Roth IRA – 3,932.68 in total investments spread across companies like META, NVDA, WYNN, RRR, ASO, AMD, DIS, etc. Down about $145 all time. A random $800 from an older 401K that needs to be rolled over. The main question she is wondering if she should roll both Fidelity accounts into the Empower My Total Retirement program. She had a meeting with them and they said that if she did there would be no advisory fee. The plan documents for their 401K say there is a quarterly fee of 0.1125%. The Premier Retirement Advisory services has a fee of 0.50%/year plus another 0.4% for the next 150K.She is looking for some input on a few questions – Is the my total retirement annual the same as the advisory fee they said they would waive? Is there a transaction fee to buy/sell even if the advisory is managing the transactions? There seems to be charges for each transaction in her 401K and she is currently signed up for the My Total Retirement Program. I think she would need to liquidate the Fidelity zero funds if she moved to Empower and that would be a taxable event. Is that accurate? Most importantly, would it be worth it to move the Fidelity funds to Empower and have them manage it? And if it is not worth it, should she stop the My Total Retirement program at Empower to save on fees and just keep running the self directed 401K? My idea with recommending the Fidelity funds to her initially was the zero expense ratio for some of the funds above. TIA for any advice.","Question I would ask my self is what does empower offer that fidelity doesn't right now. She would also have to liquidate her zero cost funds as they can't be held anywhere outside of Fidelity. If its all in IRA shouldn't be taxable, but I still fail to see what empower is offering her with those high fees that you couldn't do at Fidelity?Those fees look to be kind of high to me , so not sure I would want to be doing anything with empower if it were me.",0,0.519,1.0,NEGATIVE

She will keep the employer 401k obviously, but I don’t see the advantage of consolidating everything into Empower Premier Advisory and adding another fee on top of everything. They said they would waive the advisory fee supposedly (she is confirming), but I am not getting why they would when even the docs on their website say you need a lot more in your account to get even a small fee. Plus I think there are transaction fees and maintenance fees. They said they can auto rebalance and shift investment goals with a personal advisor, but i fee like keeping what she has with fidelity already and just continuing to DCA would save fees in the long run. I think she feels that since she is still down around $1000 overall so far this year that she is not getting the best value/returns. I realize we are talking months compared to years of just DCA here.",1,0.54,0.999,NEGATIVE

TIA for any advice.","If she wants to keep things simple at fidelity with IRA I personally would just tell her to throw it in an index tdf and call it a day, all those extra fees empower is piling on will start adding up. Even a robo advisor could do auto rebalancing I believe for a fraction of the price, I am not sure how difficult auto rebalancing would be though. Log in twice a year to rebalance I don't think you really need to do much more than that.If you use a TDF takes money out of your account automatically and buys one fund and you are almost 100% diversified and you never have to do anything other than just rebalance.If she is going to go through a personal advisor at empower I am going to almost guarantee that they will try to get her into High ER active funds, and we all know how active funds are long term .",2,0.522,1.0,NEGATIVE

,"Hi, My fiancé (35) is considering transferring the majority of her retirement funds from Fidelity to Empower. Empower is her current employer 401K. There is around $9K in that account. Currently she has a rollover IRA (rolled over last year from a prior employer) as well as a Roth IRA with Fidelity. Here is the breakdown of those accounts - Rollover IRA – 79,839.18 in cash AAPL – 1 @ Cost basis of 146.93 FARMX – 156.88 @ avg cost basis of 18.33 FBGRX – 10.572 @ avg cost basis of 177.36 FITLX – 68.726 @ avg cost basis of 20.01 FMEIX – 85.307 @ avg cost basis of 17.29 FPURX – 58.806 @ avg cost basis of 23.38 FSKAX – 0.662 @ avg cost basis of 113.29 FVAL – 66.666 @ avg cost basis of 47.89 FXAIX – 13.102 @ avg cost basis of 154.56 FXNAX – 21.06 @ avg cost basis of 10.68 FZILX – 161.578 @ avg cost basis of 11.53 FZROX – 117.833 @ avg cost basis of 15.91 GOOGL – 20 @ avg cost basis of 14.08 MSFT – 2 @ avg cost basis of 288.18 SCHD – 13.926 @ avg cost basis of 78.57 Roth IRA – 3,932.68 in total investments spread across companies like META, NVDA, WYNN, RRR, ASO, AMD, DIS, etc. Down about $145 all time. A random $800 from an older 401K that needs to be rolled over. The main question she is wondering if she should roll both Fidelity accounts into the Empower My Total Retirement program. She had a meeting with them and they said that if she did there would be no advisory fee. The plan documents for their 401K say there is a quarterly fee of 0.1125%. The Premier Retirement Advisory services has a fee of 0.50%/year plus another 0.4% for the next 150K.She is looking for some input on a few questions – Is the my total retirement annual the same as the advisory fee they said they would waive? Is there a transaction fee to buy/sell even if the advisory is managing the transactions? There seems to be charges for each transaction in her 401K and she is currently signed up for the My Total Retirement Program. I think she would need to liquidate the Fidelity zero funds if she moved to Empower and that would be a taxable event. Is that accurate? Most importantly, would it be worth it to move the Fidelity funds to Empower and have them manage it? And if it is not worth it, should she stop the My Total Retirement program at Empower to save on fees and just keep running the self directed 401K? My idea with recommending the Fidelity funds to her initially was the zero expense ratio for some of the funds above. TIA for any advice.",Which would you consililidate? FBGRX/FPURX/FXAIX? Anything else?,2,0.504,0.99,NEGATIVE
