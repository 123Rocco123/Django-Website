It might be fundamental to why QE policy was arguably over utilized. Seems like there has to eventually be some kind of fallout from it. I don’t know what it will look like, or if it will even be particularly painful, but it seems like some kind of chicken has to come to roost eventually.Like, if most stocks are trading at 1,000,000x earnings they might as well be crypto. Im staunchly in the “investing is different from gambling” camp, but when one looks at algorithmic trading and meme stock retail volume humming in the shadow of arguably absurd valuations, well, it just feels like it’s a harder position to defend than it used to be.Please correct and berate me if any of that is stupid, I’m not particularly well read in this stuff these days.",2,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE

The Federal Reserve is one of the entities that oversees banking and controls monetary policy. So in reality they do not have any specific control over ""the market"", and they are only one part of the economic tools that the government uses to manage the economy. Powell is chair of the Fed board of governors, and these 7 people come together with President's of various Fed banks located in major US cities to run a 12-person board called the Federal Open Market Committee. They meet frequently and make projections for where they think the economy is headed, and discuss what levers need manipulated to keep money circulating and the markets open and moving, and to keep the currency stable and prevent excessive inflation. Deciding the fed funds rate i.e. the interest rate is probably the most important part of their toolkit. These 12 people decide what the fed funds rate will be - technically they have voting powers and Powell/the chair is just one of 12 votes. In practice I believe he usually gives his recommendation and then they decide if they agree or not. Occasionally someone dissents but I doubt it is ever the majority. I do not know the specific voting structure or its history but usually they present a united front and seem to make unanimous decisions.Powell is just the one who speaks for them. And as chair, he IS appointed by the President (and approved by the Senate) - though often times it's not really a political decision, and Presidents have had major disagreements with their own selections in the past, partly because as politicians they probably do not grasp how a given appointee's political inclinations necessarily match up with how they will govern monetary policy and banking oversight. Trump appointed Powell and didn't like him - but I think it's not clear if he would have had the power to remove him. And even it he had, the FOMC may have kept making the same decisions anyway.Ever since 2008, the Fed's power and role has expanded dramatically. I think they don't even necessarily want that, IMO it has primarily been a way for politicians who do not understand the economy to essentially delegate part of the role of managing the economy to a separate entity, who they can place blame on whenever it's convenient. Presidents are not economists. Technically the President's only role in this context is to appoint people to manage the Fed, and to approve budgets (i.e. fiscal policy) that has been approved by Congress. These days, the bureaucrats within each agency draft a budget, send it to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which compiles a large draft and sends it to Congress. Congress makes some minor bullshit edits that mostly involve slinging money to their home district and singling out random non-factors that are solely political (i.e. military $ that are available for soldiers' healthcare to get abortions, etc.) because they also do not understand the economy.Because none of these people understand the economy and things keep getting bigger and more complex, the Fed is seen as the face of economic governance. And Powell, as chairman of the board, is their representative. So for all these reasons, people now think he as an individual is way more powerful than he actually is. He certainly has a ton of influence, but if his decisions went in opposition to the prevailing attitude of all the economists and bankers throughout the Federal Reserve system, he would be out of the job.Of course this discussion is only really regarding monetary policy, when it could definitely be argued that fiscal policy is a more direct intervention in markets and meddling in the stock market. That's where the debt ceiling hiking and massive trillion+ $ deficits are being approved. That all has a huge impact on the economy and the Fed is quite literally powerless to do anything other than give subtle hints that they think it's really, really dumb and that we should raise taxes. But they cannot stop the American people and their representatives from digging us into an uncharted and increasingly problematic territory via insane federal debt.I think contrary to OPs suggestion of his own omniscience and our sheepleness, many serious investors are well aware that all of our fates are tied to the US economy and that many fortunes have been built on QE policies of the last 15 years, and yeah if it crashes and burns or stagnates forever then so will much of our retirement money. Nothing in particular I can do to control that.tl;dr the Fed is governed by a board that rules mostly on consensus. If Powell's decisions were contrary to the attitudes prevailing within the Federal Reserve system, he probably would not be around. And OP is not a genius - many investors are aware that QE and fiscal stimulus have driven huge gains post-2008.",2,0.515,1.0,NEGATIVE

The typical mainstream criticism is that the fed actually did too little during the great depression. The pro-interventionist usually argues it was the fiscal policy of government spending that ""helped"" stop the depression.The anti-interventionist would argue it was government intervention and monetary expansion post WWI to late 20s that caused the financial bubbles, over leverage, and malinvestment that lead to the great depression in the first place. Where capital was greatly misallocated due to market distortions.Unfortunately, this is not a hard science, there is simply no way to definitively know whether ""human suffering"" would have better / worse under a more free market or harder monetary system. Especially because there is was a marked shift in fed policy after the start of the depression, where the fed basically gave up, they shifted from highly active policy changes to more fixed policy due to not understanding why their policies were not effective at preventing the crash.

The gold standard sounds great on paper but puts massive strain on economies when they go into recession and can exacerbate the deflationary spiral B) the market is a collection of shares in companies being traded for whatever the market deems acceptable. You can scream from the top of your lungs about what SHOULD be the value of a particular stock/investment/item, but you’re part of the market. If the market says you’re wrong (even if you’re just early) then you’re wrong. C) the FED put is real. I’m not at all saying there is some secret government conspiracy to pick winners and losers, but I think anyone who is intellectually honest with themselves could not envision a world where the US central bank would allow the US stock market as a whole to collapse. There are simply too many people invested to ever think that the central bank would just sit by idly.Now, if you will notice I didn’t disagree with you. I think most of what I said would line up with what you already know. My point is that you WANT THIS. Please read some history of the US economy BEFORE the FED was formed. It was a hot steaming pile of shit. Banks issued their OWN currency, backed by the reserves (or sometimes the lack there of) of the bank. Banks would collapse and currency would become worthless within a few days. People who put their life savings in a bank or had their mortgage with a bank were suddenly forced to grapple with the fact that the bank had collapsed.I’m not saying that our system is perfect because it isn’t. We have a bunch of issues facing humanity as we try to transition to a more stable economic model, but this system didn’t pop up overnight.

The fed is saying loudly, and clearly, (8 times a year is how often they meet and adjust rates btw) that the economy is on the train tracks and that there is reason to believe that cutting rates, to say 4%-4.25%, would be reasonable.“One man wields so much control” is incorrect. There are 12 voting members on the FOMC. Powell may have the strongest voice but the unanimity of all 12 members is what sets rates.“Elephant in the room”. Fact is that there hasn’t been stimulus in over 2 years (or thereabout). QE? You’re kidding me, right? The fed has been on an extreme tightening cycle for the past 18 months, they’ve tapered their balance sheet and, in conjunction, the treasury has been printing less money. (That’s literally the definition of quantitative tightening, the opposite of what you’re arguing). I would contend, sure, if the fed doesn’t cut OR if inflation increases that they could derail the market as a new variable has to be priced in.Markets go up, markets go down (I’ve been around since 2007 and, yes, markets go down, crisis happens, geopolitical events, pandemics) but, fundamentally, earnings are strong. Cash positions with corporations are well off and the consumer is in an ok state.I mean no disrespect but how old are you? My guess is that you can’t be more than 21.

If you wanted to comment that the government spending $1.6 trillion more per year than they bring in (for context, the US brings in about $5.0 trillion and are spending $6.6 trillion) and you are worried about the sustainability AND the stimulating effects that brings, then I am all ears and, in general terms would agree with you, but that's not the argument you made above.Lastly, you ask ""Does it sound normal"", the answer is, again in generalities, yes. The Fed raises rates and lowers rates. The FED has always increased and tapered their balance sheet. The Treasury has always increased and decreased the money supply, depending on economic conditions and world conditions.This isn't to say that markets only go up, but, what I would say to you is remember 2022? That entire year was painful, the market did nothing of substance and consistently, and constantly it felt like, traded down.I suspect you weren't around in 2008-2009 but that one was a fun one too. I remember the talk on business shows being how the world was about to come to an end, from a fiscal policy perspsective.As folks from the early 2000's if markets go down, etc...etc...We are in a bull run right now. I own the SPY (as I have since 2007). The reality is that markets go up, markets go down. The difference now is that governments, world-wide, are more active, these days, in extinguishing significant consequential fires than those in the 20's,30's, 40's, etc...",2,0.529,0.99,NEGATIVE

Many countries have a higher Debt to GDP ratios than the US, like Japan, Italy, France, Spain, and likely China though they don’t really disclose those numbers. You should also read what people are saying here about JPow because your assessment that he’s whispering about rate cuts to the market is incorrect, it will likely happen and that can be seen due to a variety of economic indicators, and he indicated it may make sense at some point, but he continues to try to temper expectations which is probably what we need in order to accomplish a soft landing. You also should understand that the US economy and the stock market is constantly evolving and we adjust to these evolutions over time. We’ve had an energy crisis in the 70s, we had the Great Recession which blew a hole in the US economy, we had the Great Depression as well as multiple wars, and other tough times and we have gotten through everything. Lastly, you need to understand that the way the global economy is structured, with the ability to trade paper for goods and services, is built on the idea that our currencies are worth something even though intrinsically they aren’t and the most important currency of all is the USD. You realizing everything is a built on nothing might seem like you’re outthinking everyone but you’re not. The system that we live in is reality. It might not make sense but it is the system everyone has bought into and it represents the rules everyone plays by. Upon this system are 250 years of law that is the backbone of civil society. The alternative to this system is anarchy. Given this, people will continue to play by the rules of this reality.

Or CHF!I think a lot of people agree that the fiscal situation has several potential outcomes, mostly bad. But that a very big problem.I don't blame the Fed too much--it's fiscal policy that most out of control and the Fed doesn't control that. As for investing choices on individual stocks or sectors, earnings do matter, though obviously within the context of macro developments.As for broad index funds I think we're all waiting nervously to see how that passive investing strategy works out with ever-diminishing ""price discovery"" in the system and extremely high concentration in the same few names.GLTA!",0,0.517,1.0,NEGATIVE

But i hope to at least start the conversation","The problem with discussing fiscal policy is that a good portion believe that the people in government right now, know what they are doing. Janet Yellen has no clue what inflation is much less make policy on it. Jerome Powell has managed somehow to decrease the rate of inflation even though the prices are still going up. So of course things have to be propped up so the legally blind can keep leading the willfully blind. Hell 1st day of Biden proved that he had no idea of economic functions when he went scorched earth on any and all of Trump's policies. The economy only went belly up because he listened to people who had no clue in an effort to save peoples lives. Only thing you can do is get back to the starting point by reversing what has been currently done wrong. But until you replace the people who are either corrupt or their ego is bigger than Trump's, it will never happen.As to yelling into the void, we hear you, we sympathize with you, we feel your frustration but the only way is to literally pay attention and vote in people who show they know what they are doing and not putting into place people who talk a good game. If you manage to get rid of the corrupted not by just explaining what people did wrong with no consequence but by the full extent of the law up to and including treason, if you make it all proven result based or manage to say merit without getting eradicated by activist or people who just want their seat at the table of power at any costs, you'll have a country that is running on all cylinders again.Edit: because i said some mean words that got it removed the first time.",0,0.512,1.0,NEGATIVE
