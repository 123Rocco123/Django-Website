,"Why all the hate recently towards amd? They seem to have a cyclic balance sheet, is that it? Is there someone else in the sector that looks stronger? Otherwise they seem poised to do well with their new tech, I mean look at the 5-5600x at $300, it crushes intel.","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

They need to do exceptionally well to justify their current price while Intel does exceptionally poorly. That aside, acquisitions are tricky and if they aren't done right then they can turn into a dumpster fire. This acquisition is funded by AMD's investors through stock dilution which is probably why AMD is going down. AMD has a market cap of $89bln and they are going to issue new stock worth $35bln in order to buy a company valued at $29bln. AMD hasn't explained well why they are paying a premium for the acquisition, so that may be what it comes down to.",0,0.606,1.0,NEGATIVE

Being a fairly established company in an established industry (semiconductors), I wouldn't expect them to have the same potential growth or volatility as a pure growth company like Tesla, Square, or Fastly. However, they've clearly done well in 2020, and the market is trying to figure out just how much potential they have in the future.",1,0.61,0.991,NEGATIVE

Sales usually don’t look great if you have nothing to sell, but I bet the market won’t care and until someone besides nvidia comes along to compete in gpu space or intel in cpu they can get away with poor management.",1,0.557,1.0,NEGATIVE

The only problem I’ve seen is that they could be acquiring Xilinx at a inflated value. But long term there’s not really much to be concerned about. The share price is a bit weird but the entire market is a bit weird.,0,0.546,1.0,NEGATIVE
