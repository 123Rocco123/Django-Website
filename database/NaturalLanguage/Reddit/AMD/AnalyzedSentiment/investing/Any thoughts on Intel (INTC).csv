You either make something new and exciting or people will buy your competitor's product.Let's be real, most people would be fine with last gen stuff. Like even for gaming, 10600K will be good for many years, especially at high resolutions where GPUs can't drive high enough frame rates for it to matter.But that's not how it works, does it? Zen 3 comes out next month that's a few percent faster. The thing is, for competitive gamers who play on low settings on 1080p, the CPU can make a huge difference (since they all have at least 240Hz monitors). They will all run out and buy the Zen 3 CPUs.Basically what will happen is Zen 3 will become the ""I can afford the best"" CPU. Intel CPUs will be viewed as budget options.What happens to your margins when you become the ""budget"" brand? By next year, the ""Intel inside"" sticker on a computer will mean ""I can't afford AMD""",1,0.541,1.0,NEGATIVE
