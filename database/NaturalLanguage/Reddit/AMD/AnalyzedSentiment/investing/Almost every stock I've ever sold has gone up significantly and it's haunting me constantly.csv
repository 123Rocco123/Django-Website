Honestly it’s easy to correct this habit. Just set target allocations and balance around that. Let’s say your target allocation for TSLA was $10k. You buy $10k worth (or ladder in, or w/e), and hold it. If it shoots up significantly (50% or more), you can adjust the position. Adjusting would be returning to target allocation, which in this case is $10k. So it goes to $15k, you lock in $5k profit, and continue to ride it out. If it hits $15k again, you take another $5k profit. If it drops to $8k, you buy $2k more.

For example, Tesla still has amazing growth - you keep thinking that you sold out too early? Think of it another way: you do your DD on it and if you don’t buy it now, you’ll have missed out on a way better opportunity for the next ten years.Once you start training your mind to focus on future thinking, it will retrain your neural pathways to stop focusing on backward thinking.You made a mistake...stop repeating the mistake! Stare it dead in the eye, promise yourself that you will quit wallowing, get back up again, figure out what you keep doing wrong (newsflash: it’s selling for short term gains out of anxiety, is what you’re doing wrong) and hold for the long term.I also think you’re tying a lot of your worth as a trader/investor to getting stocks at a ‘low’ price. I think you should reality test this. Once you’ve done your DD on a stock and want to add it to your portfolio, buy it at whatever price the market sets. Leave it for a few weeks. Does it feel bad that you paid more than a dollar for it? Probably not.I would also consider finding an alternative way to make money in relation to your family obligations, so it can release the pressure. Find a skill and advertise yourself on Fiverr, for example. Keep yourself productive and stop letting the market control you. You control your wealth, my friend.",0,0.532,0.997,NEGATIVE

Any advice from someone who has been here before is appreciated edit: basically all were held >1year, I do not day or swing trad",You are looking at this all wrong. I did the same thing in ‘93. Bought Apple and 2 months later Steve Jobs triumphantly returns. 4 months after that I sold it all for 100% profit.At the time I was a baller investor. I made a killing. Looking back today ‘I’m an idiot’ by your logic.BUT I also took that money with my luck and skills to identify other winning stocks. My other investments outpaced what I would have made holding Apple.Sounds like you have a good eye for investments so keep it up and don’t look back. There are always opportunities up ahead. If you’re too busy looking behind you might miss them. Get over the lost opportunity and get on identifying the next.,0,0.527,0.998,NEGATIVE
