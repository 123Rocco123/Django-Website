,"Always heard thst growth stocks are great during bull markets but as soon as there is a downturn they crash and burn. Looking back at March, volatile stocks like Fastly, Cloudflare only lost around 30-50% nothing massive, amazon and Tesla barely lost anything and only dropped back a few months in gains. Now it was obviously a fast and smaller correction but the gains really seems to make up for the risk a lot. I've been holding AMD, Nvidia and similar growth stocks for years and I just have a hard time to see why I shouldn't just keep with growth investing despite all the warnings from people.","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

You don't need to look back to the dotcom crash to see the evidence, it also happened in the late 2018 correction.Growth stocks are what is called ""high beta"". They will change price in both directions more heavily. This time around was an extreme anomaly in how it favored the high beta names and they actually had inverse correlations to the broad market / SP500 / Dow for a period of time.That said, I think this time around has proven just how freaking resilient these big tech businesses are too. They grow rain or shine. I do wonder if this will mean they hold their price better in the next sell off too.",1,0.551,0.938,NEGATIVE

I know how much I was down from the peak in Feb to bottom in Mar. Not fun, but the remainder of the year has been fantastic.When I was buying into the March decline, I expected that there would be a 1-2 year period of gradual recovery and I'd eventually look back and be pleased with the purchases. I did not expect growth to basically ramp higher for the next several months and have the kind of year that's rarely seen. Me:https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DbBOE9pWkAAJDlx.jpgI think the issue becomes when things get too crowded. I don't think that this is ""dot com all over again"", but I do think that there is way too much money flooding into anything ""disruptive growth"" - ARKK is the largest actively managed ETF in the world now and about half that AUM has come in the last 10 weeks. Aggressive growth is overheated at best and a total mania/""buy at any price"" frenzy (anything EV-related) at worst.I'm very much a fan of growth investing, but I think there's too many people fishing in the ""hypergrowth"" pond and it's time to look elsewhere for the time being. This kind of year for growth where you have some growth funds up 135%+ is not normal and those expecting this sort of year to be repeated are likely to be disappointed.",0,0.563,0.999,NEGATIVE

TSLA was down nearly 2/3's from it's prior all time highs at one point. And a 30 to 50 percent drop IS massive.That said, I do agree with your point that there can be a lot less risk in growth stocks at certain times.
