,"S&P 500 forward price to earnings ratios are at the highest they've been since the tech bubble. This may lead to the question- are we in a bubble? One way of valuing the true value of a stock is how much in earnings it will produce in the future. Present earnings are worth more than future earnings. Generally, a discount rate is used, which is based on treasury yields, but at a higher interest rate to compensate for the risk of owning equities. Historically, the S&P 500 earnings yield has often closely tracked the 10 year treasury yield, because earnings are expected to grow over time, providing further upside potential, whereas treasuries pay a fixed rate. https://www.yardeni.com/pub/valuationfed.pdf This hasn't been the case in current years. Currently, the S&P500's forward earnings yield is 4.68%, vs a 1.53% treasury yield. Contrast this with the '99 tech bubble, where treasury yields were much higher than the S&P500 earnings yield prior to the crash. The big risk is of course rising treasury yields as the fed tapers, and eventually raises benchmark rates. Rising treasury yields make bonds more attractive relative to current equity prices, which can lead to a decline if earnings aren't growing. Fortunately, there is a way you can hedge against this risk. During periods of rising interest rates and inflation, ""Value"" stocks usually outperform ""growth"" stocks. This is because earnings are discounted based on current interest rates. Because interest rates are at historical lows, companies like Tesla, Roblox, Rivian, Lucid Motors are valued at extremely high valuations. This is because when you use a discount rate of 1-2%, future earnings are worth very close to present earnings. With a discount rate of 2%, earnings in 30 years are worth 55% of present earnings. However, if you raise that discount rate to 7% due to higher treasury yields, earnings 30 years from now are worth just 11% of present earnings! On the contrary, value stocks like Intel are currently very cheap. In this market, no one wants to own ""Dinosaur"" companies that aren't growing. They would rather own the companies they expect to be bigger in 30 years, like AMD, Nvidia, etc. And with a 1-2% discount rate, the math checks out. When interest rates rise substantially, if they do, growth stocks that depend on low rates to justify their valuation will get hit HARD, with as much as 80% downside. Value stocks will be hit as well as their future earnings are discounted further, but not nearly to the same extent that growth stocks do, since they have high present earnings. Personally, my portfolio is tilted very high towards value stocks and profitable stocks. I hold Fidelity Large Cap Value and Fidelity Small Cap value, and Fidelity Real Estate, as well as VYM and VIG as an indirect way to factor tilt towards profitable stocks. Of course, stocks always carry market risk. A recession can drive a crash due to lower earnings, as it did in 2009, and in 2020. If you are investing for the short term, it may be smart to avoid having too much in equities.","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

I'm often frustrated when people point at various price ratios as an indicator of impending doom because they ignore one important thing - the value of money.If a currency is being devalued, prices WILL rise by definition because we measure price in currency. When the price of everything goes up simultaneously, that doesn't mean the assets became more valuable- it means what they are measured against, the currency , became less valuable. Therefore it is pointless to look at historical ratios unless you adjust for the value of money.",0,0.522,0.996,POSITIVE

In other words, while it is a very popular metric, there are serious theoretical flaws in the Fed Model. Empirical results support this conclusion.I think the argument here is actually a bull one- stocks can be worth more because their earnings rise with inflation, whereas the yield on a long term bond stays the same until maturity.Long-term expected real stock returns are low when starting P/Es are high and vice versa, regardless of starting nominal interest rates.This is true, but it's a matter of most efficient deployment of capital. I think it is correct to assume that real stock market returns will be low going forward, because of high P/E. However, the problem is that there isn't a competing asset that produces better returns- bonds will return even less.Unlike a lot of people, I'm not expecting the stock market to return 10% like it has historically. I think a 4% return over the next 1-2 decades is actually quite likely, given current multiples. This might sound bad, but when the alternative is 2% nominal returns from 30 year treasury bonds, or cash that is guaranteed to lose value in real terms, it makes more sense.There are a lot of solid companies trading at low P/E ratios. If you filter out unprofitable companies, the stock market has some great opportunities.",1,0.547,0.999,NEGATIVE

One way of valuing the true value of a stock is how much in earnings it will produce in the future. Present earnings are worth more than future earnings. Generally, a discount rate is used, which is based on treasury yields, but at a higher interest rate to compensate for the risk of owning equities. Historically, the S&P 500 earnings yield has often closely tracked the 10 year treasury yield, because earnings are expected to grow over time, providing further upside potential, whereas treasuries pay a fixed rate. https://www.yardeni.com/pub/valuationfed.pdf This hasn't been the case in current years. Currently, the S&P500's forward earnings yield is 4.68%, vs a 1.53% treasury yield. Contrast this with the '99 tech bubble, where treasury yields were much higher than the S&P500 earnings yield prior to the crash. The big risk is of course rising treasury yields as the fed tapers, and eventually raises benchmark rates. Rising treasury yields make bonds more attractive relative to current equity prices, which can lead to a decline if earnings aren't growing. Fortunately, there is a way you can hedge against this risk. During periods of rising interest rates and inflation, ""Value"" stocks usually outperform ""growth"" stocks. This is because earnings are discounted based on current interest rates. Because interest rates are at historical lows, companies like Tesla, Roblox, Rivian, Lucid Motors are valued at extremely high valuations. This is because when you use a discount rate of 1-2%, future earnings are worth very close to present earnings. With a discount rate of 2%, earnings in 30 years are worth 55% of present earnings. However, if you raise that discount rate to 7% due to higher treasury yields, earnings 30 years from now are worth just 11% of present earnings! On the contrary, value stocks like Intel are currently very cheap. In this market, no one wants to own ""Dinosaur"" companies that aren't growing. They would rather own the companies they expect to be bigger in 30 years, like AMD, Nvidia, etc. And with a 1-2% discount rate, the math checks out. When interest rates rise substantially, if they do, growth stocks that depend on low rates to justify their valuation will get hit HARD, with as much as 80% downside. Value stocks will be hit as well as their future earnings are discounted further, but not nearly to the same extent that growth stocks do, since they have high present earnings.

,"S&P 500 forward price to earnings ratios are at the highest they've been since the tech bubble. This may lead to the question- are we in a bubble? One way of valuing the true value of a stock is how much in earnings it will produce in the future. Present earnings are worth more than future earnings. Generally, a discount rate is used, which is based on treasury yields, but at a higher interest rate to compensate for the risk of owning equities. Historically, the S&P 500 earnings yield has often closely tracked the 10 year treasury yield, because earnings are expected to grow over time, providing further upside potential, whereas treasuries pay a fixed rate. https://www.yardeni.com/pub/valuationfed.pdf This hasn't been the case in current years. Currently, the S&P500's forward earnings yield is 4.68%, vs a 1.53% treasury yield. Contrast this with the '99 tech bubble, where treasury yields were much higher than the S&P500 earnings yield prior to the crash. The big risk is of course rising treasury yields as the fed tapers, and eventually raises benchmark rates. Rising treasury yields make bonds more attractive relative to current equity prices, which can lead to a decline if earnings aren't growing. Fortunately, there is a way you can hedge against this risk. During periods of rising interest rates and inflation, ""Value"" stocks usually outperform ""growth"" stocks. This is because earnings are discounted based on current interest rates. Because interest rates are at historical lows, companies like Tesla, Roblox, Rivian, Lucid Motors are valued at extremely high valuations. This is because when you use a discount rate of 1-2%, future earnings are worth very close to present earnings. With a discount rate of 2%, earnings in 30 years are worth 55% of present earnings. However, if you raise that discount rate to 7% due to higher treasury yields, earnings 30 years from now are worth just 11% of present earnings! On the contrary, value stocks like Intel are currently very cheap. In this market, no one wants to own ""Dinosaur"" companies that aren't growing. They would rather own the companies they expect to be bigger in 30 years, like AMD, Nvidia, etc. And with a 1-2% discount rate, the math checks out. When interest rates rise substantially, if they do, growth stocks that depend on low rates to justify their valuation will get hit HARD, with as much as 80% downside. Value stocks will be hit as well as their future earnings are discounted further, but not nearly to the same extent that growth stocks do, since they have high present earnings.

That last part is very difficult for people, though. I've had many a thread where it's near impossible to get it into peoples' heads that what they're investing in has no definable value, or that it is extremely overvalued. People keep conflating speculation and stories with real earnings and cash flow. It's just sad, because this is literally the same snake oil gambit that's been run on ""investors"" for over 100 years.

Again, an understanding of history tells us as much. Most people buying these kind of stocks have done no historical research into what happens to them during downturns, because, well, what downturn? I don't wanna think about that. Everything is green right now, and I'm going to continue to operate on the assumption that everything always will be. Or at the very least, I'm going to operate on the assumption that, as a newbie investor, I can totally handle an 80% wipeout of my investments, because from the 5000 foot view, supported by those aforementioned ""stories,"" a potential 5-10 bagger is worth it.If you are investing for the short term, it may be smart to avoid having too much in equities.As a value investor, there is no short term investing, unless you're forced into a sale by a massive, unexplained increase in prices into overvalued territory. But I agree that the current broad market environment should always be considered when trying to determine how much to allocate to equities. Graham counseled a 50/50 portfolio in the early 70s just before the major crash that ensued, noting that valuations were relatively high at the time.

The most undervalued is VIAC which reportedly has been hijacked by hedge fund short sellers manipulating it downward despite plenty of good news for the actual company in the real world. Two others are the big telcos T and VZ, both very cheap with large dividends. JUst a buyer's strike for the last 3 months or so. Then there is SWKS, a big Apple supplier and also diversified chip company. Maybe the cheapest high-end chip company. All four of these have been bad losers recently, but IMHO all are now coiled springs. I al down 100 K on paper with these but if I had cash I would buy them all now without fear. Meanwhile 90% of my money has always been in AAPL and today is a great day for AAPL holders, and because AAPL's PE is still 30% lower than inferior company MSFT's, I recommend that as well.",0,0.565,0.686,NEGATIVE
,"S&P 500 forward price to earnings ratios are at the highest they've been since the tech bubble. This may lead to the question- are we in a bubble? One way of valuing the true value of a stock is how much in earnings it will produce in the future. Present earnings are worth more than future earnings. Generally, a discount rate is used, which is based on treasury yields, but at a higher interest rate to compensate for the risk of owning equities. Historically, the S&P 500 earnings yield has often closely tracked the 10 year treasury yield, because earnings are expected to grow over time, providing further upside potential, whereas treasuries pay a fixed rate. https://www.yardeni.com/pub/valuationfed.pdf This hasn't been the case in current years. Currently, the S&P500's forward earnings yield is 4.68%, vs a 1.53% treasury yield. Contrast this with the '99 tech bubble, where treasury yields were much higher than the S&P500 earnings yield prior to the crash. The big risk is of course rising treasury yields as the fed tapers, and eventually raises benchmark rates. Rising treasury yields make bonds more attractive relative to current equity prices, which can lead to a decline if earnings aren't growing. Fortunately, there is a way you can hedge against this risk. During periods of rising interest rates and inflation, ""Value"" stocks usually outperform ""growth"" stocks. This is because earnings are discounted based on current interest rates. Because interest rates are at historical lows, companies like Tesla, Roblox, Rivian, Lucid Motors are valued at extremely high valuations. This is because when you use a discount rate of 1-2%, future earnings are worth very close to present earnings. With a discount rate of 2%, earnings in 30 years are worth 55% of present earnings. However, if you raise that discount rate to 7% due to higher treasury yields, earnings 30 years from now are worth just 11% of present earnings! On the contrary, value stocks like Intel are currently very cheap. In this market, no one wants to own ""Dinosaur"" companies that aren't growing. They would rather own the companies they expect to be bigger in 30 years, like AMD, Nvidia, etc. And with a 1-2% discount rate, the math checks out. When interest rates rise substantially, if they do, growth stocks that depend on low rates to justify their valuation will get hit HARD, with as much as 80% downside. Value stocks will be hit as well as their future earnings are discounted further, but not nearly to the same extent that growth stocks do, since they have high present earnings.

Not just are they trading at a 6.72 price to earnings ratio, but their streaming services have been growing a lot, which helps protect them against the decline of cable television. Overall they seem very cheap in the current market.T and VZ seem solid too, but my fear is these companies can't really grow earnings much more than inflation unless their market share grows.

This is because when you use a discount rate of 1-2%, future earnings are worth very close to present earnings. With a discount rate of 2%, earnings in 30 years are worth 55% of present earnings. However, if you raise that discount rate to 7% due to higher treasury yields, earnings 30 years from now are worth just 11% of present earnings! On the contrary, value stocks like Intel are currently very cheap. In this market, no one wants to own ""Dinosaur"" companies that aren't growing. They would rather own the companies they expect to be bigger in 30 years, like AMD, Nvidia, etc. And with a 1-2% discount rate, the math checks out. When interest rates rise substantially, if they do, growth stocks that depend on low rates to justify their valuation will get hit HARD, with as much as 80% downside. Value stocks will be hit as well as their future earnings are discounted further, but not nearly to the same extent that growth stocks do, since they have high present earnings. Personally, my portfolio is tilted very high towards value stocks and profitable stocks. I hold Fidelity Large Cap Value and Fidelity Small Cap value, and Fidelity Real Estate, as well as VYM and VIG as an indirect way to factor tilt towards profitable stocks. Of course, stocks always carry market risk. A recession can drive a crash due to lower earnings, as it did in 2009, and in 2020. If you are investing for the short term, it may be smart to avoid having too much in equities.","I’m having a hard time conceptually understanding discounted future earnings…Is the idea if the risk-free rate goes up from 1.5% to 3.0%, then the company needs to have double forecasted earnings to keep valuation the same?",0,0.562,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"S&P 500 forward price to earnings ratios are at the highest they've been since the tech bubble. This may lead to the question- are we in a bubble? One way of valuing the true value of a stock is how much in earnings it will produce in the future. Present earnings are worth more than future earnings. Generally, a discount rate is used, which is based on treasury yields, but at a higher interest rate to compensate for the risk of owning equities. Historically, the S&P 500 earnings yield has often closely tracked the 10 year treasury yield, because earnings are expected to grow over time, providing further upside potential, whereas treasuries pay a fixed rate. https://www.yardeni.com/pub/valuationfed.pdf This hasn't been the case in current years. Currently, the S&P500's forward earnings yield is 4.68%, vs a 1.53% treasury yield. Contrast this with the '99 tech bubble, where treasury yields were much higher than the S&P500 earnings yield prior to the crash. The big risk is of course rising treasury yields as the fed tapers, and eventually raises benchmark rates. Rising treasury yields make bonds more attractive relative to current equity prices, which can lead to a decline if earnings aren't growing. Fortunately, there is a way you can hedge against this risk. During periods of rising interest rates and inflation, ""Value"" stocks usually outperform ""growth"" stocks.
