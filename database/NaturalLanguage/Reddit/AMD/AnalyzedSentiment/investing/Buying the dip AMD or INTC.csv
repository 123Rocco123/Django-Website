They also invest heavily in US and European factories, which might be good in the long run but will certainly cost a lot of money in the short term.AMD meanwhile is eating Intel's market shares on the consumer and data center sectors, at accelerating paces. With the aquisition of xilinix they also expand into the industrial/robotics sector. Their CPU's (and hopefully next Gen GPUs) are just the best bang for the buck, more processing power with better power efficiancy. The only bear case, beside broader market condition, is their dependency on TSMC, if China decides to say f*ck it, let's go for Taiwan, it would be instant knockout for AMD (although you better worry about collecting bottlecaps instead of stock prices then).Imo trying to catch Intel is trying to catch the falling knife.",0,0.545,1.0,NEGATIVE

With the new generation of CPUs to be released I believe this trend will continue. AMD in the graphic department us somewhat lackluster but there might be light at the end of the tunnel with their new release in November. They likely won't beat Nvidia in performance but they have a good chance at releasing products with much better value now that the pricing of Nvidia is out of proportion. Of course that is pure speculation but should AMD be succesful in the graphic department then they will be accelerating their revenue in both CPU and GPU department.,0,0.58,0.874,NEGATIVE
