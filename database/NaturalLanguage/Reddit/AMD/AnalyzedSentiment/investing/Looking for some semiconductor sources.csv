,"Hi I'm trying to find a reliable source exclusive to the semiconductor industry that compares each player in the field. I have a pretty good idea of what companies exists and the market cap etc etc but what I'm lacking is being up to date with each company project pipeline. And its time consuming going through each and every one of them. Is there any news analysis source that would be able to do a comparison between them ? I'm not interested in the technicals but more like an overview. For example Analysis Companies pipeline project for AI chips : NVDA with project A , AMD with project B , Qualcomm with Project C Companies pipeline projects for AR chips : ........ (you get the picture) Thank you :)","Bare silicon wafers are made by a few companies, Siltronic AG, Sumco, MEMC, and KinikFOUP's and FOSB's that house the wafers are largely made by Entegris.",0,0.514,1.0,NEGATIVE

No matter the hype cycle, that's what happens in semiconductors. Just in the last decade, it was 5G, self driving, crypto, and now AI. To put it bluntly, it's a mature industry with a lot of immature executives. There are 200 companies in the US alone (used to be more like 2000).Anyway, if you want to get familiar with the industry, I like ""The Circuit"" podcast (https://thecircuit.fm/). Fabricated Knowledge is interesting (https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/).",0,0.522,1.0,NEGATIVE

Consisting of the 20 largest conpanies in the industry (Nvidia, asml, broadcom, TSMC etc). It’s only available in Europe I think, not sure about the US.I’ve been working in the semiconductor industry for many years now. It’s really best to follow the biggest companies, rather than following individual ones.This way you don’t have to follow news of specific companies, but about the industry in general. Makes life easier :).",0,0.532,0.999,POSITIVE

There are very key differences around capital investments there.,2,0.562,0.687,NEGATIVE
