,"I'm leaning towards keeping my investing passive by holding VTI/VXUS in my portfolio and VT in my Roth IRA. But I also bought fractional shares of multiple companies just to dip my toes in active investing. Would it be advisable to sell off most of those individual stocks and stash the money in my passive account? I'm thinking of just keeping some like AMD, NVDA, GOOGL, MSFT, AAPL, ABBV. What would you choose?","If you're making index funds (VOO, VTI, etc.) the core of your portfolio, then you already have a notable percentage in large caps like GOOGL, MSFT, and AAPL. There's no point in adding more unless you either (a) find it fun or (b) really want to overweight on large cap tech.It's a fairly common approach to have index funds as your core and surround it with 'satellites' of individual stock picks. However, my personal suggestion is to make sure you have a philosophy on what & why you're picking. Just doubling down on the obvious winners of the past seems a little boring to me, but if you think it's the way to go, go nuts.",0,0.516,0.878,NEGATIVE

What would you choose?","The question you're asking is not one anyone can directly answer for you, because it's comes down to your personal risk tolerance. What we/other people can do is tell you what kind of risk level you're talking about, so you can make sure that you're not taking on more or less risk than you actually want to.The biggest thing as a new investor is to make sure you really understand what risk is, because the word gets thrown around a lot in ways that are often misleading. The bull market and recent tech stock run have caused a lot of people to start saying ""low risk"" as if it means ""won't collapse, but offers lower returns"" and ""high risk"" as if it means ""might collapse, otherwise grows faster."" That is not how risk works.""Low risk"" investments can still lose money in a bear market, they'll just tend to lose less. The probability distribution is a tall curve, with a majority of possible outcomes clustered tightly together. Note that it's not necessarily a normal curve - it could still be skewed with one longer tail and one shorter tail, but the curve will generally have a more pronounced hump and skinnier tails.""High risk"" investments can still end up yielding low returns in a bull market, they just have the potential to return more if they do well. The probability curve is either much flatter, or becomes inverted, as fewer outcomes fall near the center and more outcomes fall at the ends.Nothing but individual companies is SUPER risky, nothing but well-diversified ETFs is about as safe as you can get without leaving the equities market entirely. Including some individual companies in a mostly-ETF portfolio is a little bit riskier than the all-ETF approach, and risk goes up the more you shift in that direction.
