,"Hello everyone, I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'. This yielded the following table: + A B C D E F G H 1 Company Current Price Price Target Percent to Target Total Ratings # Strong Buy Ratings # Buy Ratings % of Ratings that were Strong Buys 2 AAPL 222.08 209.76 105.87% 38 11 21 28.95% 3 MSFT 418.35 459.66 91.01% 34 14 13 41.18% 4 NVDA 117.02 125.69 93.10% 38 14 15 36.84% 5 AMZN 186.98 206.43 90.58% 47 15 28 31.91% 6 META 474.83 490.04 96.90% 63 21 34 33.33% 7 GOOG 173.15 185.45 93.37% 5 0 3 0.00% 8 BRK.B 438.5 441.47 99.33% 6 1 3 16.67% 9 LLY 804.27 817.03 98.44% 22 9 8 40.91% 10 AVGO 160.68 180.62 88.96% 29 10 17 34.48% 11 JPM 212.8 200.66 106.05% 28 9 13 32.14% 12 TSLA 232.07 189.09 122.73% 23 0 0 0.00% 13 UNH 576.16 569.6 101.15% 22 11 11 50.00% 14 XOM 118.59 122.83 96.55% 25 5 11 20.00% 15 V 265.67 282.26 94.12% 39 13 22 33.33% 16 JNJ 157.85 158.53 99.57% 23 4 8 17.39% 17 PG 160.76 161.5 99.54% 22 6 4 27.27% 18 MA 463.71 474.87 97.65% 39 14 20 35.90% 19 HD 368.16 355.97 103.42% 33 12 12 36.36% 20 COST 822 886.84 92.69% 29 7 11 24.14% 21 WMT 68.64 68.29 100.51% 32 8 7 25.00% 22 MRK 113.13 132.14 85.61% 21 4 7 19.05% 23 BAC 40.31 41.95 96.09% 30 6 16 20.00% 24 CVX 160.47 167.84 95.61% 24 6 10 25.00% 25 NFLX 628.35 640.43 98.11% 41 11 14 26.83% 26 KO 66.74 64.8 102.99% 25 5 7 20.00% 27 CRM 258.8 274.18 94.39% 45 16 25 35.56% 28 ADBE 551.65 566.58 97.36% 31 11 14 35.48% 29 PEP 172.67 168.65 102.38% 22 10 10 45.45% 30 TMO 613.34 629.42 97.45% 15 8 6 53.33% 31 AMD 144.48 175.48 82.33% 31     0.00% 32 LIN 453.5 475.32 95.41%       #DIV/0! 33 ORCL 139.45 140.03 99.59% 36 10 16 27.78% 34 WFC 59.34 59.8 99.23% 31 4 8 12.90% 35 ACN 330.62 348.01 95.00% 29 7 9 24.14% 36 CSCO 48.45 50.56 95.83% 27 8 11 29.63% 37 MCD 265.4 276.47 96.00% 33 8 15 24.24% 38 QCOM 180.95 191.24 94.62% 23 2 7 8.70% 39 GE 170.2 171.93 98.99% 17 5   29.41% 40 ABT 105.94 124.37 85.18% 20 7 6 35.00% 41 TXN 203.81 187.18 108.88% 32 6 8 18.75% 42 DHR 277.08 284.09 97.53% 17 7 6 41.18% 43 AMGN 332.47 320.24 103.82% 25 3 7 12.00% 44 INTU 647.35 711.36 91.00% 22 6 3 27.27% 45 PM 115.16 115.74 99.50% 18 2 7 11.11% 46 PFE 30.54 29.38 103.95% 22 2 11 9.09% 47 IBM 192.14 172.59 111.33% 25 4 4 16.00% 48 DIS 93.69 123.11 76.10% 30 5 10 16.67% 49 VZ 40.52 45.6 88.86% 32 2 6 6.25% 50 CAT 346.2 337.62 102.54% 24 4 7 16.67% 51 NOW 814.39 807.1 100.90% 34 13 17 38.24% 52 AMAT 212.2 248.8 85.29% 21 4 15 19.05% 53 GS 509.03 476.64 106.80% 27 4 7 14.81% 54 CMCSA 41.27 46.36 89.02% 31 12 18 38.71% 55 SPGI 484.73 521.39 92.97% 15 1 9 6.67% 56 RTX 117.49 103.93 113.05%       #DIV/0! 57 ISRG 444.61 471.87 94.22% 17 6 5 35.29% 58 NEE 76.39 80.23 95.21% 15 5 8 33.33% 59 UNP 246.73 242.11 101.91% 29 5 7 17.24% 60 AXP 253.04 253.26 99.91% 28 6 4 21.43% 61 LOW 245.51 250.99 97.82% 32 8 10 25.00% 62 T 19.25 19.3 99.74% 30 6 3 20.00% 63 HON 204.75 226.96 90.21% 20 7 9 35.00% 64 UBER 64.47 79.96 80.63%       #DIV/0! 65 VRTX 495.72 483.91 102.44% 27 10 12 37.04% 66 MS 103.21 105.64 97.70% 27 3 14 11.11% 67 TJX 113.02 107.04 105.59% 27 9 14 33.33% 68 INTC 30.74 38.02 80.85% 41   18 0.00% 69 BKNG 3715.01 4192.39 88.61%       #DIV/0! 70 PGR 214.12 237.47 90.17% 19 5 4 26.32% 71 C 64.88 71.01 91.37% 29 5 12 17.24% 72 ELV 532.03 599.13 88.80%       #DIV/0! 73 BLK 876.5 936.85 93.56% 15 3 9 20.00% 74 PLD 126.05 135.68 92.90% 18 4 8 22.22% 75 LMT 541.92 535.31 101.23% 22 7   31.82% 76 ETN 304.79 345.86 88.13% 24 3 4 12.50% 77 REGN 1079.19 1104.34 97.72% 26 7 6 26.92% 78 MU 109.82 174.41 62.97% 31 8 20 25.81% 79 CB 275.66 277.84 99.22% 19 5 11 26.32% 80 SYK 327.45 378.81 86.44% 27 11 6 40.74% 81 ADI 231.38 255.84 90.44% 26 6 10 23.08% 82 LRCX 921.24 1041.75 88.43% 19 3 12 15.79% 83 MMC 222.57 223.48 99.59% 19 4 7 21.05% 84 BSX 73.88 87.57 84.37% 24 10 8 41.67% 85 MDT 80.32 92.43 86.90% 23 4 7 17.39% 86 BA 190.6 219.35 86.89% 25 7 7 28.00% 87 ADP 262.62 264.65 99.23% 18 1 1 5.56% 88 AMT 220.4 230.39 95.66% 22 7 14 31.82% 89 PANW 324.73 343.43 94.55% 41 13 16 31.71% 90 KLAC 823.07 868.07 94.82% 14 2 4 14.29% 91 BX 142.15 135.47 104.93% 14 6 6 42.86% 92 CI 348.67 393.25 88.66% 17 6 7 35.29% 93 BMY 47.56 50.47 94.23% 22 5 4 22.73% 94 GILD 76.06 81.02 93.88% 28 2 11 7.14% 95 SCHW 65.19 73.89 88.23% 19 5 9 26.32% 96 DE 371.98 422.99 87.94% 22 4 3 18.18% 97 FI 163.57 177.14 92.34% 19 1 2 5.26% 98 UPS 130.37 144.61 90.15% 26 3 2 11.54% 99 SO 83.52 79.51 105.04% 17 1 4 5.88% 100 TMUS 182.28 197.95 92.08% 30 7 16 23.33% 101 COP 111.2 141.51 78.58% 21 6 9 28.57% Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies: Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU) I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

This yielded the following table: + A B C D E F G H 1 Company Current Price Price Target Percent to Target Total Ratings # Strong Buy Ratings # Buy Ratings % of Ratings that were Strong Buys 2 AAPL 222.08 209.76 105.87% 38 11 21 28.95% 3 MSFT 418.35 459.66 91.01% 34 14 13 41.18% 4 NVDA 117.02 125.69 93.10% 38 14 15 36.84% 5 AMZN 186.98 206.43 90.58% 47 15 28 31.91% 6 META 474.83 490.04 96.90% 63 21 34 33.33% 7 GOOG 173.15 185.45 93.37% 5 0 3 0.00% 8 BRK.B 438.5 441.47 99.33% 6 1 3 16.67% 9 LLY 804.27 817.03 98.44% 22 9 8 40.91% 10 AVGO 160.68 180.62 88.96% 29 10 17 34.48% 11 JPM 212.8 200.66 106.05% 28 9 13 32.14% 12 TSLA 232.07 189.09 122.73% 23 0 0 0.00% 13 UNH 576.16 569.6 101.15% 22 11 11 50.00% 14 XOM 118.59 122.83 96.55% 25 5 11 20.00% 15 V 265.67 282.26 94.12% 39 13 22 33.33% 16 JNJ 157.85 158.53 99.57% 23 4 8 17.39% 17 PG 160.76 161.5 99.54% 22 6 4 27.27% 18 MA 463.71 474.87 97.65% 39 14 20 35.90% 19 HD 368.16 355.97 103.42% 33 12 12 36.36% 20 COST 822 886.84 92.69% 29 7 11 24.14% 21 WMT 68.64 68.29 100.51% 32 8 7 25.00% 22 MRK 113.13 132.14 85.61% 21 4 7 19.05% 23 BAC 40.31 41.95 96.09% 30 6 16 20.00% 24 CVX 160.47 167.84 95.61% 24 6 10 25.00% 25 NFLX 628.35 640.43 98.11% 41 11 14 26.83% 26 KO 66.74 64.8 102.99% 25 5 7 20.00% 27 CRM 258.8 274.18 94.39% 45 16 25 35.56% 28 ADBE 551.65 566.58 97.36% 31 11 14 35.48% 29 PEP 172.67 168.65 102.38% 22 10 10 45.45% 30 TMO 613.34 629.42 97.45% 15 8 6 53.33% 31 AMD 144.48 175.48 82.33% 31     0.00% 32 LIN 453.5 475.32 95.41%       #DIV/0! 33 ORCL 139.45 140.03 99.59% 36 10 16 27.78% 34 WFC 59.34 59.8 99.23% 31 4 8 12.90% 35 ACN 330.62 348.01 95.00% 29 7 9 24.14% 36 CSCO 48.45 50.56 95.83% 27 8 11 29.63% 37 MCD 265.4 276.47 96.00% 33 8 15 24.24% 38 QCOM 180.95 191.24 94.62% 23 2 7 8.70% 39 GE 170.2 171.93 98.99% 17 5   29.41% 40 ABT 105.94 124.37 85.18% 20 7 6 35.00% 41 TXN 203.81 187.18 108.88% 32 6 8 18.75% 42 DHR 277.08 284.09 97.53% 17 7 6 41.18% 43 AMGN 332.47 320.24 103.82% 25 3 7 12.00% 44 INTU 647.35 711.36 91.00% 22 6 3 27.27% 45 PM 115.16 115.74 99.50% 18 2 7 11.11% 46 PFE 30.54 29.38 103.95% 22 2 11 9.09% 47 IBM 192.14 172.59 111.33% 25 4 4 16.00% 48 DIS 93.69 123.11 76.10% 30 5 10 16.67% 49 VZ 40.52 45.6 88.86% 32 2 6 6.25% 50 CAT 346.2 337.62 102.54% 24 4 7 16.67% 51 NOW 814.39 807.1 100.90% 34 13 17 38.24% 52 AMAT 212.2 248.8 85.29% 21 4 15 19.05% 53 GS 509.03 476.64 106.80% 27 4 7 14.81% 54 CMCSA 41.27 46.36 89.02% 31 12 18 38.71% 55 SPGI 484.73 521.39 92.97% 15 1 9 6.67% 56 RTX 117.49 103.93 113.05%       #DIV/0! 57 ISRG 444.61 471.87 94.22% 17 6 5 35.29% 58 NEE 76.39 80.23 95.21% 15 5 8 33.33% 59 UNP 246.73 242.11 101.91% 29 5 7 17.24% 60 AXP 253.04 253.26 99.91% 28 6 4 21.43% 61 LOW 245.51 250.99 97.82% 32 8 10 25.00% 62 T 19.25 19.3 99.74% 30 6 3 20.00% 63 HON 204.75 226.96 90.21% 20 7 9 35.00% 64 UBER 64.47 79.96 80.63%       #DIV/0! 65 VRTX 495.72 483.91 102.44% 27 10 12 37.04% 66 MS 103.21 105.64 97.70% 27 3 14 11.11% 67 TJX 113.02 107.04 105.59% 27 9 14 33.33% 68 INTC 30.74 38.02 80.85% 41   18 0.00% 69 BKNG 3715.01 4192.39 88.61%       #DIV/0! 70 PGR 214.12 237.47 90.17% 19 5 4 26.32% 71 C 64.88 71.01 91.37% 29 5 12 17.24% 72 ELV 532.03 599.13 88.80%       #DIV/0! 73 BLK 876.5 936.85 93.56% 15 3 9 20.00% 74 PLD 126.05 135.68 92.90% 18 4 8 22.22% 75 LMT 541.92 535.31 101.23% 22 7   31.82% 76 ETN 304.79 345.86 88.13% 24 3 4 12.50% 77 REGN 1079.19 1104.34 97.72% 26 7 6 26.92% 78 MU 109.82 174.41 62.97% 31 8 20 25.81% 79 CB 275.66 277.84 99.22% 19 5 11 26.32% 80 SYK 327.45 378.81 86.44% 27 11 6 40.74% 81 ADI 231.38 255.84 90.44% 26 6 10 23.08% 82 LRCX 921.24 1041.75 88.43% 19 3 12 15.79% 83 MMC 222.57 223.48 99.59% 19 4 7 21.05% 84 BSX 73.88 87.57 84.37% 24 10 8 41.67% 85 MDT 80.32 92.43 86.90% 23 4 7 17.39% 86 BA 190.6 219.35 86.89% 25 7 7 28.00% 87 ADP 262.62 264.65 99.23% 18 1 1 5.56% 88 AMT 220.4 230.39 95.66% 22 7 14 31.82% 89 PANW 324.73 343.43 94.55% 41 13 16 31.71% 90 KLAC 823.07 868.07 94.82% 14 2 4 14.29% 91 BX 142.15 135.47 104.93% 14 6 6 42.86% 92 CI 348.67 393.25 88.66% 17 6 7 35.29% 93 BMY 47.56 50.47 94.23% 22 5 4 22.73% 94 GILD 76.06 81.02 93.88% 28 2 11 7.14% 95 SCHW 65.19 73.89 88.23% 19 5 9 26.32% 96 DE 371.98 422.99 87.94% 22 4 3 18.18% 97 FI 163.57 177.14 92.34% 19 1 2 5.26% 98 UPS 130.37 144.61 90.15% 26 3 2 11.54% 99 SO 83.52 79.51 105.04% 17 1 4 5.88% 100 TMUS 182.28 197.95 92.08% 30 7 16 23.33% 101 COP 111.2 141.51 78.58% 21 6 9 28.57% Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies: Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU) I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months. What do you guys think?",Go back ten years and run this strategy and see if it would have worked,0,0.526,0.677,NEGATIVE
,"Hello everyone, I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'. This yielded the following table: + A B C D E F G H 1 Company Current Price Price Target Percent to Target Total Ratings # Strong Buy Ratings # Buy Ratings % of Ratings that were Strong Buys 2 AAPL 222.08 209.76 105.87% 38 11 21 28.95% 3 MSFT 418.35 459.66 91.01% 34 14 13 41.18% 4 NVDA 117.02 125.69 93.10% 38 14 15 36.84% 5 AMZN 186.98 206.43 90.58% 47 15 28 31.91% 6 META 474.83 490.04 96.90% 63 21 34 33.33% 7 GOOG 173.15 185.45 93.37% 5 0 3 0.00% 8 BRK.B 438.5 441.47 99.33% 6 1 3 16.67% 9 LLY 804.27 817.03 98.44% 22 9 8 40.91% 10 AVGO 160.68 180.62 88.96% 29 10 17 34.48% 11 JPM 212.8 200.66 106.05% 28 9 13 32.14% 12 TSLA 232.07 189.09 122.73% 23 0 0 0.00% 13 UNH 576.16 569.6 101.15% 22 11 11 50.00% 14 XOM 118.59 122.83 96.55% 25 5 11 20.00% 15 V 265.67 282.26 94.12% 39 13 22 33.33% 16 JNJ 157.85 158.53 99.57% 23 4 8 17.39% 17 PG 160.76 161.5 99.54% 22 6 4 27.27% 18 MA 463.71 474.87 97.65% 39 14 20 35.90% 19 HD 368.16 355.97 103.42% 33 12 12 36.36% 20 COST 822 886.84 92.69% 29 7 11 24.14% 21 WMT 68.64 68.29 100.51% 32 8 7 25.00% 22 MRK 113.13 132.14 85.61% 21 4 7 19.05% 23 BAC 40.31 41.95 96.09% 30 6 16 20.00% 24 CVX 160.47 167.84 95.61% 24 6 10 25.00% 25 NFLX 628.35 640.43 98.11% 41 11 14 26.83% 26 KO 66.74 64.8 102.99% 25 5 7 20.00% 27 CRM 258.8 274.18 94.39% 45 16 25 35.56% 28 ADBE 551.65 566.58 97.36% 31 11 14 35.48% 29 PEP 172.67 168.65 102.38% 22 10 10 45.45% 30 TMO 613.34 629.42 97.45% 15 8 6 53.33% 31 AMD 144.48 175.48 82.33% 31     0.00% 32 LIN 453.5 475.32 95.41%       #DIV/0! 33 ORCL 139.45 140.03 99.59% 36 10 16 27.78% 34 WFC 59.34 59.8 99.23% 31 4 8 12.90% 35 ACN 330.62 348.01 95.00% 29 7 9 24.14% 36 CSCO 48.45 50.56 95.83% 27 8 11 29.63% 37 MCD 265.4 276.47 96.00% 33 8 15 24.24% 38 QCOM 180.95 191.24 94.62% 23 2 7 8.70% 39 GE 170.2 171.93 98.99% 17 5   29.41% 40 ABT 105.94 124.37 85.18% 20 7 6 35.00% 41 TXN 203.81 187.18 108.88% 32 6 8 18.75% 42 DHR 277.08 284.09 97.53% 17 7 6 41.18% 43 AMGN 332.47 320.24 103.82% 25 3 7 12.00% 44 INTU 647.35 711.36 91.00% 22 6 3 27.27% 45 PM 115.16 115.74 99.50% 18 2 7 11.11% 46 PFE 30.54 29.38 103.95% 22 2 11 9.09% 47 IBM 192.14 172.59 111.33% 25 4 4 16.00% 48 DIS 93.69 123.11 76.10% 30 5 10 16.67% 49 VZ 40.52 45.6 88.86% 32 2 6 6.25% 50 CAT 346.2 337.62 102.54% 24 4 7 16.67% 51 NOW 814.39 807.1 100.90% 34 13 17 38.24% 52 AMAT 212.2 248.8 85.29% 21 4 15 19.05% 53 GS 509.03 476.64 106.80% 27 4 7 14.81% 54 CMCSA 41.27 46.36 89.02% 31 12 18 38.71% 55 SPGI 484.73 521.39 92.97% 15 1 9 6.67% 56 RTX 117.49 103.93 113.05%       #DIV/0! 57 ISRG 444.61 471.87 94.22% 17 6 5 35.29% 58 NEE 76.39 80.23 95.21% 15 5 8 33.33% 59 UNP 246.73 242.11 101.91% 29 5 7 17.24% 60 AXP 253.04 253.26 99.91% 28 6 4 21.43% 61 LOW 245.51 250.99 97.82% 32 8 10 25.00% 62 T 19.25 19.3 99.74% 30 6 3 20.00% 63 HON 204.75 226.96 90.21% 20 7 9 35.00% 64 UBER 64.47 79.96 80.63%       #DIV/0! 65 VRTX 495.72 483.91 102.44% 27 10 12 37.04% 66 MS 103.21 105.64 97.70% 27 3 14 11.11% 67 TJX 113.02 107.04 105.59% 27 9 14 33.33% 68 INTC 30.74 38.02 80.85% 41   18 0.00% 69 BKNG 3715.01 4192.39 88.61%       #DIV/0! 70 PGR 214.12 237.47 90.17% 19 5 4 26.32% 71 C 64.88 71.01 91.37% 29 5 12 17.24% 72 ELV 532.03 599.13 88.80%       #DIV/0! 73 BLK 876.5 936.85 93.56% 15 3 9 20.00% 74 PLD 126.05 135.68 92.90% 18 4 8 22.22% 75 LMT 541.92 535.31 101.23% 22 7   31.82% 76 ETN 304.79 345.86 88.13% 24 3 4 12.50% 77 REGN 1079.19 1104.34 97.72% 26 7 6 26.92% 78 MU 109.82 174.41 62.97% 31 8 20 25.81% 79 CB 275.66 277.84 99.22% 19 5 11 26.32% 80 SYK 327.45 378.81 86.44% 27 11 6 40.74% 81 ADI 231.38 255.84 90.44% 26 6 10 23.08% 82 LRCX 921.24 1041.75 88.43% 19 3 12 15.79% 83 MMC 222.57 223.48 99.59% 19 4 7 21.05% 84 BSX 73.88 87.57 84.37% 24 10 8 41.67% 85 MDT 80.32 92.43 86.90% 23 4 7 17.39% 86 BA 190.6 219.35 86.89% 25 7 7 28.00% 87 ADP 262.62 264.65 99.23% 18 1 1 5.56% 88 AMT 220.4 230.39 95.66% 22 7 14 31.82% 89 PANW 324.73 343.43 94.55% 41 13 16 31.71% 90 KLAC 823.07 868.07 94.82% 14 2 4 14.29% 91 BX 142.15 135.47 104.93% 14 6 6 42.86% 92 CI 348.67 393.25 88.66% 17 6 7 35.29% 93 BMY 47.56 50.47 94.23% 22 5 4 22.73% 94 GILD 76.06 81.02 93.88% 28 2 11 7.14% 95 SCHW 65.19 73.89 88.23% 19 5 9 26.32% 96 DE 371.98 422.99 87.94% 22 4 3 18.18% 97 FI 163.57 177.14 92.34% 19 1 2 5.26% 98 UPS 130.37 144.61 90.15% 26 3 2 11.54% 99 SO 83.52 79.51 105.04% 17 1 4 5.88% 100 TMUS 182.28 197.95 92.08% 30 7 16 23.33% 101 COP 111.2 141.51 78.58% 21 6 9 28.57% Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies: Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU) I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months. What do you guys think?","It'll be tricky to do that because I'd need to go back 10 years ago and find what the analyst ratings and price targets were at that time for the top 100 companies and make different stock pick selections to trend for the following 10 years.I have no qualms about doing that, I just don't know where to find that data",1,0.545,0.999,NEGATIVE
,"Hello everyone, I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'. This yielded the following table: + A B C D E F G H 1 Company Current Price Price Target Percent to Target Total Ratings # Strong Buy Ratings # Buy Ratings % of Ratings that were Strong Buys 2 AAPL 222.08 209.76 105.87% 38 11 21 28.95% 3 MSFT 418.35 459.66 91.01% 34 14 13 41.18% 4 NVDA 117.02 125.69 93.10% 38 14 15 36.84% 5 AMZN 186.98 206.43 90.58% 47 15 28 31.91% 6 META 474.83 490.04 96.90% 63 21 34 33.33% 7 GOOG 173.15 185.45 93.37% 5 0 3 0.00% 8 BRK.B 438.5 441.47 99.33% 6 1 3 16.67% 9 LLY 804.27 817.03 98.44% 22 9 8 40.91% 10 AVGO 160.68 180.62 88.96% 29 10 17 34.48% 11 JPM 212.8 200.66 106.05% 28 9 13 32.14% 12 TSLA 232.07 189.09 122.73% 23 0 0 0.00% 13 UNH 576.16 569.6 101.15% 22 11 11 50.00% 14 XOM 118.59 122.83 96.55% 25 5 11 20.00% 15 V 265.67 282.26 94.12% 39 13 22 33.33% 16 JNJ 157.85 158.53 99.57% 23 4 8 17.39% 17 PG 160.76 161.5 99.54% 22 6 4 27.27% 18 MA 463.71 474.87 97.65% 39 14 20 35.90% 19 HD 368.16 355.97 103.42% 33 12 12 36.36% 20 COST 822 886.84 92.69% 29 7 11 24.14% 21 WMT 68.64 68.29 100.51% 32 8 7 25.00% 22 MRK 113.13 132.14 85.61% 21 4 7 19.05% 23 BAC 40.31 41.95 96.09% 30 6 16 20.00% 24 CVX 160.47 167.84 95.61% 24 6 10 25.00% 25 NFLX 628.35 640.43 98.11% 41 11 14 26.83% 26 KO 66.74 64.8 102.99% 25 5 7 20.00% 27 CRM 258.8 274.18 94.39% 45 16 25 35.56% 28 ADBE 551.65 566.58 97.36% 31 11 14 35.48% 29 PEP 172.67 168.65 102.38% 22 10 10 45.45% 30 TMO 613.34 629.42 97.45% 15 8 6 53.33% 31 AMD 144.48 175.48 82.33% 31     0.00% 32 LIN 453.5 475.32 95.41%       #DIV/0! 33 ORCL 139.45 140.03 99.59% 36 10 16 27.78% 34 WFC 59.34 59.8 99.23% 31 4 8 12.90% 35 ACN 330.62 348.01 95.00% 29 7 9 24.14% 36 CSCO 48.45 50.56 95.83% 27 8 11 29.63% 37 MCD 265.4 276.47 96.00% 33 8 15 24.24% 38 QCOM 180.95 191.24 94.62% 23 2 7 8.70% 39 GE 170.2 171.93 98.99% 17 5   29.41% 40 ABT 105.94 124.37 85.18% 20 7 6 35.00% 41 TXN 203.81 187.18 108.88% 32 6 8 18.75% 42 DHR 277.08 284.09 97.53% 17 7 6 41.18% 43 AMGN 332.47 320.24 103.82% 25 3 7 12.00% 44 INTU 647.35 711.36 91.00% 22 6 3 27.27% 45 PM 115.16 115.74 99.50% 18 2 7 11.11% 46 PFE 30.54 29.38 103.95% 22 2 11 9.09% 47 IBM 192.14 172.59 111.33% 25 4 4 16.00% 48 DIS 93.69 123.11 76.10% 30 5 10 16.67% 49 VZ 40.52 45.6 88.86% 32 2 6 6.25% 50 CAT 346.2 337.62 102.54% 24 4 7 16.67% 51 NOW 814.39 807.1 100.90% 34 13 17 38.24% 52 AMAT 212.2 248.8 85.29% 21 4 15 19.05% 53 GS 509.03 476.64 106.80% 27 4 7 14.81% 54 CMCSA 41.27 46.36 89.02% 31 12 18 38.71% 55 SPGI 484.73 521.39 92.97% 15 1 9 6.67% 56 RTX 117.49 103.93 113.05%       #DIV/0! 57 ISRG 444.61 471.87 94.22% 17 6 5 35.29% 58 NEE 76.39 80.23 95.21% 15 5 8 33.33% 59 UNP 246.73 242.11 101.91% 29 5 7 17.24% 60 AXP 253.04 253.26 99.91% 28 6 4 21.43% 61 LOW 245.51 250.99 97.82% 32 8 10 25.00% 62 T 19.25 19.3 99.74% 30 6 3 20.00% 63 HON 204.75 226.96 90.21% 20 7 9 35.00% 64 UBER 64.47 79.96 80.63%       #DIV/0! 65 VRTX 495.72 483.91 102.44% 27 10 12 37.04% 66 MS 103.21 105.64 97.70% 27 3 14 11.11% 67 TJX 113.02 107.04 105.59% 27 9 14 33.33% 68 INTC 30.74 38.02 80.85% 41   18 0.00% 69 BKNG 3715.01 4192.39 88.61%       #DIV/0! 70 PGR 214.12 237.47 90.17% 19 5 4 26.32% 71 C 64.88 71.01 91.37% 29 5 12 17.24% 72 ELV 532.03 599.13 88.80%       #DIV/0! 73 BLK 876.5 936.85 93.56% 15 3 9 20.00% 74 PLD 126.05 135.68 92.90% 18 4 8 22.22% 75 LMT 541.92 535.31 101.23% 22 7   31.82% 76 ETN 304.79 345.86 88.13% 24 3 4 12.50% 77 REGN 1079.19 1104.34 97.72% 26 7 6 26.92% 78 MU 109.82 174.41 62.97% 31 8 20 25.81% 79 CB 275.66 277.84 99.22% 19 5 11 26.32% 80 SYK 327.45 378.81 86.44% 27 11 6 40.74% 81 ADI 231.38 255.84 90.44% 26 6 10 23.08% 82 LRCX 921.24 1041.75 88.43% 19 3 12 15.79% 83 MMC 222.57 223.48 99.59% 19 4 7 21.05% 84 BSX 73.88 87.57 84.37% 24 10 8 41.67% 85 MDT 80.32 92.43 86.90% 23 4 7 17.39% 86 BA 190.6 219.35 86.89% 25 7 7 28.00% 87 ADP 262.62 264.65 99.23% 18 1 1 5.56% 88 AMT 220.4 230.39 95.66% 22 7 14 31.82% 89 PANW 324.73 343.43 94.55% 41 13 16 31.71% 90 KLAC 823.07 868.07 94.82% 14 2 4 14.29% 91 BX 142.15 135.47 104.93% 14 6 6 42.86% 92 CI 348.67 393.25 88.66% 17 6 7 35.29% 93 BMY 47.56 50.47 94.23% 22 5 4 22.73% 94 GILD 76.06 81.02 93.88% 28 2 11 7.14% 95 SCHW 65.19 73.89 88.23% 19 5 9 26.32% 96 DE 371.98 422.99 87.94% 22 4 3 18.18% 97 FI 163.57 177.14 92.34% 19 1 2 5.26% 98 UPS 130.37 144.61 90.15% 26 3 2 11.54% 99 SO 83.52 79.51 105.04% 17 1 4 5.88% 100 TMUS 182.28 197.95 92.08% 30 7 16 23.33% 101 COP 111.2 141.51 78.58% 21 6 9 28.57% Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies: Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU) I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months. What do you guys think?","That's what I'm interested in as well. Even last year: what were analysts predicting and what price are they at now? How accurate are analyst predictions? Then, try to find the ones most accurate, if any are even consistent, and see what they're saying now. Bonus points to repeat this exercise for every 12M price target made in the last 10 years.",2,0.556,0.999,POSITIVE
,"Hello everyone, I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'. This yielded the following table: + A B C D E F G H 1 Company Current Price Price Target Percent to Target Total Ratings # Strong Buy Ratings # Buy Ratings % of Ratings that were Strong Buys 2 AAPL 222.08 209.76 105.87% 38 11 21 28.95% 3 MSFT 418.35 459.66 91.01% 34 14 13 41.18% 4 NVDA 117.02 125.69 93.10% 38 14 15 36.84% 5 AMZN 186.98 206.43 90.58% 47 15 28 31.91% 6 META 474.83 490.04 96.90% 63 21 34 33.33% 7 GOOG 173.15 185.45 93.37% 5 0 3 0.00% 8 BRK.B 438.5 441.47 99.33% 6 1 3 16.67% 9 LLY 804.27 817.03 98.44% 22 9 8 40.91% 10 AVGO 160.68 180.62 88.96% 29 10 17 34.48% 11 JPM 212.8 200.66 106.05% 28 9 13 32.14% 12 TSLA 232.07 189.09 122.73% 23 0 0 0.00% 13 UNH 576.16 569.6 101.15% 22 11 11 50.00% 14 XOM 118.59 122.83 96.55% 25 5 11 20.00% 15 V 265.67 282.26 94.12% 39 13 22 33.33% 16 JNJ 157.85 158.53 99.57% 23 4 8 17.39% 17 PG 160.76 161.5 99.54% 22 6 4 27.27% 18 MA 463.71 474.87 97.65% 39 14 20 35.90% 19 HD 368.16 355.97 103.42% 33 12 12 36.36% 20 COST 822 886.84 92.69% 29 7 11 24.14% 21 WMT 68.64 68.29 100.51% 32 8 7 25.00% 22 MRK 113.13 132.14 85.61% 21 4 7 19.05% 23 BAC 40.31 41.95 96.09% 30 6 16 20.00% 24 CVX 160.47 167.84 95.61% 24 6 10 25.00% 25 NFLX 628.35 640.43 98.11% 41 11 14 26.83% 26 KO 66.74 64.8 102.99% 25 5 7 20.00% 27 CRM 258.8 274.18 94.39% 45 16 25 35.56% 28 ADBE 551.65 566.58 97.36% 31 11 14 35.48% 29 PEP 172.67 168.65 102.38% 22 10 10 45.45% 30 TMO 613.34 629.42 97.45% 15 8 6 53.33% 31 AMD 144.48 175.48 82.33% 31     0.00% 32 LIN 453.5 475.32 95.41%       #DIV/0! 33 ORCL 139.45 140.03 99.59% 36 10 16 27.78% 34 WFC 59.34 59.8 99.23% 31 4 8 12.90% 35 ACN 330.62 348.01 95.00% 29 7 9 24.14% 36 CSCO 48.45 50.56 95.83% 27 8 11 29.63% 37 MCD 265.4 276.47 96.00% 33 8 15 24.24% 38 QCOM 180.95 191.24 94.62% 23 2 7 8.70% 39 GE 170.2 171.93 98.99% 17 5   29.41% 40 ABT 105.94 124.37 85.18% 20 7 6 35.00% 41 TXN 203.81 187.18 108.88% 32 6 8 18.75% 42 DHR 277.08 284.09 97.53% 17 7 6 41.18% 43 AMGN 332.47 320.24 103.82% 25 3 7 12.00% 44 INTU 647.35 711.36 91.00% 22 6 3 27.27% 45 PM 115.16 115.74 99.50% 18 2 7 11.11% 46 PFE 30.54 29.38 103.95% 22 2 11 9.09% 47 IBM 192.14 172.59 111.33% 25 4 4 16.00% 48 DIS 93.69 123.11 76.10% 30 5 10 16.67% 49 VZ 40.52 45.6 88.86% 32 2 6 6.25% 50 CAT 346.2 337.62 102.54% 24 4 7 16.67% 51 NOW 814.39 807.1 100.90% 34 13 17 38.24% 52 AMAT 212.2 248.8 85.29% 21 4 15 19.05% 53 GS 509.03 476.64 106.80% 27 4 7 14.81% 54 CMCSA 41.27 46.36 89.02% 31 12 18 38.71% 55 SPGI 484.73 521.39 92.97% 15 1 9 6.67% 56 RTX 117.49 103.93 113.05%       #DIV/0! 57 ISRG 444.61 471.87 94.22% 17 6 5 35.29% 58 NEE 76.39 80.23 95.21% 15 5 8 33.33% 59 UNP 246.73 242.11 101.91% 29 5 7 17.24% 60 AXP 253.04 253.26 99.91% 28 6 4 21.43% 61 LOW 245.51 250.99 97.82% 32 8 10 25.00% 62 T 19.25 19.3 99.74% 30 6 3 20.00% 63 HON 204.75 226.96 90.21% 20 7 9 35.00% 64 UBER 64.47 79.96 80.63%       #DIV/0! 65 VRTX 495.72 483.91 102.44% 27 10 12 37.04% 66 MS 103.21 105.64 97.70% 27 3 14 11.11% 67 TJX 113.02 107.04 105.59% 27 9 14 33.33% 68 INTC 30.74 38.02 80.85% 41   18 0.00% 69 BKNG 3715.01 4192.39 88.61%       #DIV/0! 70 PGR 214.12 237.47 90.17% 19 5 4 26.32% 71 C 64.88 71.01 91.37% 29 5 12 17.24% 72 ELV 532.03 599.13 88.80%       #DIV/0! 73 BLK 876.5 936.85 93.56% 15 3 9 20.00% 74 PLD 126.05 135.68 92.90% 18 4 8 22.22% 75 LMT 541.92 535.31 101.23% 22 7   31.82% 76 ETN 304.79 345.86 88.13% 24 3 4 12.50% 77 REGN 1079.19 1104.34 97.72% 26 7 6 26.92% 78 MU 109.82 174.41 62.97% 31 8 20 25.81% 79 CB 275.66 277.84 99.22% 19 5 11 26.32% 80 SYK 327.45 378.81 86.44% 27 11 6 40.74% 81 ADI 231.38 255.84 90.44% 26 6 10 23.08% 82 LRCX 921.24 1041.75 88.43% 19 3 12 15.79% 83 MMC 222.57 223.48 99.59% 19 4 7 21.05% 84 BSX 73.88 87.57 84.37% 24 10 8 41.67% 85 MDT 80.32 92.43 86.90% 23 4 7 17.39% 86 BA 190.6 219.35 86.89% 25 7 7 28.00% 87 ADP 262.62 264.65 99.23% 18 1 1 5.56% 88 AMT 220.4 230.39 95.66% 22 7 14 31.82% 89 PANW 324.73 343.43 94.55% 41 13 16 31.71% 90 KLAC 823.07 868.07 94.82% 14 2 4 14.29% 91 BX 142.15 135.47 104.93% 14 6 6 42.86% 92 CI 348.67 393.25 88.66% 17 6 7 35.29% 93 BMY 47.56 50.47 94.23% 22 5 4 22.73% 94 GILD 76.06 81.02 93.88% 28 2 11 7.14% 95 SCHW 65.19 73.89 88.23% 19 5 9 26.32% 96 DE 371.98 422.99 87.94% 22 4 3 18.18% 97 FI 163.57 177.14 92.34% 19 1 2 5.26% 98 UPS 130.37 144.61 90.15% 26 3 2 11.54% 99 SO 83.52 79.51 105.04% 17 1 4 5.88% 100 TMUS 182.28 197.95 92.08% 30 7 16 23.33% 101 COP 111.2 141.51 78.58% 21 6 9 28.57% Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies: Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU) I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

,"Hello everyone, I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'. This yielded the following table: + A B C D E F G H 1 Company Current Price Price Target Percent to Target Total Ratings # Strong Buy Ratings # Buy Ratings % of Ratings that were Strong Buys 2 AAPL 222.08 209.76 105.87% 38 11 21 28.95% 3 MSFT 418.35 459.66 91.01% 34 14 13 41.18% 4 NVDA 117.02 125.69 93.10% 38 14 15 36.84% 5 AMZN 186.98 206.43 90.58% 47 15 28 31.91% 6 META 474.83 490.04 96.90% 63 21 34 33.33% 7 GOOG 173.15 185.45 93.37% 5 0 3 0.00% 8 BRK.B 438.5 441.47 99.33% 6 1 3 16.67% 9 LLY 804.27 817.03 98.44% 22 9 8 40.91% 10 AVGO 160.68 180.62 88.96% 29 10 17 34.48% 11 JPM 212.8 200.66 106.05% 28 9 13 32.14% 12 TSLA 232.07 189.09 122.73% 23 0 0 0.00% 13 UNH 576.16 569.6 101.15% 22 11 11 50.00% 14 XOM 118.59 122.83 96.55% 25 5 11 20.00% 15 V 265.67 282.26 94.12% 39 13 22 33.33% 16 JNJ 157.85 158.53 99.57% 23 4 8 17.39% 17 PG 160.76 161.5 99.54% 22 6 4 27.27% 18 MA 463.71 474.87 97.65% 39 14 20 35.90% 19 HD 368.16 355.97 103.42% 33 12 12 36.36% 20 COST 822 886.84 92.69% 29 7 11 24.14% 21 WMT 68.64 68.29 100.51% 32 8 7 25.00% 22 MRK 113.13 132.14 85.61% 21 4 7 19.05% 23 BAC 40.31 41.95 96.09% 30 6 16 20.00% 24 CVX 160.47 167.84 95.61% 24 6 10 25.00% 25 NFLX 628.35 640.43 98.11% 41 11 14 26.83% 26 KO 66.74 64.8 102.99% 25 5 7 20.00% 27 CRM 258.8 274.18 94.39% 45 16 25 35.56% 28 ADBE 551.65 566.58 97.36% 31 11 14 35.48% 29 PEP 172.67 168.65 102.38% 22 10 10 45.45% 30 TMO 613.34 629.42 97.45% 15 8 6 53.33% 31 AMD 144.48 175.48 82.33% 31     0.00% 32 LIN 453.5 475.32 95.41%       #DIV/0! 33 ORCL 139.45 140.03 99.59% 36 10 16 27.78% 34 WFC 59.34 59.8 99.23% 31 4 8 12.90% 35 ACN 330.62 348.01 95.00% 29 7 9 24.14% 36 CSCO 48.45 50.56 95.83% 27 8 11 29.63% 37 MCD 265.4 276.47 96.00% 33 8 15 24.24% 38 QCOM 180.95 191.24 94.62% 23 2 7 8.70% 39 GE 170.2 171.93 98.99% 17 5   29.41% 40 ABT 105.94 124.37 85.18% 20 7 6 35.00% 41 TXN 203.81 187.18 108.88% 32 6 8 18.75% 42 DHR 277.08 284.09 97.53% 17 7 6 41.18% 43 AMGN 332.47 320.24 103.82% 25 3 7 12.00% 44 INTU 647.35 711.36 91.00% 22 6 3 27.27% 45 PM 115.16 115.74 99.50% 18 2 7 11.11% 46 PFE 30.54 29.38 103.95% 22 2 11 9.09% 47 IBM 192.14 172.59 111.33% 25 4 4 16.00% 48 DIS 93.69 123.11 76.10% 30 5 10 16.67% 49 VZ 40.52 45.6 88.86% 32 2 6 6.25% 50 CAT 346.2 337.62 102.54% 24 4 7 16.67% 51 NOW 814.39 807.1 100.90% 34 13 17 38.24% 52 AMAT 212.2 248.8 85.29% 21 4 15 19.05% 53 GS 509.03 476.64 106.80% 27 4 7 14.81% 54 CMCSA 41.27 46.36 89.02% 31 12 18 38.71% 55 SPGI 484.73 521.39 92.97% 15 1 9 6.67% 56 RTX 117.49 103.93 113.05%       #DIV/0! 57 ISRG 444.61 471.87 94.22% 17 6 5 35.29% 58 NEE 76.39 80.23 95.21% 15 5 8 33.33% 59 UNP 246.73 242.11 101.91% 29 5 7 17.24% 60 AXP 253.04 253.26 99.91% 28 6 4 21.43% 61 LOW 245.51 250.99 97.82% 32 8 10 25.00% 62 T 19.25 19.3 99.74% 30 6 3 20.00% 63 HON 204.75 226.96 90.21% 20 7 9 35.00% 64 UBER 64.47 79.96 80.63%       #DIV/0! 65 VRTX 495.72 483.91 102.44% 27 10 12 37.04% 66 MS 103.21 105.64 97.70% 27 3 14 11.11% 67 TJX 113.02 107.04 105.59% 27 9 14 33.33% 68 INTC 30.74 38.02 80.85% 41   18 0.00% 69 BKNG 3715.01 4192.39 88.61%       #DIV/0! 70 PGR 214.12 237.47 90.17% 19 5 4 26.32% 71 C 64.88 71.01 91.37% 29 5 12 17.24% 72 ELV 532.03 599.13 88.80%       #DIV/0! 73 BLK 876.5 936.85 93.56% 15 3 9 20.00% 74 PLD 126.05 135.68 92.90% 18 4 8 22.22% 75 LMT 541.92 535.31 101.23% 22 7   31.82% 76 ETN 304.79 345.86 88.13% 24 3 4 12.50% 77 REGN 1079.19 1104.34 97.72% 26 7 6 26.92% 78 MU 109.82 174.41 62.97% 31 8 20 25.81% 79 CB 275.66 277.84 99.22% 19 5 11 26.32% 80 SYK 327.45 378.81 86.44% 27 11 6 40.74% 81 ADI 231.38 255.84 90.44% 26 6 10 23.08% 82 LRCX 921.24 1041.75 88.43% 19 3 12 15.79% 83 MMC 222.57 223.48 99.59% 19 4 7 21.05% 84 BSX 73.88 87.57 84.37% 24 10 8 41.67% 85 MDT 80.32 92.43 86.90% 23 4 7 17.39% 86 BA 190.6 219.35 86.89% 25 7 7 28.00% 87 ADP 262.62 264.65 99.23% 18 1 1 5.56% 88 AMT 220.4 230.39 95.66% 22 7 14 31.82% 89 PANW 324.73 343.43 94.55% 41 13 16 31.71% 90 KLAC 823.07 868.07 94.82% 14 2 4 14.29% 91 BX 142.15 135.47 104.93% 14 6 6 42.86% 92 CI 348.67 393.25 88.66% 17 6 7 35.29% 93 BMY 47.56 50.47 94.23% 22 5 4 22.73% 94 GILD 76.06 81.02 93.88% 28 2 11 7.14% 95 SCHW 65.19 73.89 88.23% 19 5 9 26.32% 96 DE 371.98 422.99 87.94% 22 4 3 18.18% 97 FI 163.57 177.14 92.34% 19 1 2 5.26% 98 UPS 130.37 144.61 90.15% 26 3 2 11.54% 99 SO 83.52 79.51 105.04% 17 1 4 5.88% 100 TMUS 182.28 197.95 92.08% 30 7 16 23.33% 101 COP 111.2 141.51 78.58% 21 6 9 28.57% Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies: Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU) I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

,"Hello everyone, I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'. This yielded the following table: + A B C D E F G H 1 Company Current Price Price Target Percent to Target Total Ratings # Strong Buy Ratings # Buy Ratings % of Ratings that were Strong Buys 2 AAPL 222.08 209.76 105.87% 38 11 21 28.95% 3 MSFT 418.35 459.66 91.01% 34 14 13 41.18% 4 NVDA 117.02 125.69 93.10% 38 14 15 36.84% 5 AMZN 186.98 206.43 90.58% 47 15 28 31.91% 6 META 474.83 490.04 96.90% 63 21 34 33.33% 7 GOOG 173.15 185.45 93.37% 5 0 3 0.00% 8 BRK.B 438.5 441.47 99.33% 6 1 3 16.67% 9 LLY 804.27 817.03 98.44% 22 9 8 40.91% 10 AVGO 160.68 180.62 88.96% 29 10 17 34.48% 11 JPM 212.8 200.66 106.05% 28 9 13 32.14% 12 TSLA 232.07 189.09 122.73% 23 0 0 0.00% 13 UNH 576.16 569.6 101.15% 22 11 11 50.00% 14 XOM 118.59 122.83 96.55% 25 5 11 20.00% 15 V 265.67 282.26 94.12% 39 13 22 33.33% 16 JNJ 157.85 158.53 99.57% 23 4 8 17.39% 17 PG 160.76 161.5 99.54% 22 6 4 27.27% 18 MA 463.71 474.87 97.65% 39 14 20 35.90% 19 HD 368.16 355.97 103.42% 33 12 12 36.36% 20 COST 822 886.84 92.69% 29 7 11 24.14% 21 WMT 68.64 68.29 100.51% 32 8 7 25.00% 22 MRK 113.13 132.14 85.61% 21 4 7 19.05% 23 BAC 40.31 41.95 96.09% 30 6 16 20.00% 24 CVX 160.47 167.84 95.61% 24 6 10 25.00% 25 NFLX 628.35 640.43 98.11% 41 11 14 26.83% 26 KO 66.74 64.8 102.99% 25 5 7 20.00% 27 CRM 258.8 274.18 94.39% 45 16 25 35.56% 28 ADBE 551.65 566.58 97.36% 31 11 14 35.48% 29 PEP 172.67 168.65 102.38% 22 10 10 45.45% 30 TMO 613.34 629.42 97.45% 15 8 6 53.33% 31 AMD 144.48 175.48 82.33% 31     0.00% 32 LIN 453.5 475.32 95.41%       #DIV/0! 33 ORCL 139.45 140.03 99.59% 36 10 16 27.78% 34 WFC 59.34 59.8 99.23% 31 4 8 12.90% 35 ACN 330.62 348.01 95.00% 29 7 9 24.14% 36 CSCO 48.45 50.56 95.83% 27 8 11 29.63% 37 MCD 265.4 276.47 96.00% 33 8 15 24.24% 38 QCOM 180.95 191.24 94.62% 23 2 7 8.70% 39 GE 170.2 171.93 98.99% 17 5   29.41% 40 ABT 105.94 124.37 85.18% 20 7 6 35.00% 41 TXN 203.81 187.18 108.88% 32 6 8 18.75% 42 DHR 277.08 284.09 97.53% 17 7 6 41.18% 43 AMGN 332.47 320.24 103.82% 25 3 7 12.00% 44 INTU 647.35 711.36 91.00% 22 6 3 27.27% 45 PM 115.16 115.74 99.50% 18 2 7 11.11% 46 PFE 30.54 29.38 103.95% 22 2 11 9.09% 47 IBM 192.14 172.59 111.33% 25 4 4 16.00% 48 DIS 93.69 123.11 76.10% 30 5 10 16.67% 49 VZ 40.52 45.6 88.86% 32 2 6 6.25% 50 CAT 346.2 337.62 102.54% 24 4 7 16.67% 51 NOW 814.39 807.1 100.90% 34 13 17 38.24% 52 AMAT 212.2 248.8 85.29% 21 4 15 19.05% 53 GS 509.03 476.64 106.80% 27 4 7 14.81% 54 CMCSA 41.27 46.36 89.02% 31 12 18 38.71% 55 SPGI 484.73 521.39 92.97% 15 1 9 6.67% 56 RTX 117.49 103.93 113.05%       #DIV/0! 57 ISRG 444.61 471.87 94.22% 17 6 5 35.29% 58 NEE 76.39 80.23 95.21% 15 5 8 33.33% 59 UNP 246.73 242.11 101.91% 29 5 7 17.24% 60 AXP 253.04 253.26 99.91% 28 6 4 21.43% 61 LOW 245.51 250.99 97.82% 32 8 10 25.00% 62 T 19.25 19.3 99.74% 30 6 3 20.00% 63 HON 204.75 226.96 90.21% 20 7 9 35.00% 64 UBER 64.47 79.96 80.63%       #DIV/0! 65 VRTX 495.72 483.91 102.44% 27 10 12 37.04% 66 MS 103.21 105.64 97.70% 27 3 14 11.11% 67 TJX 113.02 107.04 105.59% 27 9 14 33.33% 68 INTC 30.74 38.02 80.85% 41   18 0.00% 69 BKNG 3715.01 4192.39 88.61%       #DIV/0! 70 PGR 214.12 237.47 90.17% 19 5 4 26.32% 71 C 64.88 71.01 91.37% 29 5 12 17.24% 72 ELV 532.03 599.13 88.80%       #DIV/0! 73 BLK 876.5 936.85 93.56% 15 3 9 20.00% 74 PLD 126.05 135.68 92.90% 18 4 8 22.22% 75 LMT 541.92 535.31 101.23% 22 7   31.82% 76 ETN 304.79 345.86 88.13% 24 3 4 12.50% 77 REGN 1079.19 1104.34 97.72% 26 7 6 26.92% 78 MU 109.82 174.41 62.97% 31 8 20 25.81% 79 CB 275.66 277.84 99.22% 19 5 11 26.32% 80 SYK 327.45 378.81 86.44% 27 11 6 40.74% 81 ADI 231.38 255.84 90.44% 26 6 10 23.08% 82 LRCX 921.24 1041.75 88.43% 19 3 12 15.79% 83 MMC 222.57 223.48 99.59% 19 4 7 21.05% 84 BSX 73.88 87.57 84.37% 24 10 8 41.67% 85 MDT 80.32 92.43 86.90% 23 4 7 17.39% 86 BA 190.6 219.35 86.89% 25 7 7 28.00% 87 ADP 262.62 264.65 99.23% 18 1 1 5.56% 88 AMT 220.4 230.39 95.66% 22 7 14 31.82% 89 PANW 324.73 343.43 94.55% 41 13 16 31.71% 90 KLAC 823.07 868.07 94.82% 14 2 4 14.29% 91 BX 142.15 135.47 104.93% 14 6 6 42.86% 92 CI 348.67 393.25 88.66% 17 6 7 35.29% 93 BMY 47.56 50.47 94.23% 22 5 4 22.73% 94 GILD 76.06 81.02 93.88% 28 2 11 7.14% 95 SCHW 65.19 73.89 88.23% 19 5 9 26.32% 96 DE 371.98 422.99 87.94% 22 4 3 18.18% 97 FI 163.57 177.14 92.34% 19 1 2 5.26% 98 UPS 130.37 144.61 90.15% 26 3 2 11.54% 99 SO 83.52 79.51 105.04% 17 1 4 5.88% 100 TMUS 182.28 197.95 92.08% 30 7 16 23.33% 101 COP 111.2 141.51 78.58% 21 6 9 28.57% Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies: Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU) I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

,"Hello everyone, I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'. This yielded the following table: + A B C D E F G H 1 Company Current Price Price Target Percent to Target Total Ratings # Strong Buy Ratings # Buy Ratings % of Ratings that were Strong Buys 2 AAPL 222.08 209.76 105.87% 38 11 21 28.95% 3 MSFT 418.35 459.66 91.01% 34 14 13 41.18% 4 NVDA 117.02 125.69 93.10% 38 14 15 36.84% 5 AMZN 186.98 206.43 90.58% 47 15 28 31.91% 6 META 474.83 490.04 96.90% 63 21 34 33.33% 7 GOOG 173.15 185.45 93.37% 5 0 3 0.00% 8 BRK.B 438.5 441.47 99.33% 6 1 3 16.67% 9 LLY 804.27 817.03 98.44% 22 9 8 40.91% 10 AVGO 160.68 180.62 88.96% 29 10 17 34.48% 11 JPM 212.8 200.66 106.05% 28 9 13 32.14% 12 TSLA 232.07 189.09 122.73% 23 0 0 0.00% 13 UNH 576.16 569.6 101.15% 22 11 11 50.00% 14 XOM 118.59 122.83 96.55% 25 5 11 20.00% 15 V 265.67 282.26 94.12% 39 13 22 33.33% 16 JNJ 157.85 158.53 99.57% 23 4 8 17.39% 17 PG 160.76 161.5 99.54% 22 6 4 27.27% 18 MA 463.71 474.87 97.65% 39 14 20 35.90% 19 HD 368.16 355.97 103.42% 33 12 12 36.36% 20 COST 822 886.84 92.69% 29 7 11 24.14% 21 WMT 68.64 68.29 100.51% 32 8 7 25.00% 22 MRK 113.13 132.14 85.61% 21 4 7 19.05% 23 BAC 40.31 41.95 96.09% 30 6 16 20.00% 24 CVX 160.47 167.84 95.61% 24 6 10 25.00% 25 NFLX 628.35 640.43 98.11% 41 11 14 26.83% 26 KO 66.74 64.8 102.99% 25 5 7 20.00% 27 CRM 258.8 274.18 94.39% 45 16 25 35.56% 28 ADBE 551.65 566.58 97.36% 31 11 14 35.48% 29 PEP 172.67 168.65 102.38% 22 10 10 45.45% 30 TMO 613.34 629.42 97.45% 15 8 6 53.33% 31 AMD 144.48 175.48 82.33% 31     0.00% 32 LIN 453.5 475.32 95.41%       #DIV/0! 33 ORCL 139.45 140.03 99.59% 36 10 16 27.78% 34 WFC 59.34 59.8 99.23% 31 4 8 12.90% 35 ACN 330.62 348.01 95.00% 29 7 9 24.14% 36 CSCO 48.45 50.56 95.83% 27 8 11 29.63% 37 MCD 265.4 276.47 96.00% 33 8 15 24.24% 38 QCOM 180.95 191.24 94.62% 23 2 7 8.70% 39 GE 170.2 171.93 98.99% 17 5   29.41% 40 ABT 105.94 124.37 85.18% 20 7 6 35.00% 41 TXN 203.81 187.18 108.88% 32 6 8 18.75% 42 DHR 277.08 284.09 97.53% 17 7 6 41.18% 43 AMGN 332.47 320.24 103.82% 25 3 7 12.00% 44 INTU 647.35 711.36 91.00% 22 6 3 27.27% 45 PM 115.16 115.74 99.50% 18 2 7 11.11% 46 PFE 30.54 29.38 103.95% 22 2 11 9.09% 47 IBM 192.14 172.59 111.33% 25 4 4 16.00% 48 DIS 93.69 123.11 76.10% 30 5 10 16.67% 49 VZ 40.52 45.6 88.86% 32 2 6 6.25% 50 CAT 346.2 337.62 102.54% 24 4 7 16.67% 51 NOW 814.39 807.1 100.90% 34 13 17 38.24% 52 AMAT 212.2 248.8 85.29% 21 4 15 19.05% 53 GS 509.03 476.64 106.80% 27 4 7 14.81% 54 CMCSA 41.27 46.36 89.02% 31 12 18 38.71% 55 SPGI 484.73 521.39 92.97% 15 1 9 6.67% 56 RTX 117.49 103.93 113.05%       #DIV/0! 57 ISRG 444.61 471.87 94.22% 17 6 5 35.29% 58 NEE 76.39 80.23 95.21% 15 5 8 33.33% 59 UNP 246.73 242.11 101.91% 29 5 7 17.24% 60 AXP 253.04 253.26 99.91% 28 6 4 21.43% 61 LOW 245.51 250.99 97.82% 32 8 10 25.00% 62 T 19.25 19.3 99.74% 30 6 3 20.00% 63 HON 204.75 226.96 90.21% 20 7 9 35.00% 64 UBER 64.47 79.96 80.63%       #DIV/0! 65 VRTX 495.72 483.91 102.44% 27 10 12 37.04% 66 MS 103.21 105.64 97.70% 27 3 14 11.11% 67 TJX 113.02 107.04 105.59% 27 9 14 33.33% 68 INTC 30.74 38.02 80.85% 41   18 0.00% 69 BKNG 3715.01 4192.39 88.61%       #DIV/0! 70 PGR 214.12 237.47 90.17% 19 5 4 26.32% 71 C 64.88 71.01 91.37% 29 5 12 17.24% 72 ELV 532.03 599.13 88.80%       #DIV/0! 73 BLK 876.5 936.85 93.56% 15 3 9 20.00% 74 PLD 126.05 135.68 92.90% 18 4 8 22.22% 75 LMT 541.92 535.31 101.23% 22 7   31.82% 76 ETN 304.79 345.86 88.13% 24 3 4 12.50% 77 REGN 1079.19 1104.34 97.72% 26 7 6 26.92% 78 MU 109.82 174.41 62.97% 31 8 20 25.81% 79 CB 275.66 277.84 99.22% 19 5 11 26.32% 80 SYK 327.45 378.81 86.44% 27 11 6 40.74% 81 ADI 231.38 255.84 90.44% 26 6 10 23.08% 82 LRCX 921.24 1041.75 88.43% 19 3 12 15.79% 83 MMC 222.57 223.48 99.59% 19 4 7 21.05% 84 BSX 73.88 87.57 84.37% 24 10 8 41.67% 85 MDT 80.32 92.43 86.90% 23 4 7 17.39% 86 BA 190.6 219.35 86.89% 25 7 7 28.00% 87 ADP 262.62 264.65 99.23% 18 1 1 5.56% 88 AMT 220.4 230.39 95.66% 22 7 14 31.82% 89 PANW 324.73 343.43 94.55% 41 13 16 31.71% 90 KLAC 823.07 868.07 94.82% 14 2 4 14.29% 91 BX 142.15 135.47 104.93% 14 6 6 42.86% 92 CI 348.67 393.25 88.66% 17 6 7 35.29% 93 BMY 47.56 50.47 94.23% 22 5 4 22.73% 94 GILD 76.06 81.02 93.88% 28 2 11 7.14% 95 SCHW 65.19 73.89 88.23% 19 5 9 26.32% 96 DE 371.98 422.99 87.94% 22 4 3 18.18% 97 FI 163.57 177.14 92.34% 19 1 2 5.26% 98 UPS 130.37 144.61 90.15% 26 3 2 11.54% 99 SO 83.52 79.51 105.04% 17 1 4 5.88% 100 TMUS 182.28 197.95 92.08% 30 7 16 23.33% 101 COP 111.2 141.51 78.58% 21 6 9 28.57% Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies: Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU) I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

,"Hello everyone, I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'. This yielded the following table: + A B C D E F G H 1 Company Current Price Price Target Percent to Target Total Ratings # Strong Buy Ratings # Buy Ratings % of Ratings that were Strong Buys 2 AAPL 222.08 209.76 105.87% 38 11 21 28.95% 3 MSFT 418.35 459.66 91.01% 34 14 13 41.18% 4 NVDA 117.02 125.69 93.10% 38 14 15 36.84% 5 AMZN 186.98 206.43 90.58% 47 15 28 31.91% 6 META 474.83 490.04 96.90% 63 21 34 33.33% 7 GOOG 173.15 185.45 93.37% 5 0 3 0.00% 8 BRK.B 438.5 441.47 99.33% 6 1 3 16.67% 9 LLY 804.27 817.03 98.44% 22 9 8 40.91% 10 AVGO 160.68 180.62 88.96% 29 10 17 34.48% 11 JPM 212.8 200.66 106.05% 28 9 13 32.14% 12 TSLA 232.07 189.09 122.73% 23 0 0 0.00% 13 UNH 576.16 569.6 101.15% 22 11 11 50.00% 14 XOM 118.59 122.83 96.55% 25 5 11 20.00% 15 V 265.67 282.26 94.12% 39 13 22 33.33% 16 JNJ 157.85 158.53 99.57% 23 4 8 17.39% 17 PG 160.76 161.5 99.54% 22 6 4 27.27% 18 MA 463.71 474.87 97.65% 39 14 20 35.90% 19 HD 368.16 355.97 103.42% 33 12 12 36.36% 20 COST 822 886.84 92.69% 29 7 11 24.14% 21 WMT 68.64 68.29 100.51% 32 8 7 25.00% 22 MRK 113.13 132.14 85.61% 21 4 7 19.05% 23 BAC 40.31 41.95 96.09% 30 6 16 20.00% 24 CVX 160.47 167.84 95.61% 24 6 10 25.00% 25 NFLX 628.35 640.43 98.11% 41 11 14 26.83% 26 KO 66.74 64.8 102.99% 25 5 7 20.00% 27 CRM 258.8 274.18 94.39% 45 16 25 35.56% 28 ADBE 551.65 566.58 97.36% 31 11 14 35.48% 29 PEP 172.67 168.65 102.38% 22 10 10 45.45% 30 TMO 613.34 629.42 97.45% 15 8 6 53.33% 31 AMD 144.48 175.48 82.33% 31     0.00% 32 LIN 453.5 475.32 95.41%       #DIV/0! 33 ORCL 139.45 140.03 99.59% 36 10 16 27.78% 34 WFC 59.34 59.8 99.23% 31 4 8 12.90% 35 ACN 330.62 348.01 95.00% 29 7 9 24.14% 36 CSCO 48.45 50.56 95.83% 27 8 11 29.63% 37 MCD 265.4 276.47 96.00% 33 8 15 24.24% 38 QCOM 180.95 191.24 94.62% 23 2 7 8.70% 39 GE 170.2 171.93 98.99% 17 5   29.41% 40 ABT 105.94 124.37 85.18% 20 7 6 35.00% 41 TXN 203.81 187.18 108.88% 32 6 8 18.75% 42 DHR 277.08 284.09 97.53% 17 7 6 41.18% 43 AMGN 332.47 320.24 103.82% 25 3 7 12.00% 44 INTU 647.35 711.36 91.00% 22 6 3 27.27% 45 PM 115.16 115.74 99.50% 18 2 7 11.11% 46 PFE 30.54 29.38 103.95% 22 2 11 9.09% 47 IBM 192.14 172.59 111.33% 25 4 4 16.00% 48 DIS 93.69 123.11 76.10% 30 5 10 16.67% 49 VZ 40.52 45.6 88.86% 32 2 6 6.25% 50 CAT 346.2 337.62 102.54% 24 4 7 16.67% 51 NOW 814.39 807.1 100.90% 34 13 17 38.24% 52 AMAT 212.2 248.8 85.29% 21 4 15 19.05% 53 GS 509.03 476.64 106.80% 27 4 7 14.81% 54 CMCSA 41.27 46.36 89.02% 31 12 18 38.71% 55 SPGI 484.73 521.39 92.97% 15 1 9 6.67% 56 RTX 117.49 103.93 113.05%       #DIV/0! 57 ISRG 444.61 471.87 94.22% 17 6 5 35.29% 58 NEE 76.39 80.23 95.21% 15 5 8 33.33% 59 UNP 246.73 242.11 101.91% 29 5 7 17.24% 60 AXP 253.04 253.26 99.91% 28 6 4 21.43% 61 LOW 245.51 250.99 97.82% 32 8 10 25.00% 62 T 19.25 19.3 99.74% 30 6 3 20.00% 63 HON 204.75 226.96 90.21% 20 7 9 35.00% 64 UBER 64.47 79.96 80.63%       #DIV/0! 65 VRTX 495.72 483.91 102.44% 27 10 12 37.04% 66 MS 103.21 105.64 97.70% 27 3 14 11.11% 67 TJX 113.02 107.04 105.59% 27 9 14 33.33% 68 INTC 30.74 38.02 80.85% 41   18 0.00% 69 BKNG 3715.01 4192.39 88.61%       #DIV/0! 70 PGR 214.12 237.47 90.17% 19 5 4 26.32% 71 C 64.88 71.01 91.37% 29 5 12 17.24% 72 ELV 532.03 599.13 88.80%       #DIV/0! 73 BLK 876.5 936.85 93.56% 15 3 9 20.00% 74 PLD 126.05 135.68 92.90% 18 4 8 22.22% 75 LMT 541.92 535.31 101.23% 22 7   31.82% 76 ETN 304.79 345.86 88.13% 24 3 4 12.50% 77 REGN 1079.19 1104.34 97.72% 26 7 6 26.92% 78 MU 109.82 174.41 62.97% 31 8 20 25.81% 79 CB 275.66 277.84 99.22% 19 5 11 26.32% 80 SYK 327.45 378.81 86.44% 27 11 6 40.74% 81 ADI 231.38 255.84 90.44% 26 6 10 23.08% 82 LRCX 921.24 1041.75 88.43% 19 3 12 15.79% 83 MMC 222.57 223.48 99.59% 19 4 7 21.05% 84 BSX 73.88 87.57 84.37% 24 10 8 41.67% 85 MDT 80.32 92.43 86.90% 23 4 7 17.39% 86 BA 190.6 219.35 86.89% 25 7 7 28.00% 87 ADP 262.62 264.65 99.23% 18 1 1 5.56% 88 AMT 220.4 230.39 95.66% 22 7 14 31.82% 89 PANW 324.73 343.43 94.55% 41 13 16 31.71% 90 KLAC 823.07 868.07 94.82% 14 2 4 14.29% 91 BX 142.15 135.47 104.93% 14 6 6 42.86% 92 CI 348.67 393.25 88.66% 17 6 7 35.29% 93 BMY 47.56 50.47 94.23% 22 5 4 22.73% 94 GILD 76.06 81.02 93.88% 28 2 11 7.14% 95 SCHW 65.19 73.89 88.23% 19 5 9 26.32% 96 DE 371.98 422.99 87.94% 22 4 3 18.18% 97 FI 163.57 177.14 92.34% 19 1 2 5.26% 98 UPS 130.37 144.61 90.15% 26 3 2 11.54% 99 SO 83.52 79.51 105.04% 17 1 4 5.88% 100 TMUS 182.28 197.95 92.08% 30 7 16 23.33% 101 COP 111.2 141.51 78.58% 21 6 9 28.57% Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies: Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU) I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

,"Hello everyone, I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'. This yielded the following table: + A B C D E F G H 1 Company Current Price Price Target Percent to Target Total Ratings # Strong Buy Ratings # Buy Ratings % of Ratings that were Strong Buys 2 AAPL 222.08 209.76 105.87% 38 11 21 28.95% 3 MSFT 418.35 459.66 91.01% 34 14 13 41.18% 4 NVDA 117.02 125.69 93.10% 38 14 15 36.84% 5 AMZN 186.98 206.43 90.58% 47 15 28 31.91% 6 META 474.83 490.04 96.90% 63 21 34 33.33% 7 GOOG 173.15 185.45 93.37% 5 0 3 0.00% 8 BRK.B 438.5 441.47 99.33% 6 1 3 16.67% 9 LLY 804.27 817.03 98.44% 22 9 8 40.91% 10 AVGO 160.68 180.62 88.96% 29 10 17 34.48% 11 JPM 212.8 200.66 106.05% 28 9 13 32.14% 12 TSLA 232.07 189.09 122.73% 23 0 0 0.00% 13 UNH 576.16 569.6 101.15% 22 11 11 50.00% 14 XOM 118.59 122.83 96.55% 25 5 11 20.00% 15 V 265.67 282.26 94.12% 39 13 22 33.33% 16 JNJ 157.85 158.53 99.57% 23 4 8 17.39% 17 PG 160.76 161.5 99.54% 22 6 4 27.27% 18 MA 463.71 474.87 97.65% 39 14 20 35.90% 19 HD 368.16 355.97 103.42% 33 12 12 36.36% 20 COST 822 886.84 92.69% 29 7 11 24.14% 21 WMT 68.64 68.29 100.51% 32 8 7 25.00% 22 MRK 113.13 132.14 85.61% 21 4 7 19.05% 23 BAC 40.31 41.95 96.09% 30 6 16 20.00% 24 CVX 160.47 167.84 95.61% 24 6 10 25.00% 25 NFLX 628.35 640.43 98.11% 41 11 14 26.83% 26 KO 66.74 64.8 102.99% 25 5 7 20.00% 27 CRM 258.8 274.18 94.39% 45 16 25 35.56% 28 ADBE 551.65 566.58 97.36% 31 11 14 35.48% 29 PEP 172.67 168.65 102.38% 22 10 10 45.45% 30 TMO 613.34 629.42 97.45% 15 8 6 53.33% 31 AMD 144.48 175.48 82.33% 31     0.00% 32 LIN 453.5 475.32 95.41%       #DIV/0! 33 ORCL 139.45 140.03 99.59% 36 10 16 27.78% 34 WFC 59.34 59.8 99.23% 31 4 8 12.90% 35 ACN 330.62 348.01 95.00% 29 7 9 24.14% 36 CSCO 48.45 50.56 95.83% 27 8 11 29.63% 37 MCD 265.4 276.47 96.00% 33 8 15 24.24% 38 QCOM 180.95 191.24 94.62% 23 2 7 8.70% 39 GE 170.2 171.93 98.99% 17 5   29.41% 40 ABT 105.94 124.37 85.18% 20 7 6 35.00% 41 TXN 203.81 187.18 108.88% 32 6 8 18.75% 42 DHR 277.08 284.09 97.53% 17 7 6 41.18% 43 AMGN 332.47 320.24 103.82% 25 3 7 12.00% 44 INTU 647.35 711.36 91.00% 22 6 3 27.27% 45 PM 115.16 115.74 99.50% 18 2 7 11.11% 46 PFE 30.54 29.38 103.95% 22 2 11 9.09% 47 IBM 192.14 172.59 111.33% 25 4 4 16.00% 48 DIS 93.69 123.11 76.10% 30 5 10 16.67% 49 VZ 40.52 45.6 88.86% 32 2 6 6.25% 50 CAT 346.2 337.62 102.54% 24 4 7 16.67% 51 NOW 814.39 807.1 100.90% 34 13 17 38.24% 52 AMAT 212.2 248.8 85.29% 21 4 15 19.05% 53 GS 509.03 476.64 106.80% 27 4 7 14.81% 54 CMCSA 41.27 46.36 89.02% 31 12 18 38.71% 55 SPGI 484.73 521.39 92.97% 15 1 9 6.67% 56 RTX 117.49 103.93 113.05%       #DIV/0! 57 ISRG 444.61 471.87 94.22% 17 6 5 35.29% 58 NEE 76.39 80.23 95.21% 15 5 8 33.33% 59 UNP 246.73 242.11 101.91% 29 5 7 17.24% 60 AXP 253.04 253.26 99.91% 28 6 4 21.43% 61 LOW 245.51 250.99 97.82% 32 8 10 25.00% 62 T 19.25 19.3 99.74% 30 6 3 20.00% 63 HON 204.75 226.96 90.21% 20 7 9 35.00% 64 UBER 64.47 79.96 80.63%       #DIV/0! 65 VRTX 495.72 483.91 102.44% 27 10 12 37.04% 66 MS 103.21 105.64 97.70% 27 3 14 11.11% 67 TJX 113.02 107.04 105.59% 27 9 14 33.33% 68 INTC 30.74 38.02 80.85% 41   18 0.00% 69 BKNG 3715.01 4192.39 88.61%       #DIV/0! 70 PGR 214.12 237.47 90.17% 19 5 4 26.32% 71 C 64.88 71.01 91.37% 29 5 12 17.24% 72 ELV 532.03 599.13 88.80%       #DIV/0! 73 BLK 876.5 936.85 93.56% 15 3 9 20.00% 74 PLD 126.05 135.68 92.90% 18 4 8 22.22% 75 LMT 541.92 535.31 101.23% 22 7   31.82% 76 ETN 304.79 345.86 88.13% 24 3 4 12.50% 77 REGN 1079.19 1104.34 97.72% 26 7 6 26.92% 78 MU 109.82 174.41 62.97% 31 8 20 25.81% 79 CB 275.66 277.84 99.22% 19 5 11 26.32% 80 SYK 327.45 378.81 86.44% 27 11 6 40.74% 81 ADI 231.38 255.84 90.44% 26 6 10 23.08% 82 LRCX 921.24 1041.75 88.43% 19 3 12 15.79% 83 MMC 222.57 223.48 99.59% 19 4 7 21.05% 84 BSX 73.88 87.57 84.37% 24 10 8 41.67% 85 MDT 80.32 92.43 86.90% 23 4 7 17.39% 86 BA 190.6 219.35 86.89% 25 7 7 28.00% 87 ADP 262.62 264.65 99.23% 18 1 1 5.56% 88 AMT 220.4 230.39 95.66% 22 7 14 31.82% 89 PANW 324.73 343.43 94.55% 41 13 16 31.71% 90 KLAC 823.07 868.07 94.82% 14 2 4 14.29% 91 BX 142.15 135.47 104.93% 14 6 6 42.86% 92 CI 348.67 393.25 88.66% 17 6 7 35.29% 93 BMY 47.56 50.47 94.23% 22 5 4 22.73% 94 GILD 76.06 81.02 93.88% 28 2 11 7.14% 95 SCHW 65.19 73.89 88.23% 19 5 9 26.32% 96 DE 371.98 422.99 87.94% 22 4 3 18.18% 97 FI 163.57 177.14 92.34% 19 1 2 5.26% 98 UPS 130.37 144.61 90.15% 26 3 2 11.54% 99 SO 83.52 79.51 105.04% 17 1 4 5.88% 100 TMUS 182.28 197.95 92.08% 30 7 16 23.33% 101 COP 111.2 141.51 78.58% 21 6 9 28.57% Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies: Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU) I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months. What do you guys think?",I ain’t reading all that. I’m happy for you tho. Or sorry that happened,2,0.506,0.716,POSITIVE
,"Hello everyone, I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'. This yielded the following table: + A B C D E F G H 1 Company Current Price Price Target Percent to Target Total Ratings # Strong Buy Ratings # Buy Ratings % of Ratings that were Strong Buys 2 AAPL 222.08 209.76 105.87% 38 11 21 28.95% 3 MSFT 418.35 459.66 91.01% 34 14 13 41.18% 4 NVDA 117.02 125.69 93.10% 38 14 15 36.84% 5 AMZN 186.98 206.43 90.58% 47 15 28 31.91% 6 META 474.83 490.04 96.90% 63 21 34 33.33% 7 GOOG 173.15 185.45 93.37% 5 0 3 0.00% 8 BRK.B 438.5 441.47 99.33% 6 1 3 16.67% 9 LLY 804.27 817.03 98.44% 22 9 8 40.91% 10 AVGO 160.68 180.62 88.96% 29 10 17 34.48% 11 JPM 212.8 200.66 106.05% 28 9 13 32.14% 12 TSLA 232.07 189.09 122.73% 23 0 0 0.00% 13 UNH 576.16 569.6 101.15% 22 11 11 50.00% 14 XOM 118.59 122.83 96.55% 25 5 11 20.00% 15 V 265.67 282.26 94.12% 39 13 22 33.33% 16 JNJ 157.85 158.53 99.57% 23 4 8 17.39% 17 PG 160.76 161.5 99.54% 22 6 4 27.27% 18 MA 463.71 474.87 97.65% 39 14 20 35.90% 19 HD 368.16 355.97 103.42% 33 12 12 36.36% 20 COST 822 886.84 92.69% 29 7 11 24.14% 21 WMT 68.64 68.29 100.51% 32 8 7 25.00% 22 MRK 113.13 132.14 85.61% 21 4 7 19.05% 23 BAC 40.31 41.95 96.09% 30 6 16 20.00% 24 CVX 160.47 167.84 95.61% 24 6 10 25.00% 25 NFLX 628.35 640.43 98.11% 41 11 14 26.83% 26 KO 66.74 64.8 102.99% 25 5 7 20.00% 27 CRM 258.8 274.18 94.39% 45 16 25 35.56% 28 ADBE 551.65 566.58 97.36% 31 11 14 35.48% 29 PEP 172.67 168.65 102.38% 22 10 10 45.45% 30 TMO 613.34 629.42 97.45% 15 8 6 53.33% 31 AMD 144.48 175.48 82.33% 31     0.00% 32 LIN 453.5 475.32 95.41%       #DIV/0! 33 ORCL 139.45 140.03 99.59% 36 10 16 27.78% 34 WFC 59.34 59.8 99.23% 31 4 8 12.90% 35 ACN 330.62 348.01 95.00% 29 7 9 24.14% 36 CSCO 48.45 50.56 95.83% 27 8 11 29.63% 37 MCD 265.4 276.47 96.00% 33 8 15 24.24% 38 QCOM 180.95 191.24 94.62% 23 2 7 8.70% 39 GE 170.2 171.93 98.99% 17 5   29.41% 40 ABT 105.94 124.37 85.18% 20 7 6 35.00% 41 TXN 203.81 187.18 108.88% 32 6 8 18.75% 42 DHR 277.08 284.09 97.53% 17 7 6 41.18% 43 AMGN 332.47 320.24 103.82% 25 3 7 12.00% 44 INTU 647.35 711.36 91.00% 22 6 3 27.27% 45 PM 115.16 115.74 99.50% 18 2 7 11.11% 46 PFE 30.54 29.38 103.95% 22 2 11 9.09% 47 IBM 192.14 172.59 111.33% 25 4 4 16.00% 48 DIS 93.69 123.11 76.10% 30 5 10 16.67% 49 VZ 40.52 45.6 88.86% 32 2 6 6.25% 50 CAT 346.2 337.62 102.54% 24 4 7 16.67% 51 NOW 814.39 807.1 100.90% 34 13 17 38.24% 52 AMAT 212.2 248.8 85.29% 21 4 15 19.05% 53 GS 509.03 476.64 106.80% 27 4 7 14.81% 54 CMCSA 41.27 46.36 89.02% 31 12 18 38.71% 55 SPGI 484.73 521.39 92.97% 15 1 9 6.67% 56 RTX 117.49 103.93 113.05%       #DIV/0! 57 ISRG 444.61 471.87 94.22% 17 6 5 35.29% 58 NEE 76.39 80.23 95.21% 15 5 8 33.33% 59 UNP 246.73 242.11 101.91% 29 5 7 17.24% 60 AXP 253.04 253.26 99.91% 28 6 4 21.43% 61 LOW 245.51 250.99 97.82% 32 8 10 25.00% 62 T 19.25 19.3 99.74% 30 6 3 20.00% 63 HON 204.75 226.96 90.21% 20 7 9 35.00% 64 UBER 64.47 79.96 80.63%       #DIV/0! 65 VRTX 495.72 483.91 102.44% 27 10 12 37.04% 66 MS 103.21 105.64 97.70% 27 3 14 11.11% 67 TJX 113.02 107.04 105.59% 27 9 14 33.33% 68 INTC 30.74 38.02 80.85% 41   18 0.00% 69 BKNG 3715.01 4192.39 88.61%       #DIV/0! 70 PGR 214.12 237.47 90.17% 19 5 4 26.32% 71 C 64.88 71.01 91.37% 29 5 12 17.24% 72 ELV 532.03 599.13 88.80%       #DIV/0! 73 BLK 876.5 936.85 93.56% 15 3 9 20.00% 74 PLD 126.05 135.68 92.90% 18 4 8 22.22% 75 LMT 541.92 535.31 101.23% 22 7   31.82% 76 ETN 304.79 345.86 88.13% 24 3 4 12.50% 77 REGN 1079.19 1104.34 97.72% 26 7 6 26.92% 78 MU 109.82 174.41 62.97% 31 8 20 25.81% 79 CB 275.66 277.84 99.22% 19 5 11 26.32% 80 SYK 327.45 378.81 86.44% 27 11 6 40.74% 81 ADI 231.38 255.84 90.44% 26 6 10 23.08% 82 LRCX 921.24 1041.75 88.43% 19 3 12 15.79% 83 MMC 222.57 223.48 99.59% 19 4 7 21.05% 84 BSX 73.88 87.57 84.37% 24 10 8 41.67% 85 MDT 80.32 92.43 86.90% 23 4 7 17.39% 86 BA 190.6 219.35 86.89% 25 7 7 28.00% 87 ADP 262.62 264.65 99.23% 18 1 1 5.56% 88 AMT 220.4 230.39 95.66% 22 7 14 31.82% 89 PANW 324.73 343.43 94.55% 41 13 16 31.71% 90 KLAC 823.07 868.07 94.82% 14 2 4 14.29% 91 BX 142.15 135.47 104.93% 14 6 6 42.86% 92 CI 348.67 393.25 88.66% 17 6 7 35.29% 93 BMY 47.56 50.47 94.23% 22 5 4 22.73% 94 GILD 76.06 81.02 93.88% 28 2 11 7.14% 95 SCHW 65.19 73.89 88.23% 19 5 9 26.32% 96 DE 371.98 422.99 87.94% 22 4 3 18.18% 97 FI 163.57 177.14 92.34% 19 1 2 5.26% 98 UPS 130.37 144.61 90.15% 26 3 2 11.54% 99 SO 83.52 79.51 105.04% 17 1 4 5.88% 100 TMUS 182.28 197.95 92.08% 30 7 16 23.33% 101 COP 111.2 141.51 78.58% 21 6 9 28.57% Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies: Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU) I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

,"Hello everyone, I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'. This yielded the following table: + A B C D E F G H 1 Company Current Price Price Target Percent to Target Total Ratings # Strong Buy Ratings # Buy Ratings % of Ratings that were Strong Buys 2 AAPL 222.08 209.76 105.87% 38 11 21 28.95% 3 MSFT 418.35 459.66 91.01% 34 14 13 41.18% 4 NVDA 117.02 125.69 93.10% 38 14 15 36.84% 5 AMZN 186.98 206.43 90.58% 47 15 28 31.91% 6 META 474.83 490.04 96.90% 63 21 34 33.33% 7 GOOG 173.15 185.45 93.37% 5 0 3 0.00% 8 BRK.B 438.5 441.47 99.33% 6 1 3 16.67% 9 LLY 804.27 817.03 98.44% 22 9 8 40.91% 10 AVGO 160.68 180.62 88.96% 29 10 17 34.48% 11 JPM 212.8 200.66 106.05% 28 9 13 32.14% 12 TSLA 232.07 189.09 122.73% 23 0 0 0.00% 13 UNH 576.16 569.6 101.15% 22 11 11 50.00% 14 XOM 118.59 122.83 96.55% 25 5 11 20.00% 15 V 265.67 282.26 94.12% 39 13 22 33.33% 16 JNJ 157.85 158.53 99.57% 23 4 8 17.39% 17 PG 160.76 161.5 99.54% 22 6 4 27.27% 18 MA 463.71 474.87 97.65% 39 14 20 35.90% 19 HD 368.16 355.97 103.42% 33 12 12 36.36% 20 COST 822 886.84 92.69% 29 7 11 24.14% 21 WMT 68.64 68.29 100.51% 32 8 7 25.00% 22 MRK 113.13 132.14 85.61% 21 4 7 19.05% 23 BAC 40.31 41.95 96.09% 30 6 16 20.00% 24 CVX 160.47 167.84 95.61% 24 6 10 25.00% 25 NFLX 628.35 640.43 98.11% 41 11 14 26.83% 26 KO 66.74 64.8 102.99% 25 5 7 20.00% 27 CRM 258.8 274.18 94.39% 45 16 25 35.56% 28 ADBE 551.65 566.58 97.36% 31 11 14 35.48% 29 PEP 172.67 168.65 102.38% 22 10 10 45.45% 30 TMO 613.34 629.42 97.45% 15 8 6 53.33% 31 AMD 144.48 175.48 82.33% 31     0.00% 32 LIN 453.5 475.32 95.41%       #DIV/0! 33 ORCL 139.45 140.03 99.59% 36 10 16 27.78% 34 WFC 59.34 59.8 99.23% 31 4 8 12.90% 35 ACN 330.62 348.01 95.00% 29 7 9 24.14% 36 CSCO 48.45 50.56 95.83% 27 8 11 29.63% 37 MCD 265.4 276.47 96.00% 33 8 15 24.24% 38 QCOM 180.95 191.24 94.62% 23 2 7 8.70% 39 GE 170.2 171.93 98.99% 17 5   29.41% 40 ABT 105.94 124.37 85.18% 20 7 6 35.00% 41 TXN 203.81 187.18 108.88% 32 6 8 18.75% 42 DHR 277.08 284.09 97.53% 17 7 6 41.18% 43 AMGN 332.47 320.24 103.82% 25 3 7 12.00% 44 INTU 647.35 711.36 91.00% 22 6 3 27.27% 45 PM 115.16 115.74 99.50% 18 2 7 11.11% 46 PFE 30.54 29.38 103.95% 22 2 11 9.09% 47 IBM 192.14 172.59 111.33% 25 4 4 16.00% 48 DIS 93.69 123.11 76.10% 30 5 10 16.67% 49 VZ 40.52 45.6 88.86% 32 2 6 6.25% 50 CAT 346.2 337.62 102.54% 24 4 7 16.67% 51 NOW 814.39 807.1 100.90% 34 13 17 38.24% 52 AMAT 212.2 248.8 85.29% 21 4 15 19.05% 53 GS 509.03 476.64 106.80% 27 4 7 14.81% 54 CMCSA 41.27 46.36 89.02% 31 12 18 38.71% 55 SPGI 484.73 521.39 92.97% 15 1 9 6.67% 56 RTX 117.49 103.93 113.05%       #DIV/0! 57 ISRG 444.61 471.87 94.22% 17 6 5 35.29% 58 NEE 76.39 80.23 95.21% 15 5 8 33.33% 59 UNP 246.73 242.11 101.91% 29 5 7 17.24% 60 AXP 253.04 253.26 99.91% 28 6 4 21.43% 61 LOW 245.51 250.99 97.82% 32 8 10 25.00% 62 T 19.25 19.3 99.74% 30 6 3 20.00% 63 HON 204.75 226.96 90.21% 20 7 9 35.00% 64 UBER 64.47 79.96 80.63%       #DIV/0! 65 VRTX 495.72 483.91 102.44% 27 10 12 37.04% 66 MS 103.21 105.64 97.70% 27 3 14 11.11% 67 TJX 113.02 107.04 105.59% 27 9 14 33.33% 68 INTC 30.74 38.02 80.85% 41   18 0.00% 69 BKNG 3715.01 4192.39 88.61%       #DIV/0! 70 PGR 214.12 237.47 90.17% 19 5 4 26.32% 71 C 64.88 71.01 91.37% 29 5 12 17.24% 72 ELV 532.03 599.13 88.80%       #DIV/0! 73 BLK 876.5 936.85 93.56% 15 3 9 20.00% 74 PLD 126.05 135.68 92.90% 18 4 8 22.22% 75 LMT 541.92 535.31 101.23% 22 7   31.82% 76 ETN 304.79 345.86 88.13% 24 3 4 12.50% 77 REGN 1079.19 1104.34 97.72% 26 7 6 26.92% 78 MU 109.82 174.41 62.97% 31 8 20 25.81% 79 CB 275.66 277.84 99.22% 19 5 11 26.32% 80 SYK 327.45 378.81 86.44% 27 11 6 40.74% 81 ADI 231.38 255.84 90.44% 26 6 10 23.08% 82 LRCX 921.24 1041.75 88.43% 19 3 12 15.79% 83 MMC 222.57 223.48 99.59% 19 4 7 21.05% 84 BSX 73.88 87.57 84.37% 24 10 8 41.67% 85 MDT 80.32 92.43 86.90% 23 4 7 17.39% 86 BA 190.6 219.35 86.89% 25 7 7 28.00% 87 ADP 262.62 264.65 99.23% 18 1 1 5.56% 88 AMT 220.4 230.39 95.66% 22 7 14 31.82% 89 PANW 324.73 343.43 94.55% 41 13 16 31.71% 90 KLAC 823.07 868.07 94.82% 14 2 4 14.29% 91 BX 142.15 135.47 104.93% 14 6 6 42.86% 92 CI 348.67 393.25 88.66% 17 6 7 35.29% 93 BMY 47.56 50.47 94.23% 22 5 4 22.73% 94 GILD 76.06 81.02 93.88% 28 2 11 7.14% 95 SCHW 65.19 73.89 88.23% 19 5 9 26.32% 96 DE 371.98 422.99 87.94% 22 4 3 18.18% 97 FI 163.57 177.14 92.34% 19 1 2 5.26% 98 UPS 130.37 144.61 90.15% 26 3 2 11.54% 99 SO 83.52 79.51 105.04% 17 1 4 5.88% 100 TMUS 182.28 197.95 92.08% 30 7 16 23.33% 101 COP 111.2 141.51 78.58% 21 6 9 28.57% Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies: Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU) I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

,"Hello everyone, I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes. One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies. Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed. So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'. This yielded the following table: + A B C D E F G H 1 Company Current Price Price Target Percent to Target Total Ratings # Strong Buy Ratings # Buy Ratings % of Ratings that were Strong Buys 2 AAPL 222.08 209.76 105.87% 38 11 21 28.95% 3 MSFT 418.35 459.66 91.01% 34 14 13 41.18% 4 NVDA 117.02 125.69 93.10% 38 14 15 36.84% 5 AMZN 186.98 206.43 90.58% 47 15 28 31.91% 6 META 474.83 490.04 96.90% 63 21 34 33.33% 7 GOOG 173.15 185.45 93.37% 5 0 3 0.00% 8 BRK.B 438.5 441.47 99.33% 6 1 3 16.67% 9 LLY 804.27 817.03 98.44% 22 9 8 40.91% 10 AVGO 160.68 180.62 88.96% 29 10 17 34.48% 11 JPM 212.8 200.66 106.05% 28 9 13 32.14% 12 TSLA 232.07 189.09 122.73% 23 0 0 0.00% 13 UNH 576.16 569.6 101.15% 22 11 11 50.00% 14 XOM 118.59 122.83 96.55% 25 5 11 20.00% 15 V 265.67 282.26 94.12% 39 13 22 33.33% 16 JNJ 157.85 158.53 99.57% 23 4 8 17.39% 17 PG 160.76 161.5 99.54% 22 6 4 27.27% 18 MA 463.71 474.87 97.65% 39 14 20 35.90% 19 HD 368.16 355.97 103.42% 33 12 12 36.36% 20 COST 822 886.84 92.69% 29 7 11 24.14% 21 WMT 68.64 68.29 100.51% 32 8 7 25.00% 22 MRK 113.13 132.14 85.61% 21 4 7 19.05% 23 BAC 40.31 41.95 96.09% 30 6 16 20.00% 24 CVX 160.47 167.84 95.61% 24 6 10 25.00% 25 NFLX 628.35 640.43 98.11% 41 11 14 26.83% 26 KO 66.74 64.8 102.99% 25 5 7 20.00% 27 CRM 258.8 274.18 94.39% 45 16 25 35.56% 28 ADBE 551.65 566.58 97.36% 31 11 14 35.48% 29 PEP 172.67 168.65 102.38% 22 10 10 45.45% 30 TMO 613.34 629.42 97.45% 15 8 6 53.33% 31 AMD 144.48 175.48 82.33% 31     0.00% 32 LIN 453.5 475.32 95.41%       #DIV/0! 33 ORCL 139.45 140.03 99.59% 36 10 16 27.78% 34 WFC 59.34 59.8 99.23% 31 4 8 12.90% 35 ACN 330.62 348.01 95.00% 29 7 9 24.14% 36 CSCO 48.45 50.56 95.83% 27 8 11 29.63% 37 MCD 265.4 276.47 96.00% 33 8 15 24.24% 38 QCOM 180.95 191.24 94.62% 23 2 7 8.70% 39 GE 170.2 171.93 98.99% 17 5   29.41% 40 ABT 105.94 124.37 85.18% 20 7 6 35.00% 41 TXN 203.81 187.18 108.88% 32 6 8 18.75% 42 DHR 277.08 284.09 97.53% 17 7 6 41.18% 43 AMGN 332.47 320.24 103.82% 25 3 7 12.00% 44 INTU 647.35 711.36 91.00% 22 6 3 27.27% 45 PM 115.16 115.74 99.50% 18 2 7 11.11% 46 PFE 30.54 29.38 103.95% 22 2 11 9.09% 47 IBM 192.14 172.59 111.33% 25 4 4 16.00% 48 DIS 93.69 123.11 76.10% 30 5 10 16.67% 49 VZ 40.52 45.6 88.86% 32 2 6 6.25% 50 CAT 346.2 337.62 102.54% 24 4 7 16.67% 51 NOW 814.39 807.1 100.90% 34 13 17 38.24% 52 AMAT 212.2 248.8 85.29% 21 4 15 19.05% 53 GS 509.03 476.64 106.80% 27 4 7 14.81% 54 CMCSA 41.27 46.36 89.02% 31 12 18 38.71% 55 SPGI 484.73 521.39 92.97% 15 1 9 6.67% 56 RTX 117.49 103.93 113.05%       #DIV/0! 57 ISRG 444.61 471.87 94.22% 17 6 5 35.29% 58 NEE 76.39 80.23 95.21% 15 5 8 33.33% 59 UNP 246.73 242.11 101.91% 29 5 7 17.24% 60 AXP 253.04 253.26 99.91% 28 6 4 21.43% 61 LOW 245.51 250.99 97.82% 32 8 10 25.00% 62 T 19.25 19.3 99.74% 30 6 3 20.00% 63 HON 204.75 226.96 90.21% 20 7 9 35.00% 64 UBER 64.47 79.96 80.63%       #DIV/0! 65 VRTX 495.72 483.91 102.44% 27 10 12 37.04% 66 MS 103.21 105.64 97.70% 27 3 14 11.11% 67 TJX 113.02 107.04 105.59% 27 9 14 33.33% 68 INTC 30.74 38.02 80.85% 41   18 0.00% 69 BKNG 3715.01 4192.39 88.61%       #DIV/0! 70 PGR 214.12 237.47 90.17% 19 5 4 26.32% 71 C 64.88 71.01 91.37% 29 5 12 17.24% 72 ELV 532.03 599.13 88.80%       #DIV/0! 73 BLK 876.5 936.85 93.56% 15 3 9 20.00% 74 PLD 126.05 135.68 92.90% 18 4 8 22.22% 75 LMT 541.92 535.31 101.23% 22 7   31.82% 76 ETN 304.79 345.86 88.13% 24 3 4 12.50% 77 REGN 1079.19 1104.34 97.72% 26 7 6 26.92% 78 MU 109.82 174.41 62.97% 31 8 20 25.81% 79 CB 275.66 277.84 99.22% 19 5 11 26.32% 80 SYK 327.45 378.81 86.44% 27 11 6 40.74% 81 ADI 231.38 255.84 90.44% 26 6 10 23.08% 82 LRCX 921.24 1041.75 88.43% 19 3 12 15.79% 83 MMC 222.57 223.48 99.59% 19 4 7 21.05% 84 BSX 73.88 87.57 84.37% 24 10 8 41.67% 85 MDT 80.32 92.43 86.90% 23 4 7 17.39% 86 BA 190.6 219.35 86.89% 25 7 7 28.00% 87 ADP 262.62 264.65 99.23% 18 1 1 5.56% 88 AMT 220.4 230.39 95.66% 22 7 14 31.82% 89 PANW 324.73 343.43 94.55% 41 13 16 31.71% 90 KLAC 823.07 868.07 94.82% 14 2 4 14.29% 91 BX 142.15 135.47 104.93% 14 6 6 42.86% 92 CI 348.67 393.25 88.66% 17 6 7 35.29% 93 BMY 47.56 50.47 94.23% 22 5 4 22.73% 94 GILD 76.06 81.02 93.88% 28 2 11 7.14% 95 SCHW 65.19 73.89 88.23% 19 5 9 26.32% 96 DE 371.98 422.99 87.94% 22 4 3 18.18% 97 FI 163.57 177.14 92.34% 19 1 2 5.26% 98 UPS 130.37 144.61 90.15% 26 3 2 11.54% 99 SO 83.52 79.51 105.04% 17 1 4 5.88% 100 TMUS 182.28 197.95 92.08% 30 7 16 23.33% 101 COP 111.2 141.51 78.58% 21 6 9 28.57% Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies: Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU) I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months. What do you guys think?","I also look at Morningstar analyst report (because they are definitely more independent than the sell side analysts of investment companies). For instance, NVDA fair price is $105 according to M* (compared to $125.69 in your table) . So, I am holding for NVDA to drop at least 10% lower than M* fair price before directing some funds towards NVDA. GOOGL A $181 M*. So, this may be a better buy now at $160 level.",0,0.563,0.999,NEGATIVE
