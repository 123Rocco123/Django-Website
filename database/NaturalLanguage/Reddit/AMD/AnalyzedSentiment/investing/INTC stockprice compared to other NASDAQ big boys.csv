,"So help me out here, NASDAQ took a pretty fat L today, companies similar to INTC like AMD and NVDA have gone down massively the last couple of days and somehow INTC is just chilling... Is this positive or bad news as a whole for the company. Any insights would be greatly appreciated. Also let's say the AMD remours around TSLA are true, would that have a positive effect? You'd think so right?","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

Not to mention pinning their CPUs thermal limits while AMD innovated and this year became the market leader in desktop CPU performance (especially gaming).My take: AMD and especially NVDA are overvalued. INTC is under valued (apparently ~40%), and is probably getting much less investor eyes b/c they are now a mature “me too” company. No longer an innovator or market leader, with less future growth potential.This is paired with AMD and NVDA notably becoming “darlings” in the tech world. Even with a fraction of the earnings AMD was toping out 2x INTC price this year.",0,0.578,0.999,NEGATIVE

You'd think so right?","Imagine a CPU company not innovating in a world where CPU speed and innovation is exponential.Why would you chance it?They are supposed to lose Apple as it's expected or has announced it's going with a different cpu, intel is so far behind in the datacenter innovation their cpus aren't even the king of speed except for maybe a few cherry picked benches, definitely not the best in cores, definitely not the best in thermal or power efficiency, definitely definitely not the best in security. You've got a few fanboys that might go with intel for their desktop single core speed but I'm sure amd has caught them there too without using industrial coolers.So Intel's far behind in cores, efficiency, thermal, security, there's a huge brain drain there. Their modem business was a huge failure, their GPU business is also a huge failure. I'm not sure where the deal is? or where the turnaround would be?If you want in on semiconductor stocks go with amd, nvda, tsmc or any other one, you don't want to own a semiconductor stock that is technologically stagnant, this isn't the field to be in if you're going to be stagnant",1,0.555,1.0,NEGATIVE

I bought in when they crashed but sold off again for good after AMD dominated this fall (and it continued to fall/decline).",1,0.556,1.0,NEGATIVE

They need engineers rather than bean counters or attorneys in charge. They still have a meaningful brand and a lot of cash to work with. But yes, they've fallen way behind the competition of late. Hard to believe when you look at their sales they are still almost 10 x bigger than AMD.",0,0.543,0.988,NEGATIVE
