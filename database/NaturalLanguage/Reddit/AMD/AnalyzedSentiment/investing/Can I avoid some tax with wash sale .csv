,"(sorry for the ambiguous title) Here is the situation: Let's say I have 150 share RDS @ $20 (long term gain $3000) 100 sahre AMD @ 120 (short term loss $5000) with 50 share ($6000) on margin So, if I just sell RDS to pay off the margin, I have some tax consequence (long term capital gain $3000). What if I buy another 50 AMD first, and then sell my RDS (total gain of the year is $3000), and then sell 50 AMD at $65 (FIFO method for short term loss of about -$2750) ? If I understand the wash sale correctly, the buy back is only apply AFTER you sell. In above case, the purchase is BEFORE, and I should be able to harvest the loss. Correct ? Let me know what you think ?",Be sure to wait at least 31 days after buying AMD before you sell AMD (and wait another 31 days after before you buy more if you decide you want back in).,0,0.585,1.0,NEGATIVE
