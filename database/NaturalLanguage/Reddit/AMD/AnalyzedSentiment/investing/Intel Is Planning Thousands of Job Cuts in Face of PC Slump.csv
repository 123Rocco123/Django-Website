Unlike something like professional baseball, replete with objective metrics to measure a player's worth, executives have only a highly subjective resume to draw upon when deciding whether or not to hire them. And even evaluating a CEO after a few fiscal years may be difficult; they could be pulling a Jack Welch and stripping the company bare for short-term gains.And this is all assuming that hierarchal control systems produce the most efficient outcomes; perhaps democratic control may be more advantageous, and reduce business risks that come with one biased individual holding all the cards.Math shows that reducing executive compensation alone will, in the case of many companies, have a small effect on total labor costs. But to deny the frustration that working people have with the executive class is foolhardy. C-Suite types are not subject to any of the same downward pressures on compensation that lower wage/salary earners are; factors such as immigration, automation, downsizing, etc.It would be a real hoot if shareholders/boards treated CEOs the way they do wage earners. Pay them as little as the market will bear, outsource their jobs, import visa-holding immigrants to compete with them in the labor market1, and threaten them with automation.1 One thing I've always found quite interesting is the corporate world's huge blindspot in this regard. There are thousands of skilled entrepreneurs and managers helming large organizations throughout the globe, who could very well outdo domestic talent with proper scouting. This is the same logic applied to workers vis-a-vis immigration or globalization, but is absent in the mainstream discourse. Odd, no?",4,0.518,1.0,NEGATIVE

Doing so will cost way more than millions you can save by cheaping out on their compensation.Their past performance and reputation definitely is not foul-proof metric but the alternative of lowering the bar is even worse. Not sure what you meant by immigrants. Those who are worth the salt will command a premium and market price just like any native CEO. There is no free lunch under any efficient market.Besides, majority of CEO compensation structure is vested stock. They don’t get these unless they hit their quota and performance target.

There's a ton of ways in which costs of officer compensation could be reduced without a hit to quality.Take for instance your example of Musk. While he's not a perfect example, given that he's practically the owner of Tesla (thus not an employee/manager subject to moral hazard), the idea of heavier weighting on equity-based compensation is probably something many companies should do for the c-suite, to be align management with long-term shareholder goals. Yet when you read 10-Ks and proxy statements, lots of firms are paying out huge salaries to their officers in addition to equity stakes and sweetheart stock options.There's certainly room to trim. And that's all assuming that the contemporary corporate structure for high-level decision making is the best and most efficient...not necessarily a settled fact. Maybe there are some ""great men of history"" types of top management, who can truly steer a company mostly on their own. Or maybe their effectively a placebo.As a shareholder, you don't want any waste, so executive compensation should not be treated as sacrosanct, and should be investigated and optimized as ruthlessly as any other part of the enterprise. To reiterate, I do not think this is the case, and that corporate officers (for whatever reason) enjoy many special privileges in their paychecks as well as the discourse.As a working class person...well, that's a little bit more political and outside the scope of this sub.",6,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE
