Next year amd is going to have 8 to 10 billion in cpu sales to the Datacenter market, if not more because Intel will not have anything remotely comparable until end of 2024.Amd will start cutting through the CUDA moat as well starting next year because two of the worlds fastest and energy efficient supercomputers will run with amd's Datacenter gpu devices on open source software.Nvda's mellanox market will aslo be under attack through amd's pensando acquisition.Amd will grow revenues and eps next year in the range of 15 to 25% even with a recession. I suspect Nvidia will not be able to do the same. Even if they did, the forward PE for 20% growth is unwarranted.This year amd will clock in faster revenue growth than nvda compared to previous year. Nvda avoided providing q4 guidance during the last ER. I wonder why? They only provided q3 guide. None of the genius analysts asked about whether the full year guidance should be revised down during the call because all of their reputations we're on the line when they pumped nvda stock target prices into outer space without realizing how much of nvda's growth through q1 this year was driven by crypto sales.",2,0.608,1.0,NEGATIVE

I just started a small position in INTC, primarily for the dividend and the hope of a nice rebound.My fav semi stock is TSM. Bit of a slow grower but steady. Decent dividend.

Happy investing!","The opposite is happening though, Intel does need to get their shit together but they have committed to building more foundries for advanced chip production in the US. I'm invested in both, but personally I think Intel is in a position where it cannot fail and is likely to come back in a big way. With the dividend and the price it has been at recently, I think its all upside. They run one of the few fab operations in the US, and they produce and sell their own chips. This differentiates them from TSM, NVDA, and AMD. AMD and NVDA outsource production to TSM, and TSM solely produces semiconductors. AMD and NVDA then use those in their chips - INTC produces their own semis and their own chips.They are also one of the very few companies in the world that can produce the most advanced chips, and they have the capacity and funds to commit to both the research and production of them. Sure they're behind TSM, but so is essentially everyone, and with the weight of the DoD I don't see the U.S. govt. ever allowing INTL to flounder - it would be a national security threat. More than that, INTL has partnerships with DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.My time horizon is very long term, 30+ years. I think any semiconductor industry stock is going to explode in that timeframe. Consumer demand for electronics, and increasingly complex electronics, is not going anywhere. Government demand will likely go through the roof if we really do find ourselves entrenched in some sort of Cold War II, and tech development will be the new arms race.",1,0.545,0.943,POSITIVE

SOXX does slightly better than SMH, but why decide? Just get all three. They all have different baskets. Maybe AMD will be the dominant company going forward and will be more featured in one than the other two. Also, XSD is a bit better but far smaller, so having the bigger two also could be comforting.Individual stocks, the equipment and quality control stocks are a safer bet in troubled times since they are required no matter what. SNPS, CDNS, KLAC, etc. Once it is clear we are moving up rather than down AMD seems the more sure bet, but ON and NVDA are also both easy longterm bets.

When I didn't know better I put some money in Semiconductors and did well, now I rather have a well diversified portfolio with factor tilts and a bit of leverage.For the individual stocks:NVDA: PE ratio of 45 == overbought. However, it can still go up for a while, or take a 50% haircut, who knows. It will reverse eventually.AMD: PE ratio of 34 == slightly overboughtINTC: PE ratio of 6 == way oversold. Unless they go bankrupt they will reverse to the mean and jump in price eventually.When will things happen? I don't know, but keep in mind the stock prices include future return expectations. NVDA and AMD need to surpass their already hyped future expectations to keep going up in value. However momentum alone can carry them for a minute. Where INTC, despite the nay sayers, has to clear baked-in low expectations to increase in value. Think about it this way, clearing a low bar is just easier.Lastly, I want to point out that a decade ago people used to look down on AMD as inferior to Intel. Many swore Intel would always be the leader. Now scripts have flipped. What I'm saying is, no one knows for sure, and all the AMD cheerleaders are no better than the INTC cheerleaders before its tumble.",0,0.541,1.0,NEGATIVE

They still have the largest revenue of any company in the semiconductor industry.Are they down roughly 50% from their ATH and where they were like a year and a half ago? Yes, so are NVDA, AMD, TSM, etc. It also has its own foundries in the US, which is a huge thing the Department of Defense is looking at as a national security issue. AMD and NVDA outsource their advanced semis from TSM and then put them into their respective chips. INTC doesn't have quite the tech level TSM does with their semis, nor does anyone else in the game. But INTC is investing in that right now, and they produce both the semis and the chips and processors that use them.INTC has established relationships with the DoD and the DARPA program, in essence making them a state-supported entity with backing from the US military. IMO the chance of the company terminally declining or anything like that are near zero, because it would effectively be a national security issue. So worst case is basically INTC slowly climbs back up, maybe to the $60-70 range, over the next 5-10 years while paying a high dividend. Best case is their R&D into smaller chips actually pays off, their US factories get up and running, and they compete with TSM because companies like NVDA and AMD eventually order a share of their semis from INTC.",2,0.554,0.6,POSITIVE

And the upcoming depression will impact Intel less than AMD due to positive cash flow. AMD had it‚Äôs time like it did. in the Pentium 4 era. Look at the chart back then. Intel is awake since 2 years and next year the impact on AMD will be visible. From that on Intel will use Chiplet Design themselves.

I think for efficiency there is ARM and custom chips anyways. So not really that relevant for amd and Intel. For x86 it‚Äôs technology fit to the remaining parts (Intel Leads here) and cost efficiency (amd leads here).For sure amd will lose big on GPUs in the coming quarters. The cycle is done for the next months and maybe years with looming depression.TSMC is of course the one with the best scale. But they sell and keep margin for themselves. Intel produces for themselves and keeps the margins. Intel doesn‚Äôt have to pay a producer and lose margin. So there is not that much benefit for amd. In addition Dollar and Euro is losing its value against Asian currencies and the looming escalation with Taiwan holds risks to the supply chain. I could imagine that once plants overseas are built TSMC will lose relevance to a certain degree.But let‚Äôs see and watch where amd will be and Intel will be next year at this time.
