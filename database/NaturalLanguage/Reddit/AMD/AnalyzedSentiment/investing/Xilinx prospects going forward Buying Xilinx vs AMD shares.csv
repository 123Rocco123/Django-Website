,"Do y'all think Xilinx will go up down or remain flat at this point? I am interesting in buying AMD. But assuming this deal closes, it seems like a better value to buy Xlininx shares before they are converted to AMD shares. It costs less and gets you the AMD shares for a better valuation it seems. Currently Xilinx shares are ~$123. They are worth 1.7 amd shares if the deal closes. 123/1.7 = ~72.40 per amd share which is better than the current amd share price of ~$78. So, the question becomes, do we think Xilinx will go up down or remain flat? I might just DCA into it. Also does anyone know how likely it is for deals like this to close or fall apart? Lastly, is there a good estimate of when/how soon the deal is supposed to close?","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

Lastly, is there a good estimate of when/how soon the deal is supposed to close?",I would assume that as the deal gets closer to closing XLNX trades closer to 1.7 AMD shares. The difference must be the markets estimate of the risk of the deal falling through. I don't know how we find out the progress on it other than waiting for press releases or news from regulatory committees.,0,0.539,0.993,NEGATIVE

Lastly, is there a good estimate of when/how soon the deal is supposed to close?",There is always a spread after an acquisition is announced reflecting the risk of a deal falling through. Not at all unique to this situation.,0,0.526,1.0,NEGATIVE
