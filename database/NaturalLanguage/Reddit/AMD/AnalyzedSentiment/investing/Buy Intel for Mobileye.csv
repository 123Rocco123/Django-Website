Extreme low price earnings ratio, It has tons of revenue, profit per share keeps rising, through Intel capital it owns shares in loads of tech companies, it has tons of production capacity that can be used to produce lots and lots of chips (if needed at lower margin than the current 50% it is revenue for years) , they own ip they cloud license, have some interesting new tech coming up, and the us government/intelligence/military would never want to loose hi tech chip production capacity at home..",1,0.544,0.984,POSITIVE

Their growth will be lower but it doesn't matter with these share prices. I am happy with 0% growth and and them buying back 5% of the shares each year + paying dividend. Every little bit of growth is a bonus and they keep delivering.They will never again dominate the whole market like they did in the past but the market is so big there will always be opportunities for them.

But they hold more self driving data, more than anybody in the world. Their ADAS have been in multiple countries even before TSLA started training their DL model. Plus the co founder of Mobileeye is somewhat open when it comes to claims and know-how implementation of Autonomous driving tech; with Elon big problem is not accepting something is possible. TSLA simply doesn't want Lidar instead of trying to reduce the cost of LIDAR.There is also certain level of threshold DL can do -- Tesla uses camera and Deep learning to do so autonomous driving but you would need another independent system to do fault correction atleast for quite bit of time. MobileEye is somewhat aware about this and they use 3D maps to navigate the real world intandem to camera's and their concept is to commercialize with robotaxis and roll it to public in a 5-10 year span when LIDAR costs can be subsidized. Also if you closely follow TSLA in last three year developments in self driving, almost every technical implementation closely imitates what MobileEye have done or proposed after the break in partnership. If I have to bet one company who can make robotaxis possible, it would be MobileEye. Their ADAS is relatively superior and they know what they're doing and being private is quite good for them rather than the hype. As TSLA investor and paying $8k for FSD which is supposed to be here in 2020. It's just frustrating apart from occasional memes.",1,0.534,0.981,NEGATIVE

They are going nowhere fast, their problems of the past continue to haunt them and I've heard a lot about the company being a completely toxic work environment that continues to stall innovation.But they do have some things going for them. They are in basically every PC and even a lot of phones as they have a strong hold on things like wireless chips and other small components. They also have a tonne of capacity of their own, that's doing them a favour right now. AMD CPUs are hard to get right now and Intel seem to have reasonable availability. Even though AMD CPUs are most popular right now, many are compromising and going with Intel just because it's available. That's not exactly glamorous but it's clearly working for them.Driverless vehicles is already a busy market, plenty of competitors. It's hard to say who's going to be successful at this point, many of these companies will fail or get eaten up by others.",0,0.553,1.0,POSITIVE

Worth a little risk? If not, what your recommendations for Lidar or other self driving companies to invest in.",The one thing I never see commented about Intel is that Intel no longer wants to be a PC-centric company.. they want to be a data-centric company. I think a lot of people believe that Intel's innovation has stalled because they are losing ground in the PC game but I personally believe that Intel is just putting more effort towards gaining ground in the larger data-centric market. This could be a naive point of view but I think Intel's stock will correct once headlines start focusing more on developments/growth of the data business and people stop seeing them as a PC company (obviously this will take time).This change is a 1980s style shift in Intel's business. Last time it was shifting from memory to microprocessors which paid off for the company as a whole as Japan stole more and more of the memory market. This time it its a shift from PC to data... time will tell if it pays off but with Apple's M1 (soon M1x) performance and AMD closing the gap to Intel I feel they began that transition at the right point in time to stay relevant.,1,0.567,0.636,NEGATIVE
