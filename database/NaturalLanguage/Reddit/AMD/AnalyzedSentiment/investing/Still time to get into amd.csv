The company has done extremely well and its future prospects are even better... but if you just started investing, consider buying the SMH etf to buy the whole industry, then add an AMD position on top of that.

It often happens that people invest in well known and well liked brands, and then the stock is subsequently over-valued and prone to poor performance going forward for awhile.Most folks end up underperforming the market for reasons like this.

Thing is I didn't found a lot of resources to find this kind of information, most resources when looking around learn you how to read graphs, short trade combining shorts and idk what but that's absolutely not what I want and it's a bit the difficult part for me.

You are paying whoever owns the shares you are buying - supporting that person as it were. If you want to support AMD, keep buying their stuff. If you want to OWN AMD, then buy their stock. You would do this because you believe it is economically beneficial to you to do so.Just know that stock picking generally loses to buying the market. It's a tiny portion of S&P500 (for example) that drives most of the growth. The odds of you reliably picking winners to beat the index is really small. You can read about Warren Buffet's million dollar bet on this (he bet that the S&P would outperform active managers for 10 years, after accounting for fees, and he won the bet).None of this is to say you should not buy AMD. Just know the risks going in. Also recognize that by buying a US market index fund (S&P or total market) you are also buying AMD.",2,0.581,0.998,NEGATIVE

What's you guys taught?","If you really want to buy AMD, go for it! I'm not trying to talk you out of it. I would just want you to make sure you understand that there are certain risks with picking individual stocks, and in particular, picking companies just based on liking the products they make (or services they provide) is not necessarily a good investment strategy. People can bid the price of a stock up so high that growth in the price is not really possible anymore, at least for awhile. This is more likely to happen with popular companies that have had strong recent success. As long as you know that, and still feel good about it, it's fine.Personally, I don't invest in any individual stocks. But I do own AMD because it's part of the S&P 500, and I buy that. I also gamble a little bit on tech, and so I have a small position in FTEC, which is an ETF that tracks the information technology sector (so it has Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, AMD, etc). So I'm certainly not against tech stocks. I do keep the FTEC part of my portfolio to less than 5%, though. S&P is already pretty tech heavy (I think like 30% tech) as it is.As to P/E and stuff: No one here has a crystal ball that can tell you what is going to do well. If it were that easy, everyone would be rich.A high P/E just means you are paying more money for the stock relative to the earnings you are entitled to. The bigger question is: is the high P/E justified? A high P/E might be justified if future growth of the stock is likely to exceed expectations. I don't know the future, so I can't really say.I generally (95%) just buy broad low cost index funds (USA/international). I personally would keep gambles to less than 5% of the portfolio, but that's a personal call.",4,0.56,0.906,NEGATIVE
