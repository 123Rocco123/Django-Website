,"I have set up custodial accounts for my two kids and also my two nieces and put small amounts of money into the accounts for birthdays, Christmas and every two weeks. My wife and I have a full retirement portfolio and they all have 529 accounts being funded. These accounts hopefully will be starting out money for them when they turn 21 or possibly the start of their very own retirement accounts. Right now, they are invested in VTI, VUG, AMD (that was more speculation but it worked out!) and VIG and SCHD for a dividend end of things. My questions are as follows: should I be repositioning these funds at all? My two kids are 7 and 5 respectively and their accounts have yielded 16% and 14% currently and my nieces accounts (both 4 years old) have yielded 6%. I know these are good numbers and most would say why change if its working, but I’m trying to think down the line for tax purposes or if another type of investment platform would be right for them? I know I may not have given all the info needed for advice, so please let me know if any more info is needed. Thank you in advance!","I do the same thing for my nieces. I think your main concern is with taxes?I have them all invested with normal brokerage accounts and I pay the yearly capital gains taxes, and when they hit 18 I start to distribute then funds to them yearly. This would be considered a gift, and goes towards the lifetime tax free gift total. I want to say it is over $2M for every individual giver.I want to say you can gift $15k per person per year, but that might have increased.",0,0.532,0.855,POSITIVE

Thank you in advance!","Gotcha, since I have dividends reinvested and not actively selling, would this be the case for capital gaind each year? I kinda play the ignorant game with my accountant who handles everything. Also just starting out so I’m sure there is a level of insignificance here.Good to know about the gift rule, I’ll have to look more into that as well. Also want to look to see what options exist to roll it into a Roth for them if possible.",1,0.541,0.999,NEGATIVE

Thank you in advance!","With the way I do it only using a brokerage accounts, I pay all the taxes and you are correct with the DIV and capital gains. I have found it is not too much, and makes things easier. In that same vein I also get to tax loss harvest if something I bought them goes down and I need to sell.I only invest in individual stocks, so mistakes are made from time to time. And since the kiddos have at least an 18 year time horizon I take some minor risks for them.There is a chance to be put in a bad situation if something really blasts off. For instance I bought my son NVDA back in the day, and currently the gains for that holding would hit my taxes hard if I sold those shares, but I figure it is a good problem to have.I am hoping to hold out and then gift the shares to him outright while he has a low income, and try and look and see what happens if he were to sell them after holding them for a year.For a Roth my plan is to match my son when he has a job to bring in some income. So if he earns $5000 and then invests $1000 I would match his savings of $1000 into his Roth. He would just need to start earning income to get that started.",2,0.53,0.996,NEGATIVE

Sounds like a good plan to do that and I believe you can invest up to the earnings if I read correctly.",3,0.533,0.869,NEGATIVE
