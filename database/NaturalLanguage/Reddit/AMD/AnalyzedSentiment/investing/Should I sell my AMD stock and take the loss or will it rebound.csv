,I'm a novice investor and only have about 2500 invested. I bought some amd stock at 145 hoping it would go up a little before their earnings report and I could sell and make a couple hundred. Right now the stock is sitting at 136 and has lost 10% in the last two days. Would it be better for me to just take the couple hundred loss or should I just ride the wave?,"Stocks are not “get rich” easy scheme. If you could so easily invest into every stock right before the earnings and expect 10% gain every time this whole sub would be swimming in pools filled with cash. What you are describing is gambling. It’s not investing. I’m by no means an expert investor, but the way I see it you should just park your money in the market and leave it there for a minimum of 5 years and only sell if you absolutely need that money. It takes decades, but ultimately it should pay off. I’m sorry to be so blunt but this post really got to me for several reasons. Most of which I already described but also because AMD never does well after the earnings reports. So it’s really clear that you just dropped some money into a stock you probably know of because you are a gamer or are into computers and did not do any investigation on it. As I said. Put the money in the market and leave it there for the next several years at least. And most importantly continue to invest, diversify and read about investing. It’s already a good thing you start to invest, but investing will not make your life different in the short term or even in the medium term.",0,0.548,1.0,NEGATIVE

If you are in it long term, then the down swings are not so bad, and the up swings don't get you crazy excited. Just middle of the road, easy does it. In time, if you stick with it, you will come to understand this.There are only 3 things that you need to do to successfully invest:2a) Know what to buy.2b) Know when to buy it.2c) Know when to sell it.Now I know this sounds like a wise guy, but I am being serious here. If you think about this every time you buy a stock, you will get better and better as time goes buy. Very little attention is paid to the last point by most investors. When you are faced with a downturn, sometimes it is better to sell at a loss, take the money and invest into something else. Other times, it is better to wait out the downturn. There is no one size fits all answer for this situation, but the more you do it, the better you will get at making the right call.3) Analyze all your mistakes. Learn from them. You paid mightily for that education, don't let it go to waste.4) Learn as much as you can, and remember that you never stop learning. Get as many sources for market/economic info as you can, and soak them up every day/week/month/year. Education in investing is as important as the education you get for your work career. When I first started out, I struggled finding good sources of info. Over time, you will establish a BS filter/detector and be able to tune out the noise, and take in the nuggets. I will make one suggestion, not sure how others feel about this, but I find Blomberg TV to be invaluable. The experts they have on, are tops in their fields. They don't always get it right, but they are generally right, and generally not biased. I watch the recorded versions of ""Surveillance"" and ""The Open"" every night (to busy during the day when they are live, also I like to concentrate only on the show when I watch it, and I like to back-up and re-watch important segments). Note, you don't need a paid account to watch these videos, they are available on their phone app, or their website. CNBC is useful too, but they tend to be all about calling out stocks, while Bloomberg is more about discussing macro economic trends (which I find more important).Best of luck to you, and stick with your investing, don't get discouraged.",0,0.528,0.918,POSITIVE
