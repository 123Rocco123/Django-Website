,"I've been playing it safe in Googl, AMZN, plus lots of value stocks. Have some NVDA AMD AVGO but have been staying away bc crazy price increases. But with all these earnings revisions these could outperform the market for the next few years. Tempted to start buying more aggressively in the 'good' AI names and letting it ride over the long term. Thoughts?",Nvidia is like ~15% of vgt holdings. Just buy an index and long term hold. Youâ€™ll generally outperform. The tech indexes are already heavily weighted to AI,0,0.556,0.916,NEGATIVE

Tempted to start buying more aggressively in the 'good' AI names and letting it ride over the long term. Thoughts?","It all depends on if ai can be capitalized at any real level. The biggest difference is Cisco could keep up with the demand so when false narratives finally crashed so too did all demand and their issues. NVDA is behind demand significantly, allowing a possible shift to meet the working narratives instead of failing due to the failing ones. Itâ€™s not a risk Iâ€™ll take but that is the potential split right now.",5,0.519,0.539,POSITIVE
