,"The sentiment among both retail investors and institutional investors seems to be that growth is king. This is mostly fueled by the fact that companies such as Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, AMD, and Facebook have appreciated in value substantially faster than ""value"" stocks such as T, VZ, LUMN, KR. Investors see the returns growing companies provide, and project similar trends. If investing in Tesla provided a 10x return in a year, why invest in a boring stagnant company like AT&T that pays a 7% dividend and lost value? To me, this seems very reminiscent of 1999/2000, where fast growing tech companies were valued tremendously high. Much like now, the idea was earnings would keep growing, so these high valuations would be justified by high earnings in the future. Investors seem very much focused on ""investing in the companies of the future"" and thus prices have grown much faster than earnings have. One common misconception is that in 2000, the bubble was all unprofitable tech companies with no feasible business model, whereas today, growth companies like Tesla, Nvidia, and Microsoft are profitable. While companies with bad business models crashed the hardest, profitable tech companies were still overvalued in 2000 too. Cisco, for example, was profitable in 1999, yet it dropped in value by 75%, and still has not recovered from 2000 highs. Contrast that with a ""boring"" non-tech value company like Walmart, which barely budged during the tech bubble crash. Share appreciation is an important aspect of total returns, but share appreciation is entirely dependent on investor sentiment. Right now, enthusiasm for growth is at record highs. Investors are willing to buy unprofitable companies with the expectation they will grow rapidly and eventually become a profitable giant, and they can sell for more. It's important to ask yourself- what happens if this sentiment disappears as it did in 2000? Suppose investors suddenly decide paying over 60x annual revenue and over 600x EPS for a company like Shopify is no longer justified, and the price of such growth stocks drops 75%. Are you comfortable with that? In my opinion, growth is important, but the best way to value a stock fairly is to base it on the assumption that you can't sell it for 100 years, but any capital returned to shareholders can be reinvested either back into the company, or elsewhere using the discount rate you chose to discount value of distributions. When you do that, it takes swings in investor sentiment out of the question. You're no longer vulnerable to market volatility. The question becomes ""will this company provide a positive return given a discount rate on future cash flows?"" If the answer to that question is ""no"", then you're basing your entire investment on faith that the market will be continue to place a high valuation on growth and be willing to pay excessively for it. if that sentiment remains, great, you can profit. But if it doesn't, then you're stuck either holding the bag on an illiquid investment, or selling for a loss. It is my view that in the next decade, value stocks with low P/E ratios in less cyclical industries(ie consumer staples, telecommunications), will experience lower volatility than growth stocks with negative earnings or high P/E ratios, due to having consistent cash flows to back up valuations. I believe a handful of growth companies that do extraordinarily well will outperform a broad basket of value based companies, but the majority will not.","If you value over 100 years, that's ridiculous.
