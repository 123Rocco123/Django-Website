I'm looking at $AMD, but I'm not sure if I want to diversify to another x86 manufacturer, or NVDA. I do like AMD's earnings ratio a lot more than NVDA's. And i'm a strong believer in ARM processors (and own Softbank partially because of that), but it sounds like regulators might be pushing back against Nvidia's planned acquisition of ARM, so I don't want to buy that based on my appreciation for technology that they may or may not acquire.But back to the topic at hand, Intel may not be the trailblazer for the time being, but they do have the capital and resources to reclaim their crown. In the meantime, I'm happy to collect and reinvest dividends. My worry is that taking on new debt *could* conceivably put those divs at risk.

Now they're in decline because of many years of strategic failures, and it's culminated with what's happened in 2020: while AMD grew their data center revenue 93% and Nvidia grew their data center revenue 67%, Intel actually managed to lose data center revenue during a time when a chip shortage actually made it so people couldn't even buy their competitors stuff. There is no excuse for this failure and it will take many years to reverse.If you're looking for a value stock there is plenty of it in other sectors like banking. Skip Intel.",0,0.551,1.0,NEGATIVE

The thing was that intel fucked up their 14nm too, early and didn't learn. They try to shrink the node by a lot and increase transistor density by a lot at the same time. Compared by density intel 10nm is comparable to TSMC 1st gen 7nm.Now with that said, intel has fucked up on 14nm by jumping too hard into transistor density, same with 10nm. Furthermore, they were warned that 10nm is not an optimal size for a transistor.

CPU generations themselves often have very little changes. Major design changes like density though, those are always going to be significant.Intel fucking up 2-3 distinct design changes in a row isn't good.
