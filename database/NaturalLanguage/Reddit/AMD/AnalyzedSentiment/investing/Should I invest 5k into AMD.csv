It's at an all time high in a super whacky bull market. I know they're not going to see a massive decline, but just know that Intel has government backing and NVDA is seeing insane gains as well. AMD's currently working on hype more than product delivery. A lot yet to be seen, maybe you start with $1K and slowly up your position the more confident you feel.

But there's always a risk, even there. There's a chance Intel would turn around and reconquer their ground. But right now, AMDs market capitalization is about half of Intel's, so if you think AMD will take over Intel, it makes sense to buy.I think that Nvidia's business overlaps with Amd, but not so much that they can't both grow.",0,0.567,0.999,NEGATIVE

If good news on AMD GPU software or the GPUs are extremely competitive with NVidia's GPUs, I could see the stock easily going over 100$ this month.Console sales will be massive but I know investors have already priced that in.I think by the end of the year it will probably be 100$ or more per share. I've had 43c (expiry 6/18/2021) since april, but I really only expected it to hit about 70$ by the end of the year (until Intel kept fucking up).",0,0.594,1.0,NEGATIVE

I just feel like AMD is a company right now that is unstoppable in the computer world and seems to be playing off that way in stocks as well.","I am thinking about selling half of my remaining AMD (cost basis $30, long term gain) and putting it into Intel. I like AMD, but stock is rich, while Intel is dirt cheap. My main issue with AMD is not their product (at least on the CPU side), but their ability to build it in quantities to justify the growth rate implied in the stock price. They are over-reliant on the latest TSMC process nodes, which means they have to fight everyone else for allocation, including Intel, which very smartly bought up spare capacity at TSMC to both supply themselves and limit spare capacity available for AMD to expand share. And this is with Huawei freeing up a lot of capacity. What's going to happen down the road? It seems to me that AMD will have to take on a lot of risk by signing massive wafer supply agreements to get TSMC to invest in increasing fab capacity to meet the supply. But then what if product disappoints or market conditions are bad in a couple years, and they are stuck with all those wafers like they were with Global Foundries back in the bad old days? They pretty much have to nail the projections for market share 2 years out, and bet billions on those projections now. It's a risky moment for them.",0,0.56,1.0,NEGATIVE
