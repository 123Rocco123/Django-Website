,"Obviously no one knows, but it would be interesting to see what public opinion is for Nvidia's little brother. Do you think it can pass 200 in a year, or are we stuck to floating around 140-160? Nvidia is doing insane things on a daily basis, but idk if that will continue to positively affect AMD. Maybe it will cause AMD to drop if they can't keep up? Intel has a habit of never moving an inch, even with good news, so will AMD continue a similar pattern in the next year?",I don’t know but I am still buying AMD and INTC whenever they fall near/below my average cost.,0,0.56,0.895,POSITIVE

Wonderful success story of how savvy management bet on new chip architectures to take market share from Intel. Its Epyc CPUs are in high demand for cloud compute. Unlike Intel, which has floundered in the GPU segment, AMD has a GPU business that is accretive to earnings.Cons: Narrow moat. Competitive threats on both sides of the business: Epyc CPUs are seeing increasing threats from ARM-based datacenter processors. Microsoft is partnering with Lenovo, Samsung, and other OEMs to launch Qualcomm/ARM-based laptops. AMD is getting absolutely trounced by Nvidia in the GPU segment. AMD has taken leadership from Intel in many ways, but Nvidia is the final boss that AMD has yet to get past.I don't speculate. I just hold VTI and own my share of AMD, NVDA, INTL, etc. through a total market index. ymmv.",0,0.567,0.951,POSITIVE

They did get late into developing an ARM client chip about 10 years ago (actually a family of x86 and ARM chips for client devices to be used in a common socket) and they canceled it because of lack of customer interest. Rumor has it they're early in design for one ARM client product now and that would suggest customers are asking for it.Worth noting that AMD has a large interest in ARM products already as they are core to their Xilinx and Pensando products which AMD acquired, so they really do both.",1,0.574,0.871,NEGATIVE
