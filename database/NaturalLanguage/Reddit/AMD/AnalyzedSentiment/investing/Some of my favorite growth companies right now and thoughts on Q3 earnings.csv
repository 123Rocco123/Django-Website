,"Some exciting stuff this earnings season! Any opinions or thoughts on the companies below are appreciated. I have a number of other stocks i trade or hold but these are a handful of the companies I really believe in longterm with the exception of maybe snapchat. I just had to note that one due to the 22% sell-off we are seeing after hours... Netflix - reported solid numbers overall with eps coming in at 3.19, an 83% increase over the same period last year...they brought in 7.48 Bil in revenue and 1.45 Bil in net profits. They added 4.38 million new paid subscribers and expect that number to double next quarter, bringing the total count to 213.6 million. I believe the price action to the upside is justified and will continue. Tesla - best quarter yet for the ev car maker ! 13.76 Bil in revenue and 1.6 Bil in net profits. Gross profit margin increased to 26.6%. They delivered 241,300 vehicles and total production came in at 237,823. Numbers looking good and the price action/sentiment is very strong. Arkk base case for tesla shares is steep but starting to sound like a very possible reality. if the stock breaks above the previous all-time-highs of 900.40 we should see a decent move to the upside. I'm thinking 1k could come quick. SNAP - down 22% after hours on a fairly decent Q3 report...fwd p/e is a little high so it doesn't surprise me. Investors want a big beat on these growth companies sometimes and push the price down hard if eps doesn't come in much higher than expectations, especially if the stock has been performing so well. Shopify - earnings coming up next week on October 8th along with Amazon...growth is not appearing to slow up in 2021. Looks to me like they started ballooning as a company at the perfect time. They were well positioned to take advantage of the lock downs and have managed to maintain strong sales moving forward as things begin to open back up to some degree. I do not believe a full reopening of the economy would hurt the company at all. In fact it would likely be a driving factor for more growth and would help them sure up their position in the e-commerce sector. Nothing to report here yet for Q3 but i will be waiting. Coinbase - expected to report November 5th, seems well positioned from a TA perspective to really take advantage of what is likely to be another rally in the crypto space...
