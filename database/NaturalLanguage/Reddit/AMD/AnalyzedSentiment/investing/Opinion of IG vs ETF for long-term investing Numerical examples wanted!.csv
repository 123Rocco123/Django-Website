,"I'll try to keep this short. I (31M) am in Canada and have a steady job with a pension, own my house, no large debts (besides mortgage and car), and have 47K in cash that I've been sitting on for far too long. I have played with stocks in the past on Questrade and have basically only come out slightly positive because of investments in Apple and AMD. I was suggested a financial advisor and started talking with one at IG Wealth Management. Long story short: I'm getting cold feet at pulling the trigger with them. The portfolio they are suggesting is the iProfile Portfolio Global Equity Series F managed by Philip Petursson. Based on my aggressive investing stance, I'd be paying a 2.37% fee (MER of 1.01%). However this portfolio has nice returns after accounting for the fee (8.11 for 3YR, 28.01 for 1YR, 18.38 YTD). But doing some quick maths it looks like the fees would cost me $300K over 25 years in fees (if I'm investing 10-12k a year). This does not account for a waived or decreased fee once you hit $250k, which would be around year 11 for me. When I asked about these numbers they said that These funds are actively managed and you're paying for the available advice, as well as dampening losses in bad years, and overall a better return in the long run compared to index funds. They also said an expected growth per year is 7%. I was also cautioned that ETFs have hidden fees that are not shown upfront...which from what I have read, is not true. I know these advisors are salesmen that want to gain more clients. But I'm also aware that anyone can post their financial advice on reddit and act like it is the gospel while having no credentials to back it up. So my question is: What are people's experiences with IG vs ETFs and self investing? Would people be willing to share their experiences with either ETFs or IG and give numerical examples to back up their stance? Thanks!","Paying a 2.37% fee is like financial suicide. Absolutely not. IG is not a serious shop, either.Also: ""and overall a better return in the long run compared to index funds.""  Total horseshit. This fund has to beat the market by 2.37% every year for the next 34 years plus up to 30 years after that to your age 95.And that is to just march the market returns you could get for 0.03% fees.Don't be stupid.",0,0.556,NEGATIVE,1.0

Thanks!","I agree 2.37% is a lot, and is what made me pump the brakes with them. Truth is 300K ridiculous for advice, unless it's going to make me millions. But as a beginner to long term investing, I wanted to make sure that I wasn't underestimating the use of an Advisor.So, even ignoring fees, would an ETF like VEQT or XEQT be equal or better to the returns of IGI1902 portfolio?",1,0.516,NEGATIVE,0.881

Thanks!","If you want ""market"" returns, go for vxc which is world excluding Canada. VEQT or xeqt would be the one-fund solution I would take.Mer is 0.22% for those. Paying 2.1% more is just not a good idea.",2,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0
