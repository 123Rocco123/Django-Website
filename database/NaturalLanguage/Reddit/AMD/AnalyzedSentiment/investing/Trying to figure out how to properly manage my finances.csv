,"I [M28] have had a long journey investing and trading, and have lost a lot of money, and I’m now trying to do my very best to reallocate my funds. Here’s what I have at the moment: $12k in checking account $10k in 401k (haven’t been contributing but I am maxing it out this year and should have ~$28k by the end of the year) $20k in Roth IRA $103k in individual brokerage Much of my holdings have been in ARK ETFs (I know this was an awful decision, but I was young and made some poor choices). I’m wanting to exit those losing positions hopefully soon and sort out how else to allocate those funds. I will probably have the Roth IRA managed by my retirement company once I exit those positions so I don’t have to worry about it. I’ll also be getting quite the tax harvest from the selling the positions in my brokerage account. With all the losing positions I sell in my brokerage, I’ll have ~40k of cash to do whatever with. The other ~$63k is invested in TSLA, Google, Microsoft, Apple, AMD & AMZN. I have a $30k position in TSLA, so that’s most of it. I’m thinking about taking the $40k I get from my losses and putting it in a HYSA, but not sure that would be the best thing to do. I think it would certainly be much less stressful than investing over $100k myself, but I also don’t think I’ll need the money very soon. I’m single and currently live in Denver (I hate it here), and would love to be able to go to a warmer place, potentially San Diego if I can afford it. I don’t know much about buying a house nor do I feel confident enough in a city to buy one, so still renting for now. My rent is 2.3k here, and would be much higher in a place like SD. I’m hoping to get a decent raise soon that would be closer to $200k, but not sure if it’s gonna play out yet or not. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Please be gentle because I know ARK was a mistake and I’m trying to do the right things now. I’m trying to get out of the mindset of recovering my losses through investments, and would like to be able to live more peacefully and not check the market every day. Thank you!","Famous stock market investor Peter Lynch once wrote:How many times have you heard a friend or an acquaintance lament: “I’m a lousy investor in my house”? I’d bet it’s not often. Millions of real estate amateurs have invested brilliantly in their houses. There are sometimes families that must move quickly and are forced to sell at a loss, but it’s the rare individual who manages to lose money on a string of residences one after another, the way it routinely happens with stocks. It’s a rarer individual yet who gets wiped out on a house, waking up one morning to discover that the premises have declared bankruptcy or turned belly up, which is the sad fate of many equities.It’s no accident that people who are geniuses in their houses are idiots in their stocks. A house is entirely rigged in the homeowner’s favor. The banks let you acquire it for 20 percent down and in some cases less, giving you the remarkable power of leverage. (True, you can buy stocks with 50 percent cash down, which is known in the trade as “buying on margin,” but every time a stock bought on margin drops in price, you have to put up more cash. That doesn’t happen with a house. You never have to put up more cash if the market value goes down, even if the house is located in the depressed oil patch. The real estate agent never calls at midnight to announce: “You’ll have to come up with twenty thousand dollars by eleven A.M. tomorrow or else sell off two bedrooms,” which frequently happens to stockholders forced to sell their shares bought on margin. This is another great advantage to owning a house.)Because of leverage, if you buy a $100,000 house for 20 percent down and the value of the house increases by five percent a year, you are making a 25 percent return on your down payment, and the interest on the loan is tax-deductible. Do that well in the stock market and eventually you’d be worth more than Boone Pickens.As a bonus you get a federal tax deduction on the local real estate tax on the house, plus the house is a perfect hedge against inflation and a great place to hide out during a recession, not to mention the roof over your head. Then at the end, if you decide to cash in your house, you can roll the proceeds into a fancier house to avoid paying taxes on your profit.If I read this when I started working and put only the employer match to my 401(k) until I was able to buy my first home, then I would have been better off than I am now. This is despite the fact that I never planned to stay in one place for more than a few years (it's been six so far). And it's pretty much always been this way. IMO, ease off on other investments and buy that first home. Putting it in cash savings is the best way to save up for a purchase like this.The safest hiding place for those who don't think they can outsmart the market (and for most of those who think they can) is an index fund. Look into the three fund portfolio:https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolioThis puts the tailwind of everyone else's biweekly S&P 500 purchases in your favor. It's fully diversified and makes almost no trades so you can't be on the wrong side of a bet with another investor (and the vast majority are professionals). Even people who like to swing for the fences with a smaller amount of their money recommend putting most of it in this kind of fund.",0,0.53,0.783,POSITIVE

I was considering st Pete, FL (I’m from Miami), but the time zone is horrible for my job and the climbing gyms won’t be nearly as nice as the west coast or Colorado. Also all my friends are on the west side. Family is in Miami though",1,0.518,1.0,NEGATIVE
