,"First I want to say I'm a semiconductor permabull and this is 80% rant 20% question. Intel has shown time and time again that they won't get their heads out of the sand and admit defeat with their inferior node. Even with a new CEO, the same old mentality still persists with the company. Their atrocious guidance caused not only their stock, but the rest of the stocks in the semiconductor space to fall. I understand this is only temporary and the other semi stocks will go right back up. However, what bugs me is how this still happens even though it's obvious for over a year now that it's a problem internal to Intel and not an industry wide problem. I remember back in 2017/18 Intel's disastrous earnings always caused AMD to fall. Luckily it changed last year. I understand some investors see Intel as a money printing machine, but had they follow AMD for a past few years, they'd learn that most of the revenue were from deals Intel made way back when they forced AMD out of the space with monopolous policies. But that's besides the point. I'm curious what it would take for investors to stop associating Intel with successful semiconductor companies. Like IBM problems don't cause the rest of the tech industry to fall anymore does it? When will this happen in the semiconductor space? I have no position in Intel, but I'm long on countless other semiconductors stocks with my top five positions in AMD, NVDA, TSM, MU, and ASML. Sidenote: we're in the semiconductor supercycle so semiconductor stocks should vastly outperform general tech stocks this year.","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

I used to work for AMAT and Intel was our top tier customer that got whatever they wanted and other suppliers behaved the same. They will turn this portion of their business around as they still have a lot of the best talent and best practices engineering wise.,0,0.56,0.999,POSITIVE

When the first batch of speculative execution vulns came out, my impression as an engineer was ""Spectre is an embarrassing mistake but one anyone could have made just from not knowing that this was a channel that needed to be protected against. But Meltdown is the kind of cockup that should never have happened, and wouldn't if the people involved cared about building things right."" I think Intel has the same problem as Boeing, that they've grown complacent and lazy and lost the culture of excellence that made them a leader in the first place.
