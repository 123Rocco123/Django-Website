,"Hello, guys. I need your opinion. I am in my early 30s and I am planning on investing ~200k. I have just made Fidelity Roth IRA account and will be maxing out contributions there (prob 100% VTI) and planning on allocating rest of the funds. I know that portfolio will heavily depend on individual’s risk tolerance, but i was wondering if this break down makes sense in terms of risk management. I will be moving within 2~3 yrs so won’t be starting mortgage any time soon. Here’s my rough plan: 30% VOO 30% VTI -> ❗️suggested to VT 20% Fidelity SPAXX that has interest rate of ~4.97% (i assume this is default for cash sitting in Fidelity brokerage account, please correct me if i am wrong) -> ❗️suggested to be increased, maybe incorporate other HYSA/CD? 20% into actual stocks - im thinking about around 10-15 conpanies, candidates being tech companies like Nvidia, AMD, Amazon, Apple, Tesla and non-tech companies like Berkshire Hathaway (prob will need ~5 more good retail/nontech companies) -> ❗️suggested to be decreased, if not 0. My goal is to hopefully go aggressive enough for 10~15% gains per year and later, put half into mortgage downpayment. -> ❗️realistic annual return ~7% I would appreciate your comment and advice, any other potential investment recommendations would be great. Thanks!","Risk management is always hard to tackle because each person has their own definition of investment risk. If we define risk as the annual volatility of your portfolio, this portfolio doesn't achieve much in the sense of risk management.Starting with the 20% in individual stocks - I understand the allure of picking individual stocks and potentially seeing above average returns, but picking stocks has historically been a losers' game. In fact, 80% of active fund managers can't even beat the market and this is their field of expertise.The 30% in VTI and 30% in VOO is a much more sensible approach for the equities side of your asset allocation; however, VTI contains the entirety of VOO, so the two paired together are redundant. I would personally stick with VTI since it contains VOO plus mid and small cap US stocks.You are correct that SPAXX is the default cash option at Fidelity. It's a highly liquid money market account that most consider as a cash equivalent. I know the rate on SPAXX is currently very good, but those rates will not last forever and sitting on 20% cash is a lot of money left on the sideline.Finally, I would temper your expectations with market returns. 10-15% is too high of an expectation and you would be setting yourself up for failure if you went in to investing believing a consistent 10-15% return is achievable. A much more realistic expectation is a 7% return, or a 4% real return after inflation.Without knowing your timeframe for when you'd need the money for a down payment, I can't really recommend specific percentages for your asset allocation. If you plan on needing the money in 5-7 years or longer, I'd recommend a mix of VTI, VXUS, and BND to your comfort level. If you'll be needing the money in under 5 years, you may want to be much more cautious with the money since fluctuations in equities can take the better part of a decade to resolve.",0,0.521,1.0,NEGATIVE

Thanks!","Wow i did not know that 20% stock would typically be considered high proportion (in my 20s, i did 100% stocks and pull majority out with gains). It makes sense that a realistic expectation should be 7% return. Regarding BND, it seems like all the gains got wiped out due to high interest rate… (-10% since last 5 yrs). Would it be better for me to get some T-bills to lock in the gains in case something like this happens again? (Ive never purchased one before but i think you can get some through fidelity?)Given that I will pull half of my asset in 5 yrs, what proportions would be your recommendation?",1,0.521,1.0,NEGATIVE

Thanks!","I would put some international in there. The US might not continue to beat the rest of the world forever. I go for VT, which has a mix of US and international. You can also weigh it a bit more to the US, which is what I usually do.Honestly I wouldn't bother with only stocks, but that's just my personal preference. I like to take a more passive stance as individual stocks can be so unpredictable.",0,0.535,0.999,NEGATIVE

Thanks!","The opinion on how much individual stocks someone should hold varies a lot depending on who you would ask. Bogleheads will say you should hold no individual stocks, and that any are too risky. Others might say you can make your entire portfolio stocks if you're smart.In my opinion, I would avoid them altogether unless you have insider knowledge, or you know a lot about that industry.In addition, I would also go by your age. If you are young you can afford to have a slightly riskier portfolio. As you start to grow closer to retirement age, or the date at which you will pull out money, you should start to balance your portfolio to take up more bonds instead of stocks.In your early 30s, holding some bonds is nice for a bit of extra security, but I don't think it's absolutely necessary. A lot of it depends on your personal risk tolerance. If you do bonds, I would have about 10-20%.",2,0.518,1.0,NEGATIVE

Thanks!","You’re in your 30’s, so you have a lot of time to compound your investments. However I sense contradicting signals about your goals. You say you want to go aggressive but plan on doing a mortgage down-payment.These two goals, while very commendable are at odds with each other since I don’t think you plan to buy a house in your 60’s and you’re building a long term portfolio that’ll take years if not decades to provide meaningful and significant returns by compounding. Furthermore, that allocation might put you under your returns goal, I estimate about 7-8% pretax.So if we assume that you want to use half of the portfolio’s equity as down payment I suggest keeping the actual down payment in safer assets like in money markets and the rest on the allocation you have planned. That way you won’t be risking having to wait on a market reversal if it decides to be volatile on that particular year that you want to buy your house.Still, you might benefit from an advisor that could work around the particular fiscal and legal details. They cost money but I think they’re worth it in the long run. Reddit advice can be a bit crude or innaccurate due to the fact that we’re not privy to all the details of your financial situation. But still, hope this helps you somewhat to get a better idea of how to reach your goals.",0,0.525,0.899,POSITIVE
