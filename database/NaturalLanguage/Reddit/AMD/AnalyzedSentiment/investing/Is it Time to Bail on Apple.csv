In the worst case, you’ll keep what you were already planning on keeping but collect some premium along the way.Mine just got called away at 173 last Friday. I missed out on taking larger profit, but it could've been worse (like what's today) and I may have gotten greedy and not sold at 176 on Friday if it weren't called away.

AAPL fwd P/E of ~24 is on the low end of the Mag7, it has a shit load of cash to diversify its revenue stream should it choose to, and already has an AI “platform” with Siri which just needs some development attention.

I closed the position even though I'm not really that bearish on it - not like I think $0 is a possibility in my lifetime. But I'm pretty conservative in the portfolio, lots of dividends, REITS (I just retired 2024, wife is part time now). But AAPL was one of just a couple growth slots I had kept (in equities - equities are just 1/3 or so of NW, started for fun and it sure is!), but I'm not seeing the growth prospects as much going forward and there were some really good dividend and income plays at the time, so I closed the position in Aug 2022 (opened NOV 2012) at a 8.4x multiple. It does at least pay a dividend, but I wanted to repurpose that capital to earn more than the 0.56% AAPL pays now. It was also a TLH play, as earlier in the year I'd booked some big losses (LUMN, PARA, SCHP, MMM, ROKU) so the tax was $0.The taxed account now earns 4% dividend, the IRA equities 5.7%, so that's a good chunk of income for us. If/when we have to draw down, we have plenty in mutual funds to draw from, so this income should hold as long as the companies' dividends cooperate.",2,0.543,0.999,NEGATIVE

This is actually a more tax efficient capital distribution for individual investors given preferred tax treatment for capital gains.As for growth, within its existing categories, overall growth YoY was 2% but services was up 11% which has a higher margin (72.8%) than its products category. While not NVDA, this still has plenty of growth has left in the tank, especially as you think about other potential market penetration.GL in retirement, and if you like dividends, check out ARCC.",3,0.533,0.747,POSITIVE

Even before GenAI, their assistant was at least 10x worse than Google Assistant. They also made the dumb mistake to move the compute to on-device, which will prevent them from running any of the large / advanced GenAI models unless they rearchitect, and, due to the privacy-oriented stand that they took, have just a fraction of the customer data other big techs have. The latter means a lot more money will be spent buying and licensing training data.Besides, Apple's core competency is human interfaces and the integration of software and hardware. AI has nothing to do with that. They have a lot of cash and a bunch of software engineers, but, you know, so do a lot of tech companies. So even if they go ""all in on AI"", what makes you think they'll be able to pull it off and won't be another Apple Car-like project? Also, who in upper management has any deep knowledge in AI?

They make their own chips now, and they’re really, really good. After a 6 or so year slump it feels like they’ve managed to bring things back.Apple is yet to invest in proper cloud computing space for enterprises. That always seemed like a potential growth space to me, but they haven’t committed to it ever. They have all the pieces: their own set of languages and OSs, their own hardware, even their own cloud service offerings, but it remains untapped potential and probably will stay that way unless they want to push AI more. This space is the primary reason I invest heavily in Microsoft, because they understand the ecosystem they have and they continue to invest in its growth.Software and services seem to be doing well and growing. Seems like there is a new paid service offering every year. Not to mention they are getting more into banking services. I see this as the inevitable wealth extraction from their existing network, a void that their App Store and independent iOS developers used to fill. Apple TV+ is growing fwiw.iPhones and Apple Watches seem to be just reliable lines at this point and good revenue streams, but like you said now they are threatened by regional sales such as China and Russia. iPad hasn’t had growth in a long time.And future products seem kind of dead in the water. Apple Car is no more. We’ve all waited for the next killer Apple product for a long time and it doesn’t seem to be coming.Probably watch their next product line announcements and if it looks like another year of the same it’s time to roll them down IMO.

,"Was wondering what the sub thinks about holding AAPL at this point. I've had it since November, 2017 and it's up about 270% from when I bought it. At it's highest my gain was about 300%. It's down ~11% this year. It just seems a bit saturated. iPhone is getting shellacked in China. They've got a great ecosystem of products and loyal customer base with one of the strongest brands in the world, but it feels like growth is limited. Just wanted to see what everyone thinks. I know it's never a bad thing to sell and claim profits, but I know I'd kick myself if it did well later on. Also not sure where is a better place to park that money. I was thinking Netflix, it's been gangbusters recently, but the streaming market seems very iffy. I've got GOOG, NVDA, AMD, MA, V, MSFT, and META and not sure if I want to increase my exposure to any of those as well as they've done.

I took a lot of heat on this sub, but proven right so far.I’m waiting for the price to drop to a low 20’s P/E, then I’m a buyer.",0,0.535,1.0,NEGATIVE
