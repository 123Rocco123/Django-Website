,"Does anyone have any opinions on if this is a good investment? Given the recent AI boom everyone is focused on big players such as NVIDIA and AMD, but they are both supplied heavily by TSM for their chips. I don’t see much competition for TSM given they are so far advanced ahead of any American or Chinese competitor, and given the only increase in demand for AI technology, I don’t see how they wouldn’t grow. Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion. Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan. Trump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large. Any thoughts on TSM as an investment?",You’re just about 10 years late to the party.,0,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.969

Any thoughts on TSM as an investment?","My thought is that it's a 5.6% better investment now than when you asked earier this morning. Seriously though, everything you mention is common knowledge, thus already priced in. ""This is a good company because [whatever]"" is never a good reason to buy a stock, even if the [whatever] is completely valid, because everybody else knows how good it is too, so they've bought it and the price reflects that. It's ""priced for perfection."" If it does as expected, it stays stable or rises somewhat, depending largely on its size. (A huge $3 trillion company is not gonna grow at 40% as it did when it was a young hot puppy.) But there's always 100 ways to go wrong for every one way to go right, and if anything goes wrong, expect the price to drop. That's when you buy.",0,0.547,POSITIVE,0.804

Any thoughts on TSM as an investment?","Oh I'm the furthest thing from a pessimist. But the hottest, most profitable, most innovative, fastest growing chip company NVDA lost a huge 10% yesterday, making my point better than I could. Bad things happen to good companies. My point was just that deciding it's a good company, even a great one, should be the beginning, not the end, of a decision to buy it.In a theoretical perfect market where everything was always priced in and corrected for immediately and appropriately, nobody woud make any money. I think that's what they call the ""efficient market hypothesis."" Obv it never happens. We have different perspectives, forecasts, levels of information. Being human, we travel in herds, we overreact, we overestimate risks and underestimate rewards. etc.tldr: You can buy a good stock at a random time and hope it rises higher, but you do better if you do a little research and wait for a dip.",2,0.555,NEGATIVE,0.986

Nvdia valuation is high, but the company's financials are so good that it's still a good buy, and in this case you do not time the market, you just invest when you can and double down when stock dips.",2,0.601,NEGATIVE,0.799

The small amt the current admin is subsidizing to reshore is reportedly tough to staff as is. Most papers estimating the cost of disruption point to a recession on the magnitude of the 2007-2008 meltdown (with IMHO a serious socio-political readjustment after the economic shock).Longer term believe researchers are working on AI-robotic production of chips, but no idea when that will be scalable.",0,0.517,NEGATIVE,1.0
