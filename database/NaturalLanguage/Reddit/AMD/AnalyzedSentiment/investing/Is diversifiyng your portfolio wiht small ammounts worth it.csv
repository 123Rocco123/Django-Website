,"I am 33, and started investing a couple of years ago. I cannot afford to invest much, I spend 250-300€ a month on my investments. As I started I just bought a bunch of ""stuff"" since I didn't understand much (not like I do now). So anyways, I recently started diversifying my portfolio, sold the penny stocks I saw online that might ""blow"" and was left with couple of etfs, Nvidia, AMD S&P500. So I decided to allocate that monthly budged into savings plan, and my broker allows it without any fees. I left majority of my money in Nvidia and S&P. I then spent the remaining money on mix of mostly etfs. I diversified in sectors like tech, healthcare, real estate, energy, financials, communication services. Now I am worried, are those relatively small investments (10€ a month, or even 5€ for Global energy etf) gonna hurt my portfolio in long run? Could I end up investing in everything and later getting nothing, while I could have taken 5 ""good"" stocks or etfs and invest 50€ each and have better growth potential?",Diversifying does not hurt your portfolio. It improves it. But you should not need multiple ETFs for that. Just pump your money to a single boring ETF which invests to the whole world (including emerging markets). There are many available with sub 0.2% TER. I personally invest in SPDR MSCI ACWI IMI UCITS ETF (acc). The ticker in Xetra is SPYI. There are many other similar ones.Ie. I have an impression you are making this a bit too complicated.,0,0.513,NEGATIVE,0.998

You have iShares Core MSCI World and Vanguard FTSE All-World. The latter also covers emerging markets, the first one does not. Then you have a separate EM ETF: iShares MSCI EM SRI. So the Vanguard would suffice alone - unless you want the ""reduced fossil fuels"" stuff.And not sure if it is worth it to have SP500 ETfs. SP500 is already very much present in all world ETFs.

Actual diversity would be adding international ex-US or bonds or a different asset class. I’ll also add that your communications ETF most likely has a ton of overlap with your tech ETF.Everything you bought can be accomplished through the S&P 500. If this is a taxable brokerage account, don’t sell your sector ETFs (unless you just want to and/or are ok with taking a small tax hit); just start allocating everything in the future into S&P 500, and it will balance itself out.
