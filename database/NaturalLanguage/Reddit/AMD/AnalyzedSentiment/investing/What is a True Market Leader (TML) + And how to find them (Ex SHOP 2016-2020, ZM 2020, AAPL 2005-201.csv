Even though the stock corrected significantly, I think that a 50% correction was sort of unwarranted. Now, one can argue that Fastly was sitting at 78 before taking off just about a month ago. If Tiktok comes back, great! I would frankly want them gone so that the leadership understands the importance of diversifying clients--not putting their eggs in one basket, which is ironically similar to capital investment.Here is what I would want them to do----hire superstar Product Managers who talk to the customers and understand their (ever changing) requirements. Hire superstar Sales and marketing managers that can sell this premium products to enterprises. Do it for US, EU, LATAM, and Asia and replicate the success strategy.On the other hand, NET is loved by Reddit so much that I have felt that there are paid bots who write about NET. No doubt NET is a good company as well but I think that NET's C suite, predominantly the CEO Matt Prince just likes to fire cheap jibes at Fastly, which kind of shows that his only intention is to take down Fastly at all costs. For e.g., he downplayed compute@edge during earnings call and then yesterday, tweeted about a coworker posting an update that ""they would like to keep their competition on their toes"". Prince looks like an attention whoore who is overworking his people just so that his stock someday overtakes FSLY's. I would hate to work for that man.

Fastly is unlike Alteryx; the thesis remains intact fro Fastly. Also, know that management sand bagged the guidance for next quarter.I trust the management to execute at Fastly and I will give them 1 more year before I pull the capital out completely. I am convinced that they are capable of staying ahead of competition; they are an engineer driven company. What I want them to do is spend a lot of money in marketing and sales to make sure that they continue adding new customers.Also, folks who compare Fastly with NET--NET is suited for SMBs and their business model is cheaper and attractive. Therefore, rate of customer addition will always be higher for NET. In Fastly's case though, they get as much revenue from one enterprise customer as NET may get from 10 SMBs as an example.Lastly, I would wait to see the implications of compute@edge and whether it gains popularity among enterprise customers.

You want to see superior: Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters ROE >17% Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25% And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional. TMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments.

Dollar Volume > $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity. Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs. They should be: Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma) Volume and Price contractions within bases Up/Down Vol> 1.2 Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital. During corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages. They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling ""Buy me"". And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time. So how to scan for them: Use MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA.
