Transformer networks will be supplanted by something else in a year or two. In 2019, GANs were all the rage, and before that LTSTM, before that RNNs and CNNs…But the data (+access to insanely expensive compute resources) is what matters in the long term. Alphabet has few challengers on that.The catch is they seem to have fallen into the big company trap. Once you’re there, it’s extremely difficult to innovate again, despite all your resources.I’m not sure if Google will dig themselves out of this.

You're buying an existing business and all that entails along with all potential future r&d projects, including any related to ai. Personally, I tend to be fairly conservative as an investor and place a lot of weight on current business operations and stability and less weight on speculative future projects. That probably means I miss some homeruns. It also probably means I don't swing at a lot of bad pitches.If I had to pick between those 4 companies at current market levels, I'd probably go with MSFT, but none of them actually meet my own personal investment criteria, and even if one or more of them met that criteria in isolation, I still may not add it to my portfolio if it didn't make sense in the context of the portfolio as a whole.However, the criteria that I use for my investments is personal and based on my own circle of competence as well as my own goals for an investment portfolio. They're my goals, not yours or anyone else's. Don't make buy or sell decisions on this kind of information.

It's unlikely this will weaken, but there's also not much growth opportunity since they have already captured so much of the market. There's definitely geopolitical risk with this one given USA v China v Taiwan- AI model training is powered by GPUs. $NVDA is a leader in this space. A bet on $AMD would be that they start to be competitive in GPUs. However $AMD still has a lot of upside in the webserver market. They are taking tons of market away from Intel in terms of data center. The consumer aspect of both of these companies are not parts to be excited for.- $AAPL is way behind the other tech giants in AI. Have you used Siri recently? It's still garbage. $MSFT and $GOOGL have huge advantages in here in terms of AI research, model training capabilities (data center processing size) and also ability to capitalize on AI (cloud, search)",0,0.552,1.0,NEGATIVE
