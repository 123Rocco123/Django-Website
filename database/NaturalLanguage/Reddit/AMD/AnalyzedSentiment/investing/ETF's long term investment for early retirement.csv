,"Hi! We're both 30 and are looking at what to invest in to start an early retirement account and a safe 15-20 year investment for a child. We already max out 401k and IRA so now looking at taxable brokerage for retirement at 3k monthly contribution. We have a child due this year that we'd like to start at 500/monthly contribution as an idea they can use this for a down-payment. We will also be starting a college fund. We have some riskier investments from college that have done well and we haven't touched so I'm looking for both of these to be more stable. We have about 70k in variable tech like AMD, AAPL, NVDA, OLED etc. Some people have recommended slowly moving this into other funds- we have held for more than a year. But I'm not sure that'd be worth the capital gains to do vs just sell when we want the money out? For long term we have about 20k in SCHB but my plan is to do the following for early retirement: 70% SCHB 20% SCHF 5% SCHC 5% SCHE For child I have no idea so I'd appreciate some help in that one. Thank you! EDITED To add: Brokerage is through Schwab. I think I can also buy vanguard there with no fees but they seemed to preform similarly so I was planning to stick with just schwab based. If i am wrong on this please let me know!",We have a child due this year that we'd like to start at 500/monthly contribution as an idea they can use this for a down-payment. We will also be starting a college fund.If you can Maintain and really put $500 per month - every month until your kid graduates from college - That should be $220K or more when they are 22. That would be the best present ever for a parent to give their kid that much of a head start on financial independence and home ownership.,0,0.537,0.971,NEGATIVE

If i am wrong on this please let me know!",We can afford to do that. I've already set aside money for the first few years I just want to dollar cost average it in.I've made the 3k to early retirement and 500 to child account as lower end amounts. We hope to up them but know we can do that for a long period of time.Do you have any recommendation on stocks to put it in? That's where I am kind of at a pause :(,1,0.531,0.999,NEGATIVE

Let them start with known success stories. QQQ VOO + VTI are going to double every 5 to 7 years unless some really crazy shit happens.,4,0.51,0.702,POSITIVE
