For index funds, the probability of a 100% gain > probability of a 50% loss.Otherwise, the expected value would always be less than the asset’s price, which would imply negative returns.Example: if we have normally distributed returns, then 50% loss has the same probability as 50% gain. Then starting with a stock price of $100, the price would follow the sequence $150, $75, $112.50, $56.25, $84.375, …, eventually $0.

Ty","Buffett doesn’t provide specifics with respect to his general rule because it’s a general rule, applicable to different investment strategies.If one wishes to pursue individual stocks, as Buffett has, then the rule “never lose money” has certain requirements: At a minimum, you must commit to developing a deep understanding of any business in which you invest your money. This is done by reading the quarterly and annual reports of not only your target company but also its competitors and likely its suppliers and perhaps, if it’s a B2B, its customers. To understand these reports you need to have a firm grasp of basic accounting principles and be able to read a balance sheet and a cash flow statement. Ultimately, you need to invest the immense amount of time and intellectual attention that Buffett himself has devoted to the task, if you hope not to lose money.Alternatively, if one wishes to pursue an index fund strategy, as Buffett recommends for the vast majority of investors, then the time and resource commitment to learn about all these companies is greatly reduced if not eliminated, and the primary factor for never losing money is psychological discipline. Knowing that the market as a whole always goes up in the long run, over periods of 10+ years, one must not give in to short term fears when an index fund declines, lest the investor turn an unrealized loss into a realized one, and thus lose money.Morgan Housel has excellent discussions of both Buffett and index investing in his wonderful book, The Psychology of Money.",0,0.527,POSITIVE,0.961

Ty","The point he's making is twofold.One is, don't do anything that risks taking you out of the game early or entirely. One of Warren's early business partners used leverage and then got bought out by Warren and Charlie from Berkshire, to save him. His stake in Berkshire if he still held it would be worth billions of dollars, but because he was levered up he did something that irrevocably broke the chain of his ability to compound his wealth. He's still wealthy, but not a billionaire.The other is take asymmetric bets. Low downside high upside. Warren doesn't try to take bets that require consistently perfect execution on the part of the company to work out, he's trying to buy companies with big margins of safety that have such great economics that inept management could still generate a good return with the company.He doesn't wander around saying just 'don't lose money'.

Ty","It's not as simple as the analogies you use.Of course at first it seems non sensical that someone has to tell you to not lose money, why would you want to, it seems dumb.But the reality is that humans will do things that don't make sense when they are being driven by emotions and irrational thoughts. Let's say tesla has been doing well and all your friends tell you you should invest into them. You at first only hear a couple saying it so you ignore it, but then you see the stock sky rocket 10% in a couple days. Now you want in before it's too late (rather than researching on the company as well as its current state and dealings, as refuse to wait and observe) . So you buy $3000 in tesla. Oh guess what, you didn't do any research and suddenly you find yourself in a situation where tesla has crashed 25% over the next 2 weeks. You get sick of it and sell your stocks before you lose more. Worse yet, they rise 30% of the next month, and you want to pull your hair out.In this situation you bought high and sold low. Now from an outsider viewpoint this seems dumb, like how could someone misjudge the investment so badly. Sadly this isn't uncommon and it happens often, especially to new investors. They get scared or overly excited and make rash decisions, not based on logic or a plan, but based on whims and opinion. ALWAYS RESEARCH WHAT YOU'RE INVESTING INTO, I don't care if it's an etf or ""passive"" it doesn't matter. You are still buying into companies with ETFs so you should do research into the top allocated ones, and at least research from a macro level.This is an example of what Warren Buffet means. That quote you said is grossly simplified but he has explained it many times in his conferences and q&a's.Again it seems non sense but it's actually really good advice. Don't make investment decisions with your hard earned cash based on opinion, bias, hype or panic. It will cause nothing but issues and rarely comes out well.

Ty","Start with researching Mr. Market who is a creation of Benjamin Graham, Buffett's mentor.Then ask yourself why exactly did you pay the price you paid the last time you bought a stock? Btw, this quote doesn't apply to ETFs or Funds.It's specifically about how one can evaluate a company to find its intrinsic value (aka, the value of future cash flows discounted back to the present) plus a Margin of Safety and compare that value to the price crazy Mr. Market is offering you to purchase it.When you assess the true value of future cash flows and factor in a hefty margin of safety, say 30-40%, you arrive at a value that tells you what price you can buy at and be safeguarded from losing money.Well, safe if you also have the temperament to ignore Mr. Market and not sell to him when you feel badly, and to know that day to day swings are noise and you shouldn't need to look at price for at least a year because that's how long you'll be holding while you let the market correct its mispricings and earn you a return on your capital.These are pillars of value investing and be sure to note that Buffet is a very specific type of investor and doesn't mess with high growth tech stocks. He doesn't diversify. He knows banks, insurance, infrastructure, energy and candy/soft drinks.Forgot to mention that his follow up to that quote is if you don't have the time to put in the absurd amount of work it takes to evaluate companies or the patience to buy assets with 5-10 year time horizons, he says you're way way better off just DCAing into a low cost S&P500 fund and you'll do just fine. This is correct.It takes zero effort, it has never lost money over a long enough time frame (~15-20 y), and will earn you 9-10% CAGR with reinvested dividends. And diving into the whole stock picking thing takes so much time and you'd be lucky to get 12% CAGR.
