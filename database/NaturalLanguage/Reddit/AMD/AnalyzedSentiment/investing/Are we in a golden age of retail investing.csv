I mean technically it may defined as one but bear markets happen for a reason and structurally important things happen during them. Usually, when stocks are high before a crash, there is a lot of investment in the economy into different sectors. Some areas attract a lot of capital due to hype. During a bear market, lots of things happen. The first and obvious one is that stocks go down. Stocks go down because there are is the expectation of layoffs and bankruptcies. These layoffs and bankruptcies allow investment and labor to be re-allocated to other parts of the economy. It doesn't feel like these structural changes haven't really happened yet. It feels like we just propped up the old cycle as opposed to starting a new one.Maybe all cycles work like this, maybe they don't.
