They restructured their leadership so that the talent went to the Ford brand proper instead of off-shoots like Jaguar, and in 2009 looked like they had a solid plan to get better.However, since then Ford has been unable to consistently produce quality sedans and SUVs compared to its competitors. It more often than not loses the budget market to Kia, loses the high-end market to Japanese and German companies, and loses the American market to Chevy. The once iconic Mustang is completely bland and underperforms other sports cars.The only thing Ford has going for it is the F-150.

Thoughts?","I just bought a few more shares of Google myself, but for the sake of diversity I do buy into other things.Pepsi has treated me well recently, I've picked up a few energy stocks that do well, but most of what I have are buy and hold.We know that time in beats timing, and realistically the stock market is currently in a struggling downward trend. I doubt any of us can predict the bottom, but predicting a company value that the stock reasonably will return to is slightly easier in my opinion. So there's two schools of thought:First- any positive gain is goodSecond- Positive gain is only good if you're beating stock market gains. If nasdaq goes up say 5% and your stock of choice goes up 3, you should have invested in the nasdaq.So the question becomes, will your stock beat the market? If you don't think so nab a ETF. If you do think so, or don't care, nab what you want. I sit in that yes/don't care boat. How do I assess those? Outside my usual financial dive I look at the trend between market decline and the stocks decline, compare it to the fiancials and news, then see if the decline is warranted in my opinion or not.As an example, Google lost 3% off its AI mishap, I'm not convinced that is a meaningful loss and they could male that up. Google has other problems justifying a lower stock price, but their ai venture, IMO, isn't one.So circling back to what would I do? I just got back and screen and find things I like, if I can't I pick up ETF's.",4,0.559,0.73,NEGATIVE
