,"I'm currently interested in opening up a small position in Intel. However, it is a highly debated stock and I would like to hear corresponding arguments coming from Bull and Bear. Intel currently has a revenue of $80 billion which is bigger than Nvidia and AMD combined. The delays in production of newly advanced nodes is beginning to hurt Intel. Intel currently announced a new CEO to change the management around and hopefully get things back onto track. This , however, will take several quarter if not longer to implement. But Intel still has growth story in it's' datacenter and MobileEye division. What do you think of Intel as a turn around play?","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

People are looking at what intel is going to have to offer compared to amd and nvidia 5 years from now, not what next q eps is. If anything throw some extra money in amd to hedge and feel bad in a year when you didnâ€™t listen and just go full amd",0,0.592,1.0,NEGATIVE

It literally is the most advanced North American foundry. It's behind TSMC right now, but it has the capital to fund the R&D to become competitive. That said, this takes time. Years. And in that time TSMC & Samsung will similarly be moving forward. That said, it is geopolitically important to the US to remain at the forefronts of innovation in the semi-conductor space. It is possible that Intel could get government backing, which obviously would speed up the process (this is based on absolutely nothing solid, just a leap in logic). But at the same time for this to happen, Intel's foundry side would likely have to be spun off, which I personally think would be a good idea.Here's the bear case. AMD is eating Intel's lunch. Their stock price will reflect this. And they likely won't have a serious response to this until 2023 based on their most recent earnings call. Apple similarly will likely eat into both AMD and Intel market segments. The release of their M1 chip is what I'd consider a serious game changer and the idea of ARM based laptops means we've got a new challenger in the space. Nvidia similarly is going to encroach even more on Intel's server dominance among the numerous startups who build specialty chips that cater to the server space. So Intel is doubly losing on the enterprise front, the hedt front, and the consumer laptop space.Personally, I'd wait and see how the new CEO performs before opening a position on Intel. But I'm pretty confident that Intel is still a good buy, it's just not as good a buy compared to other companies in the semi-conductor space.That's just my 2 cents, hope it helps!",0,0.556,0.997,NEGATIVE

What do you think of Intel as a turn around play?","They've lost any future sales to Apple (and Apple didn't buy the cheap chips).They're going to lose more and more of their chip sales to Amazon (Amazon definitely didn't buy the cheap chips).Who knows what the status of Google and MSFT moving their clouds to semi-custom ARM chips is... I would bet GOOG is mostly shifted for in-house work already, but just hasn't told anyone.This is a HUGE headwind IMHO.People often don't realize that Intel's margins on top-end chips is extremely high, and the margins on the cheap chips is next to nothing (but helps pay off fixed costs, R&D, etc). Server chips are in the multiple thousands of dollars each, and budget desktop chips like $50. Buyers know this, and hate this. But Apple didn't have the scale to go in-house 10 years ago, neither did the cloud guys. They do now.What's the next hit? Could MSFT, SAP, Oracle or even Adobe and AutoCAD bundle in-house semi-custom ARM based hardware with their on premises software? I think so.I've been debating going somehow negative on Intel for some time now.",0,0.528,0.995,NEGATIVE

What do you think of Intel as a turn around play?","The bull case for Intel is that, as an IDM, they benefit from the global chip shortage. TSMC is raising prices as everyone clamors for their fab space, which obviously impacts profit margins for their customers. On the other hand, Intel ""sells"" chips to itself at cost, so they enjoy a built-in price advantage. As chip demand continues to outpace supply, that advantage will grow. If you buy this argument you should also be bullish on TSMC and Samsung.The bear case is that INTC will be perpetually undervalued because Wall Street is fundamentally skeptical of their business model. Wall Street views non-Asian manufacturing as inherently inefficient, hence their persistent desire for Intel to spin off its fabs.",0,0.537,0.997,NEGATIVE
