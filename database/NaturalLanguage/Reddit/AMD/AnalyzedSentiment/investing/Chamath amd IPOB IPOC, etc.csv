,"Ia anyone investing in Chamath‘s Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. IPOA, IPOB and IPOC? From the site: Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings is a partnership between Chamath Palihapitiya, the founder and current Managing Partner of Social Capital, and Ian Osborne, a co-founder and the current CEO of Hedosophia. Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings unites technologists, entrepreneurs and technology-oriented investors around a shared vision of identifying and investing in innovative and agile technology companies. We believe the future success of the capital markets for technology companies is dependent on new company formation, the sustainability of robust private market funding and an increased willingness of private technology companies to become publicly-traded and therefore become available to a broader universe of investors who can benefit from their disruption and growth. Our mission is to create an alternative path to a traditional IPO for disruptive and agile technology companies to achieve their long-term objectives and overcome key deterrents to becoming public.","Had tiny bit of IPOB, sold after Opendoor announcement has had no interest in it (and I don't think that was the kind of company that a lot of IPOB shareholders hoped would come out of it.) Have tiny bit of IPOC, will see what the chosen company is (given the announcement of IPOD, E and F, I'm guessing we find out C company sooner than later) and we'll see how it goes.This whole SPAC thing is getting more than a little ridiculous, but I'll play along with a little bit here, a little bit there and there's been a couple of companies that have come out of all this that I find very interesting (Desktop Metal - TRNE) where I have a small position and will see where things go.",0,0.55,1.0,NEGATIVE

I'm sure he'll come up with something else, but he failed to get his first choice.I also find SPAC's ridiculous. The price is relatively capped on the downside at $10 (or $20 for PTSH) up until merger, and the more attractive/memeable ones can rocket upwards 300-500% even without revenue or viable prototype (NKLA).Oh and thanks for the short-lived post you made about SBE. Got a small position in that as well.",1,0.525,1.0,NEGATIVE

I think the funny thing is that I don't know that Air B/B is something that I actually want to own; I've tried to think more about travel lately and whether there are ways to get exposure to travel in a somewhat more stable/consistent/long-term manner that interests me (nothing yet), but if he came out the other day and announced that Air B/B was the choice I'd probably have sold PTSH.""I also find SPAC's ridiculous. ""Chamath the other day said that he had already reserved IPOD through IPOZ. It's one thing to do a few SPACs, it's another to turn them into a production line and at that point it's easy to think that it's not about finding the best things to bring public via this vehicle, it's about benefiting from bringing as many things as possible public via SPACs. If Chamath is potentially doing a SPAC for every letter of the alphabet and there's what feels like half a dozen other SPAC IPOs every week, you're going to quickly run out of quality potential companies to bring public. If NKLA really is less than advertised or other problematic companies start getting brought public via this method, then you're going to see people sour real quick, but until then...I dunno. My view on SPACs is very small tracking positions in SPACs where I think there's some potential and if the company being bought is of interest, great if not then instantly move on. For all the SPACs that have been announced, there really haven't been that many companies that have come out of this that I'm interested in owning, at least yet.",2,0.529,1.0,NEGATIVE

LFAC is an interesting one I need to read more about - I generally like homebuilders for the long-run, but I wish LFAC were focused a little more on the luxury market and less CA-reliant. Not actionable now, but DKNG was certainly another good one at the beginning of this SPAC-wave.What will also be interesting to watch play out is if all these companies that are rushing into the public markets will be able to handle the burden of being a public company and all of the compliance and reporting requirements that entails. I haven't come up with a name that inordinately benefits off this other than the already large professional services firms.",3,0.544,0.914,NEGATIVE
