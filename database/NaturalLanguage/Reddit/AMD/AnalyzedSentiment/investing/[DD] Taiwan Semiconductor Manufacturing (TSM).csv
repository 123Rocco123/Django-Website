Joe Biden has laid out a $50B subsidy plan for research and development in the semiconductor industry.

The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn‚Äôt pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden‚Äôs $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies.

Conclusion The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM‚Äôs Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn‚Äôt pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden‚Äôs $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years. **This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

Does it not seem more plausible that it is strategy? It‚Äôs been known since the 70‚Äôs that the costs of scaling would skyrocket after 7nm where EUV becomes necessary. EUV is not a secret technology, it‚Äôs just super expensive and a big jump. Intel sells every chip they can make in their own factories where the likes of AMD farm out their chips at a 30% premium in a time where ROI is getting tighter by leaps and bounds. It hasnt been that long since the European Commission fined Intel over a billion for abusing its dominant position and AMD was near bankruptcy. Intel didn‚Äôt just forget how to make chips. They made more money off their 14nm process then any other process. A CPU also has a lot more performance factors to it than just simple gate size, there is a lot of clever engineering like tri-gates that squeeze out more performance out having to resort to EUV. Does the average consumer really care about the slimmest margins of power consumption and gate size, no they care about price. There are a lot more average consumers than gamers. I see this as a strategy to squeeze every dime out of traditional litho before making the plunge into EUV.",1,0.531,1.0,NEGATIVE

The cost of a new car is absurdly expensive and maxes out your budget. But your car still gets the job done and you can put a lot in savings. Your neighbor got drunk and wrecked his car and doesn‚Äôt have insurance so he has to lease a brand new one. He certainly looks cool in his new car to all the kids that don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs a lease but he paying a premium to drive it while you are saving money so you can pay cash for a new one when you need to.

Intel, Samsung and TSMCTSMC have over 50% of the market share in the foundry business. its eco system is second to none.for high end node, you needs ASML EUV machine. However, having EUV does not guarantee you, profitable yield. you need to develop your craft(process) that will make you money. Intel struggle with 10nm for so long and 7nm is delayed is the testament to that. TSMC's process is already 5nm production and 3nm in risk production.TSMC raise its capex year over year and TSMC is a very conservative company. that mean they anticipate their business growth and we can see why.TSMC capex is telling us. the market no longer waiting on Intel or merchant chip companies like Qualcomm. Apple M1, AWS Graviton, Youtube's video-transcoding chip, Google Tensor for pixel 6...etc.i believe there will be more and more company develop its own chip and outsourced to foundry. either make their product stand out from everyone else using off the shelf chip or fix a bottleneck that common chip can't.",0,0.562,0.964,NEGATIVE

The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn‚Äôt pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden‚Äôs $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies.
