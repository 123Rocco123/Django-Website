CRWD is getting smashed right now but has big upside potential in future years.I am older than you, and I diversify by holding ETFs more than stocks. I have a lot of stocks, too, including some of the ones you hold: CMG, TGT, DIS, CIBR (ETF), BRKB. I almost bought ABNB recently but ran out of cheese. I have XHB instead of RH because it also holds WSM, FND, etc in addition to RH and of course home builders. It’s down.The bulk of my portfolio is VTI, SCHD, BRKB, and VTV. That has taken less of a hit - especially the non-VTI holdings - than my AMZN, GOOG, GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, etc stocks and way less than my hopes and dreams holdings.I opened a separate brokerage account for my long term future plays and keep it to < 10% of my portfolio. That’s where I hold my ETFs and stocks for EVs, fintech/crypto, cyber, cloud, space, and alternative energy. In there I have BATT, CIBR, SI, GFOF, RKLB, TSLA, WCLD and so forth. It’s of course down by a bigger percentage than my other, safer accounts. In those I also hold consumer staples like FSTA, COST, WMT as defensive plays.",2,0.518,0.634,POSITIVE

Thank you","Go to through each of those tickers and zoom the chart out five years. If there was a massive increase in price in the past few years then a significant recent decline (i.e. starting around this January), there's a good chance the stock became massively overvalued and is currently dumping to whatever the price was before the accelerated growth.. or worse, depending on the company's recent performance or governmental fuckery (Chinese stocks specifically). If you're in a position to take profits or breakeven on those tickers, I would REALLY recommend you consider doing so.Companies that are technically doing well like Apple, FB, AMD, Tesla, etc. I wouldn't worry too much if your average prices aren't near all-time highs.

Based on my holding shared, and I believe those stocks have ground to make up, how else will you protect or grow portfolio? Thank you","First congratulations on transforming 50K to 500K. I know the drop from 1M was painful, but I'm sure you had a few options trades that went against you. SO the key is to look at things now, the past is the past and we can learn from it, but not undo it. Just as I'm sure you learned a couple things the hard way with options this is a learning experience with stocks.Your portfolio is concentrated in growth stocks, these will get slaughtered in a bear market. The start of the drop in QQQ was Nov 2021. The broader market peaked Jan 2022. BRKB is diversivied and has been holding up well, better than the total market. All the rest needs better diversification.My expectation is that we are in a bear market and SPY will drop to at least 300 possibly lower. I know the nasdaq has been hurt and it may continue to outperform on the downside compared to the rest of the market. So where do you go from here?Many people have the conventual wisdom to buy and hold long term, but you bought tech at the peak. If I am correct that we have more downside then you should immediatly quickly move all other stocks to something diversified like SPY. I am not in the buy and hold camp and moved to cash in late Jan after an 8% drop. The market has dropped further since. You could move to cash and put a buy stop limit order in place to re-enter the market so it doesn't leave you behind after the bear is done, or try to re-enter at a lower value after sitting cash for while.I have been trading the SPY based on the value of the VIX. Currently VIX 35 has been good entry points for long positions. With an exit at VIX 20-25 (or even 28 if conservative). My accounts that I can trade I have recoved my Jan loss and gone positive. In my 401k that is limited to mutual funds, I have not been able to make up all the loss, but some short term buys in energy helped (FSENX). For an equivilent ETF I like VDE, but the easy money in that has been made already. Mainly I am holding cash with some ocational day / swing trades if an opportunity presents itself.Since you have experience with options you could set 50k aside for options trading with an understanding the market has a downside bias. If you lose that, don't go back to the rest of your nestegg to refill. It could be the volitility is high enough that this becomes dificult with the premiums needed. This is obviously a different market than when you traded options. Trading stocks avoids the premium drag, but it does not have the dramatic upside potential. If you got to the 1M on a single YOLO instead of a series of consistent good options trades, then I would not recomend further trading in the options. You were right to step away from the table with your winnings. Don't know if you were trading at robinhood, but for your stocks I would move to a better broker like Fidelity.I don't like bonds in a rising intrest rate environment. I believe the QT and increase in fed funds will deflate what I think is a current stock and house bubble by causing a recession. This will drop earnings on the SP500 and cause further reductions in stock price to get the P/E reasonable for what future intrest rates will be. Cash is not ideal either as it looses 8+% to inflation, but I don't have any better low risk ideas. I still like the energy sector, but just as a rising tide floats all boats, a sinking market will be a drag on all sectors.Fidelity has a nice brochure on there sector funds that describes the business cycle and what sectors tend to do well when. This type of information is useful in thinking about when it would be a good idea to re-enter tech. And when you do I would want to be more diversified. I have heard a good rule is no more than 4% in any single stock. So for tech, when the time is right, you could buy QQQ and if you want more semi exposure SOXX. I like AMD as a company, I'm not shure I would want to just hold AMD for semi exposure.Hope this helps and good luck!Edit: FYI about me, I'm 50 and was in stocks before the 2000 crash, so I have seen both the 2000 and 2008 crash. The curent volitility remides me of those markets. I trade a 7 figure portfolio.",0,0.539,0.996,NEGATIVE

Thank you","The Brochure at Fidelity:https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/investing-sector-guide.pdfI would say we are in what they call the ""late"" section of the business cycle, before recession. That gives you an idea that growth and IT stocks are not a good choice now and won't be until things recover a bit after the recession.I typically don't focus on sectors too much I like broader diversification like the Sp500 (SPY, VOO) or total market (ITOT, VTI). I'm typically not good enough to know what sector will outperform and I get frustrated if I underperform the overall market.In looking at your stock holdings I'm guessing you had some options losses since Nov. It is a bit hard to see losing over 50% with just those stocks. Do you have an exit plan for your tesla and apple options? I don't trade options, so I don't know if you can set exit orders. But, you should decide what stock price you are looking for to exit those trades. I like to set an alert on my phone so I don't need to watch all the time.I really don't like specific stock risk. You never know when the CEO is going to decide to buy twitter and drop stock price 12% in stock sales to make that happen. Or a slight miss on earnings blows up the price.A good honest look at your trading since Nov is in order. You mentioned you don't know how you got here, you should look at exactly how you did get here. Figure out profit and loss for each investment. If the options have been worse than the stocks then I would say you should stop that. Your current options are calls in a sector that has been dropping for 6 months, so you are betting against further drops in a declining market. If you traded puts at least that would provide a hedge against your stock holdings.As far as my near term thoughts on the market, we are in a trading range between 405-430 on the SPY, currently at 411. The 52 week low is at 404, and that will drop off next week as it was a year ago next week. So we will start making 52 week lows on the SP500 in addition to the total market and Nasdaq that have been doing that for a while. I don't know if this will impact investor psychology, but it can't help. If the CPI is bad I could see us breaking the resistance at 405 with potential short-term down to 380. For the upside I could see us returning to 430 and maybe 440 if inflation drops (remember 1 month at less growth dosen't mean inflation is fixed). With the issues of avian flu and the mass killing of chicken I think food inflation is going up. I also don't think the higher price of fertilizer has been priced into food yet. The CPI number is a 1-2 day impact, you need to be thinking long term like 1-2 years. Is infaltion going to magically evaporate after the 50bps hike and get a soft landing. I don't know if you listened to Powel in the press conference, he chuckled when he said he was aiming for a soft landing, he knows that won't happen.But what you are doing now by re-assesing your situation and seeking some help is the right thing to do!",2,0.55,0.999,NEGATIVE
