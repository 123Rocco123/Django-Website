,"Starting a new portfolio as my old one is at $325k with $265k cost basis and want to stay under the SIPC limit. Thinking about taking large positions in these 3 companies. What does everyone see as the future outlook? Obviously you have your Google, Amazon, MSFT, NVDA, amd, Avgo positions to any portfolio but I feel these 3 can really break out. Curious to know what you guys think. Thanks!",SIPC limits are mostly relevant for cash. The securities themselves (except maybe weird stuff like fractional shares) are registered with the DTC and wouldn't typically be contested in the event of a brokerage failure,0,0.504,0.998,NEGATIVE

I’d rather have mental peace. $265K cost basis ensures that my capital is safe, and also some gains. I don’t see any advantage of sticking around to this portfolio any longer.",1,0.522,1.0,NEGATIVE

The limit is $500k, and that’s what you sign up for. No guarantee of intervention each time. And we had a once in a hundred years earthquake here in NJ recently. The vast majority of homeowners here don’t have the earthquake add on to their home insurance. Whereas in CA everyone does. Better to be safe than sorry.",3,0.509,1.0,NEGATIVE

BH has so much large sum of cash and can deal a once in a life time deal so they can “concentrate” and strike 1 time in 5 years.our individual investors are better off with a balanced portfolio. your portfolio history is too short, so you gain as a concentr portfolio, but longer term, our individual investors need to diversify and stay liquid.",2,0.532,0.993,NEGATIVE

AI alone could neutralize Google if the right service is released by another company. I know it’s extreme but Google could go the way of blockbuster. And the whole lack of monetizing issue could lead to a bubble, and collapse like the 90s tech bubble.I will look to concentrate then with dividend stocks like O, VZ, and Abbvie.
