,"Title says all, but truthfully don't know who to ask so this place seems like a good place to throw some ideas around. My current portfolio is currently and only concentrated in 7 stocks, there's a fair bit of diversity in it but it's mainly weighted on tech. I'll give a list for what I got and my reasoning for each, beyond the obvious that tech seems here to stay for many years (which is my goal for these accounts, retirement). AMD - Makes excellent processors, seems to be if not already beating Intel in market share and technology due to their head start with their newer CPUs. MSFT - I don't think this needs elaboration. RTX - Government defense contracts are a big reason, but they also own United Technologies now, which is a big manufacturer for HVAC components among other things, and in the future I see HVAC use trending upwards (if nothing else climate change will make things way hotter). TFC - Truist Financial, This is my bank is is actually a regional bank. But they are also the 10th largest bank in the US with assets ($509 Billion). Stock is just solid. TSM - They contract with both Intel and AMD for their processors. So if nothing else, if Intel and AMD should fail, either move the losses to TSM or just get out of tech in general. China poses a potential issue but I see this is a non-issue due to the rest of the world's reliance on Taiwan for their semiconductor production. VZ - Telecommunications company, I picked it over AT&T because it has far less debt. This is the dividend stock of the group. WMG - Warner Music Group, I would have rather picked UMG but they're not public. Music royalties mainly, they have quite a few artist I like in their catalog. Now, a preface: should this be taken as due diligence for anyone? No, not really, these are just MY personal picks, and I'm just trying to even it out because I don't like odd numbers. All of these companies could fail in the future and I'd sell at a loss and put it into SPY like the rest of us. But one of the best pieces of advice I ever heard was ""invest in things you understand"", and all of these are industries I've either worked in or am very familiar with. I'm not investing expert. That said, I want my next pick to be something a bit more old money conservative, so I've been considering some more unorthodox options - like SPGI or CME. Something that tracks the market (or literally OWNS the tracker, in these cases). BRK.B also seems like a strong choice. Any opinions?","There isn't a dual choice only between SPY and individual stocks. You can stick with what you know with ETFs, and cover a lot more ground, meaning two of your choices are semiconductors so bet on the industry, not specific companies that might lose out to competitors. So...SOXX for AMD (31 semiconductor stocks)XLK for MSFT (44% AAPL/MSFT, the rest 69 broad ""tech"" stocks including Visa and Mastercard at #4 and #5)XLF for TFC (the banking industry is never going away but a regional bank might; TFC is losing stock for five years while XLF is up 35%)SMH for TSM (26 semiconductors with TSM the largest exposure at 11%)Almost anything on Earth for VZ",0,0.537,0.964,NEGATIVE

My current portfolio is currently and only concentrated in 7 stocks, there's a fair bit of diversity in it but it's mainly weighted on tech. I'll give a list for what I got and my reasoning for each, beyond the obvious that tech seems here to stay for many years (which is my goal for these accounts, retirement). AMD - Makes excellent processors, seems to be if not already beating Intel in market share and technology due to their head start with their newer CPUs. MSFT - I don't think this needs elaboration. RTX - Government defense contracts are a big reason, but they also own United Technologies now, which is a big manufacturer for HVAC components among other things, and in the future I see HVAC use trending upwards (if nothing else climate change will make things way hotter). TFC - Truist Financial, This is my bank is is actually a regional bank. But they are also the 10th largest bank in the US with assets ($509 Billion). Stock is just solid. TSM - They contract with both Intel and AMD for their processors. So if nothing else, if Intel and AMD should fail, either move the losses to TSM or just get out of tech in general. China poses a potential issue but I see this is a non-issue due to the rest of the world's reliance on Taiwan for their semiconductor production. VZ - Telecommunications company, I picked it over AT&T because it has far less debt. This is the dividend stock of the group. WMG - Warner Music Group, I would have rather picked UMG but they're not public. Music royalties mainly, they have quite a few artist I like in their catalog. Now, a preface: should this be taken as due diligence for anyone? No, not really, these are just MY personal picks, and I'm just trying to even it out because I don't like odd numbers. All of these companies could fail in the future and I'd sell at a loss and put it into SPY like the rest of us. But one of the best pieces of advice I ever heard was ""invest in things you understand"", and all of these are industries I've either worked in or am very familiar with. I'm not investing expert. That said, I want my next pick to be something a bit more old money conservative, so I've been considering some more unorthodox options - like SPGI or CME. Something that tracks the market (or literally OWNS the tracker, in these cases). BRK.B also seems like a strong choice.

You, like nearly ALL stock pickers, will underperform. I would say like most you should spend MORE time researching on the actual numbers of stock picking vs. the actual stock picking itself. Link below shows the actual data over the last 30+ years from JPM wealth division (active management) for their OWN clients basically telling their own clients active stock picking LOSES in spectacular fashion.Highlights if you (or others) don't want to read it: the MEDIAN returns of the individual stocks over the time period is NEGATIVE -53%. The chances of finding a 5x+ stock is 7% of all stocks (so pretty darn hard/ unlikely).Their own analysis looked at how often it benefited adding a concentrated portfolio to an index fund portfolio and it came back as 0% of the time. Not a ringing endorsement from a group that makes money FROM active management.https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-wm-aem/global/pb/en/insights/eye-on-the-market/eotm-the-agony-and-the-ecstasy.pdf",0,0.543,1.0,NEGATIVE
