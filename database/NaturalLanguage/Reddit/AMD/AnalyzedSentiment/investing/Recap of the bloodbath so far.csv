AMD has also joined the party!","A lot of this is expected though and in the case of Fedex, there's some question as to how much of it is Fedex-specific. UPS is down over the last year as well, but not nearly as much as Fedex is. They also came out and said they were doing okay a day or two after the Fedex news.Nike earnings weren't bad - excess inventory was more than thought (stock was initally flat after earnings, then tanked after the inventory discussion started on the call) but really, excess inventory not surprising. Just another company dealing with bullwhip effect during this last couple of years.Chips not surprising with AMD/MU. You had a massive pull-forward with PCs, among other issues. Chip scarcity for some things has turned into a glut.Carmax - there's a business that doesn't do well at the slightest hint of economic cooling, but you also set a record for used car sales in 2021. Any pull-forward? Plus, when you raise rates through the roof you have Carmax understandably noting ""affordability issues.""Carnival Corporation - I don't get the appeal of cruises to begin with people already seemed skeptical about the sustainability of ""pent up demand"" months ago - travel stocks started sinking despite hotels (a better business than cruises and airlines, I don't get why Reddit has been so enamored with airlines and cruises) having enthusiastic earnings calls. As inflation continues the pent up demand could certainly continue to fizzle and travel isn't where you want to be in a recession or even a fragile economy.None of this is good, but I also think it's the end of the world or something either - and some of these should not be surprising.",0,0.554,1.0,NEGATIVE

They never care about stipulations with residential deliveries such as, say, an apartment complex or building with an office that closes.Back when I lived at one, I knew that if FedEx was delivering the packages I'd have to call the vendor to cancel the order. It would either be dropped in the bushes by the front gate, leave a sticker saying they couldn't deliver, or go to a neighbor's apartment. In the three years I lived at that complex, I successfully received a FedEx package maybe twice. UPS and USPS never had any issues.Funny thing is that the complex gave a gate opener and building keys to all three of them, but FedEx refused to use it. Likely because they relied on contractors and didn't even know who has it or who should have it.The only reason commercial delivery is better is that they usually have contracts stipulating when pickup and dropoff will be each day.",5,0.513,1.0,NEGATIVE

Stuff like that happens from time to time and has almost nothing to do with what carrier you use. I filled out their form and a few weeks later had a physical check for the exact $ value of the item.Ups I've had similar issues and at this point I know it's pointless to even attempt to contact them. Im convinced they intentionally make their customer service loop in a manner so that they never have to actually send out compensation checks or be held accountable, which sadly is likely the more profitable route even if they have to hire a few redundant workers that read scripts to enrage customers.Usps used to be good for this, but they seem grossly understaffed in this department, any request I've put in this past year is still just pending.I ship a lot and packages get lost or destroyed from time to time, im not some crabby customer who calls anytime a package gets dented.

Lots of analysts lowering estimates and forecasts, but they are still being absolutely irrational. Q3 isn't the bottom for these earnings, its just the beginning as employment hasn't even meaningfully dropped yet. All signs point to inflation having peaked, but if you paid attention to the White House's reaction to the OPEC production cut, you can tell they are very worried that energy prices will again push on inflation once the releases from the SPR end. Common themes across these early poor reporters seems to be a glut of inventory, a quickly deteriorating consumer, as well as extreme FX issues due to the too strong US dollar. Fedex is also a canary in the coal mine for all things ecommerce as well. Again, all this has occurred in Q3 and we haven't even seen unemployment make a meaningful rise.
