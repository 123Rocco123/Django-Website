,"Obviously no one knows, but what would you guys bet your money on if you had to choose one of these two bets, and why? Just looking for opinions Amd: Strike Around 240, expiring June 2025 Intel: Strike Around 55, expiring January 2026 I feel with Intel they have a lot of potential because they are starting to compete a little bit better with their new meteorlake chips, and by getting into the AI space. Intel is also a lot more cheaper and I can get a decent price for a further contract. This would give me some more time to hope for them to come up with something good. AMD is a lot more expensive for a contract expiring sooner. This doesn't give me much time and I don't know if they really are cooking up anything different from what they're already doing. AMD is a lot more reliable though.",I'm very long on AMD and have been in there since the $1.8. While I obviously enjoy the stock it is super unrealistic in my mind to reach 240 by June 2025. In this case I would say Intel considering they went up to the 48s and are a much bigger company and they are going to get their new fab strategy under control.,0,0.608,1.0,NEGATIVE

In my head there’s room for the stock to ease somewhat and then start to go up again long term. At the end of the day it’s still a gamble, but I’d give you 60/40 for AMD/Intel. Good luck.",0,0.562,0.994,NEGATIVE
