,"Nvidia might be a bit expensive today, but looking at the future and their competitors, I’m still long on Nvidia and this is why: In the last 6 months, their webpage traffic has almost doubled. From 22M in September to 36M in February. More visitors to their webpage tells me that more people are interested in their products. They are looking to hire more people than their competitors. Nvidia has currently around 1000 open positions, compared to 700 for AMD and 650 for Intel. This tells me that the company is growing. But it’s also interesting to see what kind of people they are hiring. I like that they are looking to hire people for their Autonomous Vehicles Platform - huge future opportunity. Highest employee rating in the industry. People like working for Nvidia (if we should trust sites like Glassdoor and Indeed), more so than their competitors. The CEO approval is at an all time high and I believe that this will help them attract even more great people in the future.

Nvidia has currently around 1000 open positions, compared to 700 for AMD and 650 for Intel. This tells me that the company is growing. But it’s also interesting to see what kind of people they are hiring. I like that they are looking to hire people for their Autonomous Vehicles Platform - huge future opportunity. Highest employee rating in the industry. People like working for Nvidia (if we should trust sites like Glassdoor and Indeed), more so than their competitors. The CEO approval is at an all time high and I believe that this will help them attract even more great people in the future. On top of this, financials looks rock solid with increasing revenue year over year.
