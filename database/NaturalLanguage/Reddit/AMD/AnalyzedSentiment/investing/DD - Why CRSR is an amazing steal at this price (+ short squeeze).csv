It depends if you are an investor or trader mainly, but even with Eagle Tree being the majority holder, share lock ups and dilutions will always affect a stock one way or another, usually negatively. CRSR can go sub $25 in the worst case and make aloooot of new bagholders by making them think it’s done dipping. You should also consider the bear case they stated in their earnings, warnings of slowing growth and a niche market for gaming.Other lock ups to consider:SNOW lock upPLTR lock upQS lock upDASH lock up (coming up soon)What there is, is a chance for a deadcat bounce or bull trap, similar to what happened on PLTR, but I would consider that a lucky case because of the big 5 million buy that was well timed. People might try to swing trade it because CRSR is very oversold right now, as is the entire market. But I recommend analyzing what happened with other share lock ups and how they’re doing now. One thing to consider is that if everyone knows a lock up is coming, wouldn’t it be the easiest money grab to short it? The market isn’t usually that easy.You don’t need to buy every dip. It’d be smart to wait for a floor so you don’t catch a falling knife.",1,0.531,0.978,NEGATIVE

Like a subscription service that send you upgrades for your gaming PC every few months. Swap it out and send back the old part which they sell on the secondary markets to increase margins.They keep releasing new products that are pretty top notch.

Short interest doesn't seem to be significant.IPO lockup expiring March 22nd -- every thread on CRSR mentions this, but not many talk about the actual numbers. There are ~14M shares that are eligible for unlock, and the current float is ~26M. Its hard to tell how many of those shares have actually been awarded to employees, but it is reasonable to expect existing shareholders to take profits leading up to the unlock, as well as employees looking to cash out of vested incentive stock options.Semiconductor shortage -- you hear about this affecting the auto industry, but it has far reaching effects. CRSR's earnings call a month ago, the CEO specifically called out semiconductor lead times as a risk factor for their ability to react to increased demand in 2021. [1]Supply chain constraints -- related to above, in parts of 2020 they had very low inventory levels down to 1 week or less left of supply (in hardware this is a very thin buffer) and were ""sold out through most of last year"" (actual words said on the earnings call) which means even though they did great and grew over 100% in Q4, they could have sold more. [1]Controlled Company -- as others have mentioned, Eagletree Capital (a PE firm) owns the bulk of shares ~61M. What you dont hear is Eagletree also have 5 of 8 board seats (so more than 60% of the voting power) and the ""controlled company"" status has some potential downsides: different reporting requirements, fewer rights to shareholders, and a board that may serve the interests of a single stockholder.
