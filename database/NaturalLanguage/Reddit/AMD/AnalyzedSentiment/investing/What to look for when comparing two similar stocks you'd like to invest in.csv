,"I have always wondered, is there a standard set of things to look for when trying to decided which of two similar stocks you'd like to invest in. Say, something like INTC vs AMD. Are there are a standard criteria which you can use to appraise both companies? Just curious.","All else equal, entry valuation.In general: return on invested capital is a big one for me, margins, liquidity, etc.Basically just look at each set of metrics against industry averages (given they're in the same respective spaces if they're similar) and judge which deserves a premium multiple.However, I fundamentally disagree with how you're picking stocks here since you're not beginning with what I believe to be the right screening criteria. Companies within semiconductors, GPUs, AI, etc. are all trading way too frothy.Look for good businesses at great entry valuations. i.e. I'd rather invest in a business that has a proven history of steadily growing earnings that is trading well below its normal multiples, than INTC which hasn't been run all too well and is insanely expensive at a ~42x multiple of earnings.",0,0.532,1.0,NEGATIVE

You can research at Yahoofinance, CNBC, wallmine etc. and then compare what these stock is best. The most importan is what about two stock have best growth in next year or current year.",0,0.644,0.969,NEGATIVE

But not helpful... I'm not great at evaluating fundamentals, I'm more of a technicals guy. But i would look at balance sheets, quarterly guidances, and so on. I've been hearing a lot more good things about AMD recently, i believe they're trying to make some big moves into AI, whereas I havent heard anything about INTC in AI, I'm sure they must be up to something but I havent heard much about them.I would just look at the numbers, though, maybe looks at P/Es, forward P/Es. And then look at technicals, see the graphs, I sell parabolic moves, even if I'm a little early from the peak, then I wait for it to come back down to a comfortable price point.",0,0.548,1.0,NEGATIVE
