Whether you picked something like Costco or if you went with Target, you've earned somewhere around 18% per year if we're simply looking back over your five year (2015 - present) time frame.

Do people still buy stocks as they go down or do you go cashLike with any crash, there is fear thereafter. Dot com happened and the accounting scandals begun.. Enron, world-com, tyco..

Have a look at Amazon from 99 to 01.. it later bottomed at $5.xx after having gone up $5 to $100 in under a year from 98-99.https://i.imgur.com/QZcU2OI.jpgAmazons historical chart is especially nice because the stock has never split. The prices you see are what they were back then.—-Once average Joe got accustomed to the reality that stocks are “dangerous” and “you can’t live in your worthless share certificates”... on came the next great investment to make that you that big money you saw just a few years ago... real estate.So no.. not too many people were talking about stocks until 06-07 and that’s when the cracks in real estate were coming through. We know the rest of the story.On a side note.. Dot com started showing cracks when the fed raised the rates in quick succession spooking the market. It went higher but there was fear. The accounting scandals, 9/11, war in Afghanistan, then Iraq, hurricane katrina etc all happened back to back to back. No exactly “safe” from an average Joe’s point of view.Anyway.. people are always looking to make fast money. It happens again and again.. junk bonds in the late 80s early 90s, “internet” stocks in 97-00, real estate and housing derivatives 05-08. You can see the same patterns play out today in crypto markets, EV and SPAC’s. No one asks questions on how this technology can actually be used to make money.

Invested $20 here, $30 there in various penny stocks. They all went South after the Reddit Motley Fool hype died down. I didn't sell them and out of the 12 or 15, 2 of them took off years later and more than made up for the others. APPS was one of them and MVIS. My $20 into APPS is now over $500. Wish I did more!
