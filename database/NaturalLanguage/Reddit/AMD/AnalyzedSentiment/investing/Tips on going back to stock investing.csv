Thanks for your suggestions","VTI/VOO are going to be great over long periods of time. If seeing drops makes you want to run then you may need to research things other than stocks. Even in ""safe"" things there will be variance. VTI is down almost 17% in the last 6 months (not the 40% you were experiencing granted but maybe that is still too much for your risk tolerance?) Just keep that in mind.r/bogleheads is another place to check out. It sounds like a way of investing that you are leaning towards.",0,0.52,0.87,NEGATIVE

Thanks for your suggestions","I disagree with your 2nd sentence. Capital impairment on any given position is a real risk. Depending on the size of the position and materiality of the change in the underlying business, this can then lead to a portfolio-level capital impairment, ie. the money is effectively lost “forever” (forever as a proxy for a reasonable timeframe to recoup part or whole of the investment). If a given position is 10% of the portfolio and it goes down 70%, it doesn’t matter that you didn’t press “sell” yet. This position would need to move up ~3.5x just for you to break even mathematically. A 3.5x move is a massive rerate, and it isn’t going to happen “because I never sell”.

A crash can easily go 50 or 60% down if 100% stock(VT or VTI or VOO). So anyone that is recommending you go 100% stock is ridiculous.So you can start super conservative, say the ETF AOK(30% stocks) and wait until the next crash and then re-evaluate. You should expect a worst case around 15%.Or you can start middle of the road say the ETF AOR(60% stocks) and wait until the next crash and then re-evaluate. You should expect a worst case of around 30% down.Or get ""aggressive"" with AOA (80% stocks).

Right now I'm really scared of losing it all, before selling everything I could barely sleep and was checking the news all the time, today the feeling is gone but now I'm looking for a less volatile alternative. Was thinking dcing into Vti / voo ? Or something that can get me a 5% apy safely would be great. This investing (well now I realize that tech is mostly gambling) journey has left me exhausted I just want a safe place to park my money. Thanks for your suggestions","You have learned more about your risk tolerance. Everyone has one. If a down market causes you increased levels of stress and causes you to sell while it's down big, then your asset allocation is too heavily invested in equities.Ways to mitigate this- increase the amount of cash that you hold, increase your percentage in bonds, look for alternative assets such as real estate.And, for the equity side, set up automatic investments into a low cost, widely diversified index fund. Have these automatic investments set up once a week or once a month, and then just hardly ever check it. This is what I do for the majority of my investments. I trust the research done with this approach over time, and let compounding over time do its thing. Then I focus on other things- such as my hobbies, or other ways to try to increase my income as opposed to increase my investment gains.",0,0.548,0.851,POSITIVE
,"Hi all, I started investing in the stock market since March 2021, unfortunately high growth tech stocks past performance returns really lured me in, so I started investing on them heavily even using some margin, long story short 2022 arrived and they got hammered turns out my personal risk tolerance is way less than I thought recently I panicked and closed all my positions (stuff like $msft $aapl $nvda $amd) my portfolio is -40% down vs my initial deposit.
