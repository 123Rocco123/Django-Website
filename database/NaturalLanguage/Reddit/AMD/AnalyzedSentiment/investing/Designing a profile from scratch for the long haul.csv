For just a few examples:Oil stocks like CVX are no longer dependable after the recent oil crisis, cannot be seen as flight-to-safety stocks, and will experience increasing headwinds from renewable energy. Instead, invest in renewable energy.The ""classics"" pseudo-sector is a bit of a scattered idea.Your other attempts at covering sectors are not well-diversified.You should avoid ARK funds unless you're fine losing money. They're untested and currently demonstrating that with rapid losses.Ford, GM and Tesla are strange bedfellows indeed. Ford is doing its best to turn the company around, but not so long ago suspended their dividend and were in serious danger of failing (despite having a lot of cash, they also had big liabilities and a scattered product focus). GM is not as good of a bet long-term as, say, Toyota. Tesla stock is an incredibly overpriced joke at this point. If you're going to specialize in automotive, pick better.Your tech picks are also not the best. You're focusing on many of the incredibly over-pumped megacaps that are currently ponderously crashing. Instead, buy safer, more diversified funds like XITK and QQQJ that focus on emerging leaders.I think you'd be best off with a fund-of-funds approach.

I'd reallly hesitate on that one. AB Inbev is struggling to maintain control of the beer market with the growth of craft beer, and looking at alcohol as a whole, consumers are drinking significantly less beer and more seltzer, spirits, wine and cider. I don't see any reason for that trend to reverse. They're getting slammed on both sides. Less customers buying beer, and every year craft breweries are siphoning customers away. American style lagers are among the fastest growing craft beer styles right now, and have been for a few years as more and more bud-drinkers convert to buying local.As a long term investment, I think AB Inbev is a very bad prospect.",0,0.534,1.0,NEGATIVE
