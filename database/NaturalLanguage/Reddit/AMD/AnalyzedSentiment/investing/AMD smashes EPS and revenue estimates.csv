Assuming similar proportional increases in R&D and marketing as last year (which tbh I think is relatively conservative, I think it'd be closer to the absolute increases in operating expenses), we're looking at a total of $3.8bn on R&D and marketing, making for an EBITDA of $2.2bn, an increase of over 70%.

You tell your CPU to do things by talking to it using in that language.CPUs are designed to understand that language quickly so it can get to doing work quickly. Software is designed to talk in that language efficiently so the CPU doesn't have to do as much work trying to understand what the software really means.What happened over the past decade or two is that Intel became mostly uncontested in the CPU world, so everyone spoke in Intel's language (which was x86). So Intel would only understand things that it knew how to do well, and everyone would write software in a way that would talk in a way that Intel could understand faster. So Intel had an advantage because everyone used its language that was mostly designed to be good at things Intel knew how to be fast in.What if instead of being fast only on things Intel was good at being fast at, the language we used to talk to our computer was fast at things we wanted computers to be fast at? So that's ARM.So the difference in how the language looks: x86 would have instructions like ""make me a sandwich"", ""make me margarita"", ""stir fry this with broccoli"". While ARM would have instructions like ""fry this"", ""mix this"", ""cut this"". So everyone had to make their x86 CPUs know about all these different foods Intel knew how to cook, while with ARM you just had to tell it what cooking technique to use. But then what happens when you try to make food Intel doesn't know about? You get some hilarious complicated instructions like ""make me a carrot sandwich and remove the bread and cheese and meat and stir fry it with broccoli and then remove the broccoli"" in x86 which would just be ""stir fry some carrots"" in ARM.So Apple and Amazon thinks computers should be good at saving energy, so they each made chips that was good at that, and ARM lets you talk in a way that saves energy. If you wanted your CPU to be fast at cutting, you just make it fast at cutting when you tell it to cut. Instead of, be faster at making margaritas in case we need to cut limes, be faster at making sandwiches in case we need to cut lettuce and tomatoes and so on.Well the big con is, much of the software we use today is still talking in a way that is designed to be fast for Intel to understand. So you have to waste energy to translate. But as more software gets translated and updated to run faster on ARM, they'll likely start to run slower on x86.As for Intel, it has either either waste energy translating ARM back to something it understands, or start being good at things it never knew how to be good at.",4,0.519,0.959,NEGATIVE

ARM is not compatible with things complied for X86 (Intel, and most AMD chips). The biggest factor here is probably Microsoft, they flirted a bit with making Windows for ARM but nothing of substance has come to fruition from them (in 2017 they announced that it would be available by the end of the year, it's now 2021 and no sign of it yet, most have written it off as vaporware at this point). Not being able to buy/install Microsoft Server on a computer running an ARM chip is a pretty big deal breaker for a lot of server admins. If you are Linux shop though using ARM is a lot easier, although you still have to be careful that all the applications you need on Linux have versions compiled for ARM.Here is a recent article by someone comparing two AWS EC2 instances (one x86 and one ARM) and running postgresql (a popular database) benchmarks. The TL;DR is basically the ARM instances are cheaper to rent and postgresql runs better across the board. https://www.percona.com/blog/2021/01/22/postgresql-on-arm-based-aws-ec2-instances-is-it-any-good/EDIT: Apple is getting around this (not having all/most Mac OS applications compiled for ARM at this point) with Rossetta 2, which is sort of like an x86 emulator that runs on ARM (but is specific to Mac OS).EDIT 2: If Microsoft changed its tune and it looked like Windows for ARM was going to be a thing, then I would probably sell my AMD position (unless AMD had new ARM chips coming out for the datacenter at the time).",3,0.534,1.0,NEGATIVE

All of you who filled me in about Arm are incredibly knowledgeable and great at explaining things.A coworker of mine with programming friends at Microsoft mentioned that Windows is going in a dramatically different angle moving forward. I think he said they planned on streamlining a lot of their products so maybe Arm is finally in the cards.Why would you sell your AMD stock though wouldn’t they be able to license the Arm architecture from Nvidia, despite how ruthless they are they would get anti trust sued for strong arming AMD and definitely lose wouldn’t they?",4,0.552,0.999,POSITIVE

While there are rumors that started back in December that AMD is already working on ARM chips, designing chips from the ground up is not a fast process. I don’t remember the exact amount of time it took AMD to develop Zen (what Ryzen and Epyc are based on), I think it was at least 3 years. So yes if Windows server and all the software that server admins care about were suddenly compatible with ARM then I would probably sell. If Microsoft announced Windows server for ARM and AMD was about a year out from releasing ARM server chips, then that is a different story.",5,0.56,0.999,NEGATIVE

TSMC shortages are affecting them a lot, and visibly Intel is benefiting huge from this lag. Doesn't help to have better chips when you can't make em.Intel's beat was almost AMD's whole revenue.On that note, I don't see why people want Intel to sell its fabs to get in line for this. Meanwhile, Intel just booked out all of TSMC's enhanced 7 nm nodes for its GPUs, which is a cockblock for AMD improving its CPUs. TSMC scheduling a lot more capacity for cars over computers. How is AMD planning to address this? This just gives Intel more time to continue to squash the bug and secure deals as AMD's ability to get chips to the customers that want them is just not reliable.",0,0.548,1.0,NEGATIVE
