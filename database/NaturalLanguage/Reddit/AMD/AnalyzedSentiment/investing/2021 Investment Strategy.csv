,"Hey, over time I have changed my portfolio from a diversified dividend stock portfolio (12-14 stocks) now switched to an ultra concentrated high growth portfolio. Everyone is different and need to decide which strategy suits their risk tolerance the best. As a young investor my goal is to maximise growth, having an ultra concentrated strategy has by fair been the better for growth for me by far this year. Diversification leads to average returns, it seems in this crazy market anyway I hold only TSLA 45%, TTCF 25%, AMD 15%, NIO 5%, 5% cash However TSLA has grown so much, surely will need to take some profit eventually. AMD has been more stable but all growth stocks seems to be majorly overvalued. The general consensus is bullish for 2021, low interest rates, more QE potentially as the fed said they’re continue to use all tools within their means. Is anyone worried about next year? Or which signs are you looking out for in the market in case there’s a crash? Potential hike in interest rates could be the catalyst for a crash?

Similar i suppose to Berkshire Hathaway with AAPL (not comparing myself to Warren Buffet...).TSLA's growth story is still there, but I no longer have a balanced portfolio. I could continue to hold, sell back to my target % allocation, or sell less than that.

Open to any ideas about my asset allocation and general ideas! Happy New Year!","Hey, nice post. Update from me since my first post. I recently sold 22 shares of TSLA out of the 90 that I had before a month ago when it went up to 860 (sold @837). I then think the timing was a bit lucky but put 60% of those gains into CCIV. I think rebalancing is healthy, and gives you chances to take opportunities when they arise. When comparing my portfolio before and after the rebalance, it boosted my return significantly.So what is my plan going forward? As the markets keep rising, I will keep scaling out of my other holdings apart from TSLA to increase cash. I feel more comfortable having higher cash levels to take advantage of those dips, and at some point this market would have to correct back to reality.I am attached to TSLA and found it hard to sell, but looked like a good decision in hindsight now. The growth story is still there for sure, if TSLA dips and the price is right at a discount I would move gains from my other stocks into TSLA as I think in the long run it will be a $1Trillion company. So what I’m trying to get at is that it is basically the only company I’m confident holding long now for the next 10 years.In terms of your 20% allocation to mega growth stocks, what are you inclined to do? Are you thinking to lock in profit and rebalance? Have a plan, set a price where you would want to sell some TSLA shares, then reinvest it into your other ETF’s or something you feel more comfortable taking less risk with It really depends how you feel. There’s no harm in taking some profit off the table and waiting for the next opportunity. I personally think increasing cash in this market is prudent. People are becoming euphoric and think it’s too easy to make money with these growth stocks. That’s my piece. Cheers",1,0.538,0.682,NEGATIVE

I also have huge faith in the ongoing success of TSLA, but right now the price is very high. I'd rather have a little more in fixed interest for times of lower exuberance in the market.My plan with growth stocks is to allow them to grow quite a bit out of my allocation before balancing, and not selling so much as to put them all the way back to their allocation. I read Howard Marks' latest essay and he seems to be coming around to his sons understanding that 'super compounders' shouldn't be sold due to their rarity. With TSLA I think the growth story is amazing, but say they become the standard for electric vehicles, self driving ai, industrial power storage and grid storage - what % of the overall economy would they represent? My point is that there is limit to growth in anything. So I agree, it's good to take a little profit from the star growth holdings. It feel boring to take 5k out of TSLA and put it into a diversified bond ETF, but that's me following the plan.Yes it's hard to be taking profit from a stock that has done so well and shows so much more potential, but I'm feeling more and more like the marker is too hot and we're in for some pain. Always want to have some safer assets so I can get in on any dips.Thanks again for sharing your story. Really appreciate it!",2,0.533,1.0,NEGATIVE
