In particular, I am enthusiastic about their products and acquisitions in the non-retail software space because they exhibit a coherent, business focused strategy that will capture a growing cohort of software developers.VScode, Github, and Azure present a powerful ecosystem of developer tools. VSCode, an IDE, is in my opinion very polished and productive, the best I've ever used. This ecosystem has an inherited userbase thanks to the popularity of Github.Combined with LinkedIn, you have a software suite that greatly enables the productivity and job-placement of software developers. And the businesses employing these developers are often heavily invested in the Office suite; they also use SSO, Teams, etc.MSFT is poised to win the dollars of the one segment of the economy that is going gangbusters in this new era. In my opinion, they are ""selling picks and shovels to the gold rush.""",1,0.529,1.0,POSITIVE

The share price is 103.71$. Rather than display these two pieces of information, we often compress it into ""how much is the return on my investment"". In this case we would take 1.7/103.71=0.0164x100=1.64%. So for every dollar you invest, you can expect 1.64 cents back this year.When i purchased CN Rail back in april, my cost was 85.00 for a share. However it was still paying 1.70$ as a dividend. Thus i got a higher percentage (return) on my investment. 1.7/85=0.02x100=2.0%. so the dividend payment stayed the same, the cost of this return has increased since then.Often, an profitable and established company that pays a dividend will increase their dividend yearly to coincide with increased profit for the year. I have calculated that over the last 30 years CN rail has increased their dividend by an average of 16% per year. If we assume this profitable trend should continue; a chart appears:2020 = 1.70$ dividend per share2021 = 1.7x1.16 = 1.97$ dividend per share2022 = 1.97x1.16 = 2.28$2023 = 2.28x1.16 = 2.65$ (i'm going to skip the arithmetic now to make this chart go faster)2024 = 3.072025 = 3.572026 = 4.142027 = 4.82028 = 5.572029 = 6.462030 = 7.5and so on into perpetuity. As these dividends keep increasing, the value of owning a stock should increase as well proportionally. Using this maths by 2050 each share of CN Rail should be paying you 146$ in dividends every year. it is up to the individual investor to decide how much that return is worth to you at that time. However as the stock is now at a 1.64% ratio, lets assume that we in the future will give this a similar price, putting the price of the stock somewhere around 8900.00$ per share. This is the overall concept of common stock investing:How much money does a stock promise to pay me right nowHow much money will it pay me in the futureHow quickly am i going to get this moneyHow much is this money going to cost me",4,0.572,0.999,NEGATIVE
