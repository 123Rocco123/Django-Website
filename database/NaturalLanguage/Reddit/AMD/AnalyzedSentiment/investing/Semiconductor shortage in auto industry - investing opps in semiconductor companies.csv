They are also a major player in Lidar chipsets which auto companies are going to need more of to compete with the likes of Tesla or other EV companies that use that as their main driverless technology. Lidar is also starting to be included on smartphones for 3d imaging which is being employed in a host of new markets like real estate, construction, drone technology, and robotics control. I agree that a lot of people are just looking at market cap vs price here and are scratching their head and saying buy buy buy, but there is an upside to it.

That's why chip manufacturers have been unable to expand to meet both automotive and gaming demand at the same time, because their expansion plans were based on the pre-pandemic purchase contracts. Also automakers are ridiculously stingy with their suppliers, don't expect any of their suppliers to be able to negotiate higher profit deals.",0,0.541,0.999,NEGATIVE

Well... they always sell when they offer stock, the price still goes up, and by the way: they raised over $1B in capital to facilitate the changes I listed above. They are a steal if you compare them to others in the industry; only you shouldn't, because their 3d printing business model is literally a game-changer compared to traditional manufacturing. Let alone the security/proprietary benefits they offer customers just by the nature of it.I'm honestly shocked they haven't caught on yet.
