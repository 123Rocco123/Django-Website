,"As a 25year old low commitment employee, want to start DCA into the stock market consistently should I invest in one more ETF to get a 3-fund portfolio? I own 1 each of QQQM and VTI. I’m bullish on tech and AI so I got stocks of AAPL, TSLA, NVDA, MSFT, GOOG and AMD about 1 or 2 each. Because I’m quite bullish on tech, should I look to get VGT as well? And DCA in it? Or continue to get individual stocks? Is it a good idea to sell and get profit of my individual stocks and put them all into ETF?","VXUS makes sense to add.
