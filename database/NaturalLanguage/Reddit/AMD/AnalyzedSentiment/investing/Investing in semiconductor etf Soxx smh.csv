,"I have about 20% of my portfolio in Soxx and smh. The rest is in other tech etf, mainly internet tech companies. I'm skeptic about the growth rate of semiconductor. Even though I think semiconductor market would grow. But I'm not sure the rate would match other tech companies. There is also a concern that as semiconductor get more advanced, it'll gradually become more expensive that people are unwilling to spend on overpriced CPU and GPU. My question is if it is worthwhile to invest in Soxx/smh over other tech etf. Or should I just invest in the top performer in the semiconductor sector such as Nvidia/Intel/Amd/tsmc etc.","Data is the new oil.Nvidia, amd, tsm are what the oil companies were in the industrial economy.Now we are in a tech economy, and need semis.The next shift is in green/clean tech as well spend decades battling climate change.",0,0.572,0.997,POSITIVE

There are many smaller suppliers who are positioned to make money during the EUV transitions. Chips will get more expensive, but fabs are getting more expensive as well. We're not at the end of the road here, actually we're at the beginning of a huge transition in the fab space. ETFs also gives you access to newcomers in the space. It's likely there will be some startups in the AI space that get big in the coming years.The only issue I see is that you aren't invested in the Chinese semi space. They will grow 10x over the next 10 years because China is explicitly putting that industry into hyper drive due to sanctions. Even if it's only growth driven by internal consumption in easy to develop areas like Dram, there will be massive growth for companies like Smicy and the companies backing the nation's massive surveillance systen and the AI processing backend for it that's being built out.",0,0.531,0.93,POSITIVE

But the price seemed too high at the time and all the stock in there seemed to be at a bubble. So I sold it at a loss.Chik is Chinese version of vgt.,1,0.543,0.997,NEGATIVE

Both are weighed similar with similar number of holdings, and the top 10 tickers make up about 66% of the weight of the ETFs, but SMH has more exposure to TSM, NVDA, AMD, and ASML according to etf.com. The biggest differences in the exposure of those 4 tickers are between TSM and ASML where SOXX has a little over 5% TSM and 3% ASML, but SMH is showing 14% TSM and 5% ASML.",0,0.525,0.999,NEGATIVE
