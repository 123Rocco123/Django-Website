,"Hi Everyone, I've been investing for about a year now, but I have been unsure of what route to take as far as the kind of investing to commit to. Currently I have a mix of growth/dividend stocks, but I am undecided between fully growth, or fully dividend. I don't make much and can only put in about 100 a month. Currently my portfolio is: APPL, ABNB,AMD,AMZN,BIP,CHPT,CRWD,GNOM,GOOGL,JNJ,LCID,NVDA,PG,QCOM,PLTR,SOFI,SQ,TROW.

Thank you!","If you want to let a portfolio sit for 15-20 knowing that it is safe and growing, your best bet is just leaving your money in an index.

For example, if your portfolio is up $100 and you want to switch, you will need to pay tax on the gains. This means you are no longer investing and growing that $100 but rather $100 - tax rate. If you do not have any taxes because your portfolio went down because of the market this year, there's not really any reason not to allocate as desired as you won't have tax implication. Also if your money is in tax advantaged account, you don't have tax implication either.",2,0.54,0.96,POSITIVE

Thank you!","I'd say moderate redo. A bit much tech and things like PLTR and SOFI may have short squeezes if growth continues to bounce but I think it'll be a long time - if ever - before they get back to prior highs. Fintech (SQ, SOFI) is an area that I liked a few years ago, but it became oversaturated, a lot of services basically imo became commoditized (trading crypto, etc) and things that are hot fintech stories when times are good (""Upstart is AI lending!"") reveal risks when things turn South (taking a lot of loans on their books when the securitzation market started to get chilly.) When times are good Sofi is a ""disruptive digital bank!"" but when that changes, a bank is a bank and what kind of risks have they taken? I wouldn't want to own either.Maybe ASML instead of QCOM. TMO or DHR instead of JNJ. I think AirBNB was a beneficiary during the pandemic, but lately it feels like more and more complaints about high fees, bad experiences, etc - works for larger groups, but with rising cleaning fees and other hassles I have to wonder if people go back to hotels in a lot of cases. I would not own BIP as that is a partnership. If you want to own it I'd say own the C corp version, BIPC or get some exposure through parent co BAM",0,0.521,1.0,NEGATIVE

It's impossible for you to thoroughly research all of those companies you are investing in and with the reltiavely small amount you are putting in, it isn't worth your time. Minimize your holdings to fewer companies and add to those winners instead. You aren't a hedge fund who has to diversify out of requirement... don't diversify just because you think it limits risk. What limits risk is doing due diligence - not buying 50 different companies that you possibly can't keep track of. Alternatively, the best way to diversify is to just buy an index fund or ETF... they do all the work for you.",0,0.523,1.0,NEGATIVE

I think what you have is a good start I wouldn't mess with it too much considering you're not in the red.More diversification outside the NASDAQ and tech all together might be something to research for future investments.Also, including a stable allocation of quality ETFs will give you a better solid floor.You mentioned you have been investing for a year. I'm going to assume that some but not all of your investments you have held are older than a year. Please hold on to whatever you do decide to sell for at least a year. This way you're subjected to long terms capital gains tax (15%) instead of it being added on to your federal income tax. This alone can make a huge difference. You mentioned you don't make a lot of money right now... I get that but one day you will. Now's the time to set good habits for the trades you make.Again congrats on a positive first year.

,"Hi Everyone, I've been investing for about a year now, but I have been unsure of what route to take as far as the kind of investing to commit to. Currently I have a mix of growth/dividend stocks, but I am undecided between fully growth, or fully dividend. I don't make much and can only put in about 100 a month. Currently my portfolio is: APPL, ABNB,AMD,AMZN,BIP,CHPT,CRWD,GNOM,GOOGL,JNJ,LCID,NVDA,PG,QCOM,PLTR,SOFI,SQ,TROW.

Thank you!","Since the average length of time that a company is on the S&P is 20 years, then its staticky likely that at least one of those companies is not going to be around in 15-20 years, and also likely that there will be a company at the top in 15-20 years that does not even exist as of today.So I would not go totally all out on the idea of ""sit 15-20 years"". Revisit it at least every few years or so to see if a company is no longer what it once was.See also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfMFDcuDKYA",0,0.586,1.0,NEGATIVE
