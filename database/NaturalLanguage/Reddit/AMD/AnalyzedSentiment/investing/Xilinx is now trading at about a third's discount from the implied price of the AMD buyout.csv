That alone is worth more than AMDs consumer sales. And will boost amd for at least the next year. Maybe Intel can get it together and release a new die that is competitive like the pentium m, amd64, core I, and ryzen.However all of those families that made them swap places were years apart from each other to react and come to market.Intels platform is extremely mature, even when they finally manage to die shrink, they are still using the same architecture. Something which they are running out of ways to optimize.Zen, on the other hand, is basically brand new and will continue to improve at the same pace it is currently at for a good while.There is nothing in the immediate pipeline for Intel that looks like it can really compete with amd x86. The only thing left is the big/little architecture to bring down power consumption, which is really trying more to compete with arm encroaching on x86 market share than x86 compute.",4,0.561,0.542,NEGATIVE

I was referring to the stock price, not sales.the thing is, dominating for ""at least the next year"" isn't quite enough for me to justify buying into a 20x+ share price increase in an industry that has a three year runway on products coming to market.What do you mean? I would expect something like a 20x share price increase from something that was criminally undervalued before because of how important processor offerings available this year is.When it comes to Datacenter compute, the current offerings on the market now, and for the next year, are going to determine what is put in almost every cloud server for the next 4/5 years. Almost every major Datacenter operator has long refresh contracts, and there are no compelling Intel products in the pipeline for Intel to beat AMD by the time these contracts get signed next.AMD's server offerings are already on the market. Intel was targeting to have 7nm in 2017, and then 5nm in 2019 (like Zen was targeted for) specifically for this critical window. Intel is still looking at a minimum of 3 years timeline for a new architecture that can compete with a mature Zen platform.Going back to refresh cycles in 2020/2021. Amazon for example, now has a 4 year server refresh cycle.. These cycles are to ensure that they always have supply like most contract buyers. But more importantly its there to ensure a standardization in the hardware compatibility, performance, and expectations. Which is important when you are running the biggest cloud provider in the world.From the 2019 Q4 Amazon Earnings call:There's enough trend now to show that the useful life (for servers) is exceeding 4 years. For our servers, we had been depreciating them over 3 years. So we are going to start depreciating them on a 4-year basis. It doesn't unwind any depreciation that's already been booked. It just takes the asset from its current status and extends the depreciation period, and then new assets will be put into play -- will extend out for 4 years instead of 3, and we'll continue to revisit this.Since AWS' beginnings, they have selected Intel as the provider of their x86 hardware. As you can see, they switched from 3 to 4 year for the coming contract. Q4 2020 was supposed to be when they signed a new 3 year new contract (with intel), but they pushed it Q4 2021. You can see the effect this had on Intel's data center earnings.in 2019, There was a dip in revenue as Amazon was readying for the next generation of their servers, and in 2020 Intel's operating profits have decreased dramatically while shipping more chips and revenue remaining stagnant. if you look at Q1 and Q2 of this year, it is even more dramatic. Intel is selling the chips at a much deeper discount to AWS/Cloud providers. Not a good look when the refresh contract has expired and you believe you are going to get the next one.Further adding to this is the fact Google has already signed and announced their refresh contract with AMD in June, and Microsoft signed AMD Epyc last year for HPC compute, and when their refresh cycle finishes in the next year or 2 (not sure what their schedule is), it makes sense to continue to be consistent if AMD is still on top.As expected, AMD's DC sales have skyrocketed as adoption has grown, and will continue as DC providers retire old Intel hardware and replace them with AMD. AWS is signing their 4 year refresh contract this year, and all the signs point to it going to Epyc. They can no longer wait, and Intel will not be able to provide a compelling solution in time for this contract that can compete. Ice Lake was their last ditch effort and has significant shortcomings in efficiency and density.Epyc is denser, more powerful, and more efficient than anything Intel has now, or can put into writing for the future (which doesn't even help, given their track record). So it a safe bet that for at least the next 4 years, AMD will be the dominant chip being put in new servers powering the cloud and datacenters around the world.This year determines the next four.",6,0.585,0.868,NEGATIVE

Xilinx fell 3.7%, while AMD rose 5.9%. Several other technology deals that also need Chinese antitrust approval also saw their spreads widen today.One reason for Xilinx's (XLNX) move down may be that risk arb investors can't handle the potential downside for Xilinx (XLNX) if a deal with AMD (AMD) were to fall apart as AMD's shares continue to rocket higher, according to CNBC's David Faber. CNBC's Jim Cramer also said he believed that AMD (AMD) has become a meme stock at this point. AMD shares have jumped almost 25% in the past two weeks.In addition a Dealreporter column from last night may be contributing to weakness in the spreads. The opinion piece points out that China's leaders appear to have changed their tone about the importance of technology in late May and may have put the country on a ""technology war footing."" The U.S. and South Korean's announcement to fund multi-billion dollar semiconductor factories may also have contributed to China's potential slowdown on approving the U.S. deals.As far as Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) planned purchase of Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM), the Dealreporter column says the timing is uncertain. Last month traders circulated a report that the timing for Chinese approval had moved out as some customer have issues with export controls, though the deal was still likely to be approved.Risk arb investors may also be ""de-risking"" due to heightened antitrust risk after Aon (NYSE:AON) and Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) abandoned their $30B deal last week after the U.S. sued to block the deal and after a report from The Information last night that the U.S. DOJ is considering filing a lawsuit to block UnitedHealth's planned $8B purchase of Changed Healthcare (NASDAQ:CHNG).Last month MLex reported that the AMD's (AMD) purchase of Xilinx (XLNX) is expect to see a Phase Two review by Chinese antitrust regulators. China's State Administration for Market Regulation or SAMR is believed to have reached out to industry participants a few months ago to find out their views on market definitions and market shares.Other deal spreads that are wider today include Maxim (MXIM)/Analog Devices (ADI) and Coherent (NASDAQ:COHR)/II-VI(NASDAQ:IIVI).Also last week it was reported that China's review of Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) planned purchase of Arm Holdings (ARMHF) was said to be delayed. China's antitrust regulatory hasn't started its formal review of the deal for Softbank to sell Arm to Nvidia, according to a report from The Information.",0,0.556,1.0,NEGATIVE
