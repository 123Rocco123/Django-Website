,"SHANGHAI, Aug 3 (Reuters) - China's regulatory agency is launching an investigation into chip distributors in the auto industry, citing suspicions of price gouging, it said on Tuesday. The action by the State Administration For Market Regulation (SAMR) is the latest in a regulatory crackdown following a range of companies and industries targeted over the past year as the Chinese government clamps down on industry. ""In response to prominent problems such as speculation and high prices in the automotive chip market, the State Administration of Market Supervision has recently filed an investigation on car chip distributors,"" the agency said. The firms were suspected of driving up prices, based on price monitoring and reporting clues, it added in its statement, and vowed to investigate and punish illegal acts such as hoarding, price-gouging and collusion. A global shortage of chips that began last December has disrupted supply chains and the hardware sector worldwide. Though initially concentrated in the automotive sector, it has since spread to affect a wide range of gadgets. Panic about supply uncertainty has occasionally led chip buyers and distributors to purchase more chips than they need, creating a vicious cycle that further drives up prices. In June, the chief executive of chipmaker Intel said he expected the shortage to hit bottom by year-end, with the market retuning to normalcy only by 2023. In April China's regulator imposed a record fine of $2.75 billion on e-commerce giant Alibaba for engaging in anti-competitive practices. https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-regulator-investigate-auto-chip-distributors-suspicion-price-gouging-2021-08-03/ Ok, this is getting a bit out of hand. A constant barrage of bearish news coming out of China after some stabilizing that happened at the end of last week. Not sure what the endgame here is for China or the CCP. On one hand, it makes no sense for them to lose the confidence of foreign investors with moves like this. Are they pushing the boundaries of patience of investors? Or is this a deliberate attempt to crackdown on each sector one by one? Stocks likely to be affected by this: AMD, INTC, QCOM, NVDA and consequently TSLA, NIO, LI, XPEV, BYD.

On one hand, it makes no sense for them to lose the confidence of foreign investors with moves like this. Are they pushing the boundaries of patience of investors? Or is this a deliberate attempt to crackdown on each sector one by one?I get what you mean. It looks like China looks at their capital markets and investors differently than the US. In the US there is a tonne of attention and news relating to the stock market/investors and such. Any decision made by the government or the Fed, the news looks at the news to see what ""the market"" thinks of the decision. It wouldn't surprise me if it influences decisions made by policy makers. I remember Donald Trump as President would refer to the stock market a lot, saying it's reach ATH at some point under his tenure.In China, the CCP seem to not give a heck about the stock market. As in, if their decisions hurt the stock market. They care about the social and political areas more. Assuming they're doing things by the book, it's not really a bad thing because with BABA, and Tencent, they went after monopolistic practices regarding letting customers pay with the competitors payment service. The $2.5B fine on Alibaba last year was for monopolistic practices that hurt merchants such as, forcing them to sell exclusively on one platform. The Private Tutoring companies that were hurt badly last week was to reduce costs for students. They went after Didi because of data protection issues, I believe (correct me if I'm wrong).Other than the Private Tutoring companies, these don't seem so unfair, assuming these fines were made fairly and ""by the book"". I can't imagine the US hitting their big companies so quickly and easily for these monopolistic practices. Really, it would be years of court dates, then a small fine.It's interesting to see 2 superpowers approaching tech companies so differently. Will be interesting to see how this proceeds.",0,0.543,1.0,NEGATIVE
