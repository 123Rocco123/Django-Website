I recall reading about Discovery (DISCA) that their product is 'scalable through time and space' and I could not help but thinking that people 50 years from now will still enjoy nature movies that were made today.Another intangible asset that is likely at the root of US tech success is the ability to attract the best workforce and use their creativity to come up with all sorts of awesome products that are now ubiquitous money machines.The pandemic taught me how fragile tangible assets like office real estate are.",0,0.522,0.934,POSITIVE

In streaming terms this depends largely on measurable investments that are cash generating, and cash is a tangible, fungible asset. This notion that you cannot value companies based on tangible assets is rooted in a broad lack of understanding of accounting. At the end of the day, what the investor is concerned with is the company's efficiency at generating operating cash growth, and the signs of that are not ephemeral and unknowable, they are measurable and documented in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.This doesn't mean that we stay away from streaming companies... it means that the valuation of them is not based on ""kinda sorta maybes"" but very tangible numbers around their subscription revenues and segment growth. In this regard we know exactly what we should pay for DISCA and it's not as attractively priced as some other media companies with significant presence in SVOD.",1,0.531,0.999,NEGATIVE

There's no reason we cannot observe the efficiency with which they convert IP to operating cash by thorough analysis of their historical financials.What do I care, as an investor, about the IP they never converted to operating cash?I'm not talking about PPE from a liquidation perspective. There's so much more in the financial statements than fixed assets... It's not how many gold toilets there are in the executive washroom that interests me. It's their rate of return on capital and their weighted cost of capital that interests me insofar as the DCF analysis of their projected and terminal cashflows are concerned.But if there's something you know about flaws in DCF that every investment bank on Earth has wrong, please reach out to them and let us know the outcome of that conversation.

In a bit of a tangential but related story, the reason Jimmy Carter didn’t take the US to the metric system in the late 70s - we came very close - was because it was cost-prohibitive to change the machines that made the other machines. When you have a giant steel foundry and fabrication facility that makes propeller shafts and screws for warships or turbines for hydroelectric dams, it’s not easy to change from the English system to metric on huge machines with mil-spec tolerances. Same thing with aerospace. The machines that make satellites or launch vehicle rocket nozzles are pretty hard to replicate cheaply, for example. Those companies were valuable and it was too expensive to put that financial burden on those that build industrial machinery and infrastructure.If you own the things that make other things and you can do it well at a profit, repeatedly over time with minimal variance, you are in a pretty solid position.",2,0.521,0.996,POSITIVE

Ones that are differentiated enough that you don't have to compete on price. Whatever you do, if you do it right people will pay anything. See Kanye West and iPhones.Where are the opportunities for growth now? I would say in the developing world, mostly. China shows what can be done in 10-20 years and other low income countries want some of it.

You are thinking like an investor, so you are looking for companies that charge an obscene markup for a product and have lots of demand, but hasn't been overbought yet. These will be in the services industry, such as software, or the products industry, such as mainstream luxury goods (iphone is such an example).But if we're talking true productivity and true economic growth, then we're talking anywhere that is getting massively automated or changed, but still competes on price, such that those obscene profits are competed away, giving the biggest economic gain. These would be:The energy industry (renewable or otherwise)Transportation industryHome appliances industryOpen source software (continues to drive huge economic wins around the world)Computing in general (every 5 years, it's about 20-30% faster for the same cost)Even medical (though medical has high barriers to competition still, the industry is scared that may be changing and that eventually medical becomes a compete on price and quality, both things they say are very scary, haha)",0,0.53,0.999,NEGATIVE
