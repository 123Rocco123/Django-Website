He stopped being the technology officer just a few years before they really started losing market share. He's now the CEO and focusing on improving production and product quality and they're already putting more money into those in his first few months in charge.More cash on hand than AMD has done in revenue their last 3 years combined, so they have plenty of money to put into improving product and production quality.New facilities within the U.S. is also good given the current party in office and our horrible supply chain.

Until that issue is solved, either by some new architecture or some mitigating response, I don't think Intel will make a comeback to where it was.Nevertheless, I do think the security flaws will be appropriately addressed in the future. Thus, I bought-in at 50/share and holding tight. My guess is probably within 10 years there should be a nice return (maybe a 10 bagger). How so?Just before the March 2018 announcement, Intel was on a rally. What if that had continued? To date, that may have possibly meant 100/share, though it's hard to tell if inflation would have affected this. The price then was about 50 bucks, which is where I bought in. Even if I'm wrong, I should at least be able to get my money back, though, again, I won't be making that decision for years until the miracle announcement comes for the security improvement (or doesn't after 10 or so years).It's also possible that more damaging flaws will be discovered (actually, that's probably guaranteed), and/or big consumers like Microsoft Azure will start to lose confidence and start replacing Intel with AMD. I don't see the former being too impactful. I mean, meltdown and spectre are hard to beat. The latter I'm not worried about either because, as is the case with Microsoft, what's the real benefit of moving to AMD at this point? That would be a whole lot of hardware to replace, and for what? Though AMD isn't particularly impacted by the newer spectre attacks, it is still certainly impacted by these ""type"" of flaws, and again, susceptible to future flaws and loss in customer faith (for performance). So, it would be a risky and huge bet which I don't think Microsoft (for example) will make.Based on these reasons, I think Intel is a good long-term play. Now's the time to buy, and cross your fingers that the major market correction to come doesn't impact Intel ""too much"", or you may be waiting decades to get your money back.EditEven with a market correction/crash, I don't think the share price will be impacted much with that beautiful P/E of 12.82.
