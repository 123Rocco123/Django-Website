,"I have seen some of the better known companies being marked as 1 star by morning star. Companies like apple, amd, Nvidia, paypal , Amazon, Tesla, Alibaba, Netflix, Google being all below 3 star. What gauging mechanism is being used there ? I have noticed some traditional companies in food, beverage industries and retails companies enjoy higher star in general. Specially the companies that pay dividends have higher rating. Is there any correlation?","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

Is there any correlation?",It's just based on where the price is relative to Morningstar's determination of fair value.A company they view as heavily overvalued will be one star; a company they view as heavily undervalued will be five stars.It says nothing about the underlying business model or long-term prospects.,0,0.594,1.0,NEGATIVE

Generally speaking, stocks trading at large discounts to our analysts' fair value estimates will receive higher (4 or 5) star ratings, and stocks trading at large premiums to their fair value estimates will receive lower (1 or 2) star ratings. Stocks that are trading very close to our analysts' fair value estimates will receive 3-star ratings.How does the methodology for the Morningstar Rating for stocks differ from the methodology for the Morningstar Rating for funds?Funds and stocks are different investment vehicles and therefore should be analyzed—and rated—differently. The Morningstar Rating for funds describes how well a fund has balanced return and risk or volatility in the past. The Morningstar Rating for stocks uses projections of a company's future operating performance to estimate whether the stock is overvalued or undervalued.Evaluating an individual security requires a different approach than sizing up a portfolio of stocks; our ratings for stocks and funds are designed to do two different things.When evaluating a mutual fund, an investor is essentially judging the past performance of a portfolio manager, the fund company, the cost structure, and the investment strategy to determine if the fund deserves a place in his or her portfolio. Our rating for funds is a backward-looking description of how the fund has balanced return and risk or volatility in the past, and it is a useful tool for paring down an immense universe of mutual funds.When evaluating an individual stock, you need to estimate future cash flows and earnings. The Morningstar Rating for stocks is designed to tell investors if a stock's current price is greater than or less than our estimate of the stock's fair value, based on the potential future earnings and performance of the company. While historical performance is given consideration when our analysts make their estimates, the Morningstar Rating for stocks is forward-looking.The Morningstar Rating for funds:Is a descriptive, backward-looking measure of historical performanceIs strictly quantitative--there is no analyst input or opinionCombines return and risk (volatility)Is calculated once per monthCompares funds to their peers in specific investment categoriesHas a fixed distribution of stars--10% of funds within each category receive 5 stars, 22.5% receive 4 stars, 35% receive 3 stars, 22.5% receive 2 stars, and 10% receive 1 starThe Morningstar Rating for stocks:Is a measure of whether or not the stock is over- or undervalued based on forward-looking estimatesIs risk adjustedIs based on both quantitative and subjective inputs—it includes analysts' opinions, which are embedded in their estimates of future cash flowsIs calculated dailyDoes not divide stocks into comparison groups, nor does it have a fixed distribution of stars—the percentage of stocks receiving 5 stars will fluctuate dailyAlthough we use different methodologies, both result in a meaningful, independent rating that is easily understood.",0,0.536,0.999,NEGATIVE
