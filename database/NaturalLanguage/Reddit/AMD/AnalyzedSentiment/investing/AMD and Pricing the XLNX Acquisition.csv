,"Conclusions: Current fair market price for AMD, if we fold in XLNX's outstanding shares worth $35bn, is $101.14/share. AMD will be trading at no less than $150/share by spring 2023, representing 24% gain per year for 2.5 years. (Personally I'm putting it at $175, or 31.6%/yr for 30 months.) ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Key assumptions that are by no means a done deal:  They will complete the deal as planned by the end of 2021, meaning they will meet unspecified pre-conditions and receive regulator approval The all-stock purchase will be completed for the stated price of $35 billion.  If those assumptions hold true, then the following is also true:  The current fair market value for AMD stock, if XLNX's current market cap and outstanding shares are folded into the mix, is $100.96/share, based on the 7 Jan closing price, or $101.14 based on the year-end $35 billion purchase price. The latter represents a 6.33% increase over the 7 January 2021 AMD closing price of $95.16/share. This is only based on up-to-date market cap figures and most-recent-quarter earnings figures, which are a good three months out of date at this point.  Additionally, in the press releases and earnings calls where the CEOs discussed the merger, one of the points that came out was that the companies have a lot of overlap when it comes to their business operations and R&D. Within 18 months of the merger, or late spring 2023, that means they will be able to cut $300 million in annual expenses, simply through synergy of eliminating functional overlap. Given the following from the most recent quarterly reports, covering 3 months of operations ending 26 Sep 2020:  XLNX net earnings were $193.8m, or $775.2m annualized AMD net earnings were $390m, or $1.56b annualized Combined earnings are $2.33b That means that net earnings will be increased by 13%, just in cutting overlapping expenses. That means that, assuming today's earnings and today's share prices, and combining the financials of both companies, the fair market value for AMD as of early- to mid-2023 is $114, based on annualized earnings numbers that are already three months old.  Using conservative extrapolation of recent growth trajectories, and using today's price multiples*, it's conservative to estimate that AMD will be trading for $150/share by June 2023. Based on the current share price of 95.12, that's an annualized growth of 23.96%.  *If for whatever reason there's a market downturn in this time, AMD's performance could live up to these numbers, but the price multiples could decrease. This represents nearly all remaining risk of inaccuracy, outside the stated assumptions. Please fire away at this. Poke your holes and make your arguments. I'm getting ready to heavily shift my portfolio's center of gravity into AMD based on all this, so if any of you know a good reason not to, I'd love to hear it.","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

Looking at the short term, this stock has managed to avoid drawing too much hype in 2020 despite having some extremely cool stuff in the pipeline. If they manage to roll out a plan towards competitive ARM and 5nm chips in sufficient volume I think this stock would experience some absolutely massive valuation expansion.But honestly, the reason I'm considering buying this company is because the market literally can't get enough processors. All AMD needs to do to massively increase sales is pump out as many processors as they can and the market will eat it up. That's a hell of a position to be in when the market is being saturated with ridiculous companies worth similar valuations with garbage sales and non-existent moats. It's a more aggressive ""Microsoft-style"" play where it's the future but it's proven it can actually execute, I like that a lot.There's a lot of short-term catalysts too between CES on the 12th and earnings near the end of the month. I think I'll buy 200 shares on margin next Monday and sell some Jan 29 ~110 calls against it as a safety.",0,0.561,0.983,POSITIVE
