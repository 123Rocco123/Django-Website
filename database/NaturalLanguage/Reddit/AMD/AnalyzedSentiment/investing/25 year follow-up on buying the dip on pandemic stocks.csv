,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year. In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI. Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below. Previous updates: 1 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks 1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks 2 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks Progress updates Below are the returns for this portfolio (opened in 2022) as of December 2024.

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects. In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off. To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change. Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation. Unrealized (current investments) Meta (META): +367.97% Nvidia (NVDA): +117.05% Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up ~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months. These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Rate of return (IRR) My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is 73.6%. Investment thesis See a summary of my investment thesis in a previous update. TL;DR: “…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways. The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among other things.” - 1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks, Nov. 2023 Nvidia's dominance I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations: Nvidia is founder-led and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before. Final thoughts I'm still well within the 'maybe I'm just lucky' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of my last update I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from. I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025. UPDATE: Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024).

The 'ChatGPT moment' when AI entered the public consciousness and investment meaningfully increased was ~2 years ago.Given past technological advancements, do we think we're near the end of what possible after two years or the beginning?That's where I'd start. Working in the industry, talking to folks and watching what others are building reinforces this. For example, just about every scientist and research I've talking to is excited because we're just scratching the surface of what's possible.For consumer examples, look at the videos Sora is creating (I recently got access to it). It has a long way to go, but I can imagine the possibilities. For example, imagine coming home and wanting to watch a new sequel of <your favorite franchise here>, but on a different timeline/scenario and just asking AI to generate it. How much would you pay for that? What about for a custom, fully immersive VR video game?And that's just the world of bits. Move to the world of atoms and imagine robots trained to fix/build anything and do anything around the home, to train you how to improve your swing, etc. What if you could learn anything with a dedicated tutor? That's all possible with AI. How much economic value is that in the US and around the world?I use it multiple times a day, every day. It's great, but still has a lot to improve on even in the scope of daily life. But as it becomes better, faster and cheaper it'll increase by orders of magnitude in usefulness.",1,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.599

Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways. The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade.

It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

Still bigger than GCP and Azure I think, though I believe Azure might be seeing more AI demand due to OpenAI? Either way, you have an incredible vantage point on the industry.This might be true, but o1 has shown us new opportunities for scaling. We still may also see improvements to pre-training with more scale, synthetic data, etc. but I'm not holding my breath for that. However, I do expect improvements with efficiency and optimization of models. Suffice to say that scaling compute isn't the only way to improve.I'm also excited because I believe we've barely scratched the surface of where we can even implement the current state of AI into the existing economy. E.g. let's assume AI models don't improve at all, there's still 5+ years of progress we could make by efficiently implementing what we have today -- especially as more people get better at understanding how to use it. Though this would shift the focus to inference from training and have implications, but I'm still optimistic.In a nutshell given that AI is effectively intelligence, my core assumption is that we're more likely to underestimate the impact than overestimate it -- especially given Nvidia's still reasonable P/E ratio (51 as of right now) with supply constraints.We shall see.

If you go watch Sora, you'll see it understands some things, like lighting and shadows some physical processes, but then not others... Yet. Just like you can generate an agent from a powerful LLM, you will soon be able to do the same with video gen, but it will actually have a physical understanding of the world.We would then be ~2/3 of the way to a fully autonomous talking humanoid robot. The other third being integrating these 2 + physical control mechanism into one model.https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bSwdbhMP9oAWzeqsG/openai-s-sora-is-an-agentI can't guarantee AI won't go down, but you can be sure it will go higher than it is now within the decade, barring bad black swan events.",4,0.514,POSITIVE,0.831

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks.

TL;DR: “…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways. The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among other things.” - 1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks, Nov. 2023 Nvidia's dominance I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations: Nvidia is founder-led and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before. Final thoughts I'm still well within the 'maybe I'm just lucky' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of my last update I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from. I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025. UPDATE: Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were ~24% and ~16%.","If you truly believe that the transformer is only to be applied to customer service chatbots and coding copilots then you sincerely lack imagination.Look at Waymo, look at Tesla, look at Recursion Pharmaceuticals, look at Palantir, look at BigBear, look at RedCat. There are hundreds of examples of current explorations of AI beyond just being a chatbot.This is just the beginning. The real boon here will be the spilling over of AI into other domains and those unrealized gains are undetermined and difficult to predict, but it’s already begun and I expect it to continue. Very few people beyond research scientists give a shit about the benchmarks everyone harps over. The most important part IMO is how will AI be applied in non-technological domains.",3,0.524,NEGATIVE,0.95

The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among other things.” - 1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks, Nov. 2023 Nvidia's dominance I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations: Nvidia is founder-led and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

Is it all just code generation and emails?As a non-programmer engineer I just can't find a use case for it, and I've tried. The best use I've found is when I occasionally want to write some simple automation it'll give me the structure and syntax in Python or whatever so I didn't have to look up a bunch of reference docs, but that's about it.I can't trust it for search because it gives bad or incorrect information often enough I have to verify sources and end up just reading the human written information. I can't use it for design because my field is too niche and proprietary, there's not enough public data for the public AIs to train on. And my company is not going to pay me to essentially switch careers into software engineering to spend a few years learning how to deploy an in house AI. Even then I struggle to imagine how it would make my work easier or faster, I'd still have to sit there verifying everything it came up with. I don't even want it to write my emails, they all come out very... AI styled. It's obvious I didn't write them.",2,0.526,NEGATIVE,1.0

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off. To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations.

Unrealized (current investments) Meta (META): +367.97% Nvidia (NVDA): +117.05% Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up ~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months. These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Rate of return (IRR) My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is 73.6%. Investment thesis See a summary of my investment thesis in a previous update. TL;DR: “…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways. The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among other things.” - 1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks, Nov. 2023 Nvidia's dominance I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations: Nvidia is founder-led and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before. Final thoughts I'm still well within the 'maybe I'm just lucky' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of my last update I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from. I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among other things.” - 1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks, Nov. 2023 Nvidia's dominance I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations: Nvidia is founder-led and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade.

It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).

The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among other things.” - 1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks, Nov. 2023 Nvidia's dominance I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations: Nvidia is founder-led and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before. Final thoughts I'm still well within the 'maybe I'm just lucky' phase since it's only been a couple years.

The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among other things.” - 1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks, Nov. 2023 Nvidia's dominance I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations: Nvidia is founder-led and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before. Final thoughts I'm still well within the 'maybe I'm just lucky' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of my last update I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from. I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

Rate of return (IRR) My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is 73.6%. Investment thesis See a summary of my investment thesis in a previous update. TL;DR: “…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways. The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among other things.” - 1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks, Nov. 2023 Nvidia's dominance I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations: Nvidia is founder-led and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before. Final thoughts I'm still well within the 'maybe I'm just lucky' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of my last update I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from. I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

But some examples of things that'd change my mind about the future (and would prompt an underwear change 💩😆):Nvidia: They are no longer supply constrained, particularly if it's due to something pointing to permanently reduced demand like significantly limited returns from GPU scaling.Meta: They stop seeing returns from implementing AI in ads and see an extended period of reduced or stagnant impression growth resulting in increasingly higher ad prices (counterintuitive, but points to limited future opportunities). Another one might be Apple launching a new wearable that's comparable to Meta's Orion, which points to Apple owning the next platform paradigm, like they did with the iPhone. Another might be some regulation around AI that outlaws their Llama model.It could be a number of things, but more broadly anything that meaningfully points to AI not being the meaningful trend I think it is. That's not to say there won't be bubbles, busts or that Nvidia/Meta won't have meaningful short-term corrections, but that happens -- I've been investing long enough to be comfortable with those.What are you buying today?Today I actually bought a small amount of SMCI again since they dropped due to the Nasdaq delisting and are still depressed from issues due to their reporting.But it’s risky since things still seem fishy and it’s more akin to gambling than I’m typically comfortable with, so I only purchased small amount.I decided to take a chance since their sales still seem strong, but doubt I’ll hold it long term since it’s not a high conviction bet for me, I'm just playing the short-term volatility after watching it for months.I don't have any plans to buy anything else, but I rarely do. I mostly just trade based on whenever I get new information or valuations change enough to buy/sell, which is unpredictable. I generally don't trade very often, so buying SMCI to hold short-term is unusual for me.",3,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0

This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before. Final thoughts I'm still well within the 'maybe I'm just lucky' phase since it's only been a couple years.

The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways. The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among other things.” - 1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks, Nov. 2023 Nvidia's dominance I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations: Nvidia is founder-led and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before. Final thoughts I'm still well within the 'maybe I'm just lucky' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of my last update I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from. I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025. UPDATE: Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024).

,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year. In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI. Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

Amazon for example now has their Trainum 2 chips in GA promising better price performance, whith Trainium 3 chips coming next summer. This will cut into Nvidia's market share at the low end, as AWS' goal is always to commoditize infra. Google also has its own TPUs it uses.But they and all other hyperscalers still use Nvidia's GPUs as well due to the unmatched versatility and ecosystem. Where the balance settles is still a big question.The more negative case for Nvidia is if somehow we reach the limits GPU scaling on all fronts (e.g. even o1's economics don't scale, which is unlikely), in which case GPUs become more commoditized to the extent that the other aspects of their moat (CUDA, ecosystem, networking, etc.) can't make up for it.However, I don't think that is the case. I'm also curious how large sovereign AI becomes in the coming years.Long-term I'd expect Nvidia's market share to settle around ~70% (from ~90% today for datacenter AI GPUs). But even if competitors catch up and it drops to 50% I believe the market will be massive enough to achieve attractive returns.",1,0.544,NEGATIVE,0.999

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects. In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off. To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change. Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation. Unrealized (current investments) Meta (META): +367.97% Nvidia (NVDA): +117.05% Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up ~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months. These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Rate of return (IRR) My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is 73.6%. Investment thesis See a summary of my investment thesis in a previous update. TL;DR: “…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways. The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among other things.” - 1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks, Nov. 2023 Nvidia's dominance I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations: Nvidia is founder-led and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before. Final thoughts I'm still well within the 'maybe I'm just lucky' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of my last update I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from. I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025. UPDATE: Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024).

It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).

The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways. The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among other things.” - 1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks, Nov. 2023 Nvidia's dominance I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations: Nvidia is founder-led and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before. Final thoughts I'm still well within the 'maybe I'm just lucky' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of my last update I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from. I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year. In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI. Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

TL;DR: “…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways. The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among other things.” - 1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks, Nov. 2023 Nvidia's dominance I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations: Nvidia is founder-led and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before. Final thoughts I'm still well within the 'maybe I'm just lucky' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of my last update I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from. I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.
