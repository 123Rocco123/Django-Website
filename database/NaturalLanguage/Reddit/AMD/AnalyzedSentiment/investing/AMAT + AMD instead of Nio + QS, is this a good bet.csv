Either that or the folks who bought Intel solely for it's dividends.If they had done any level or amount of research into the products that these companies were releasing at the time along with how the enthusiast public market opinions were leaning; then they'd have a fairly good predication for an AMD breakout in the years coming.In essence, Intel and AMD has an easy to predict cyclical stock cycle due to them actually being in fairly good competition between one another.

However for me at a p/e of 9 for intel i think the downside is low if you hold for a couple of years.If intel has a bit of growth the P/E might pop back to 18 and you have a 100 percent return from here.Just like microsoft was not a dying company in 2013, i dont think that intel is a dying company now.Worst case scenario is you get a yeild of 12 percent if revenues remain stable.This all depends on their lineup.

Overall, I am quite bullish on AMAT and AMD and they have the necessary growth to provide good returns in longer term. The question is, what's the outlook for NIO and QS? I will admit that I bought these on speculations and have been holding them for about 9-10 months. Are they expected to turn around over next few months or would moving my money to AMAT + AMD be a better option?",Stop trying to pick home runs and starting actually investing...NIO and QS are just gambling stocks.AMD is better but who knows if it is at highs right now.My advice is to just buy funds like VTI and stop trying to gamble on a few companies.,0,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE

If you believe in all of them then buy positions in all four. When I started: i can’t tell you how many times I left positions, only to see them do well 6-12 months later. If you believe in them, stay patient and wait.My best example this year was Hut8. Did my DD, bought in for a about 3 euros per share. Bitcoin crashed down and was surrounded by negative news. I sold and now it’s 13. I also panicked and sold my crypto.",0,0.551,1.0,NEGATIVE
