,"My portfiolio is mainly low cost index funds but i want to allocate around 20% of my portfiolio to some individual stocks i've chosen a few already: apple, microsoft, alphabet class A, amazon, meta, amd, nvidia, pepsico, J&J, home depot, amex, JPM chase, and abbvie obviously these companies have different growth potentials and already have variation in individual stock price as well as previous growth. How would you go about deciding how much to invest in each one?","Depends on your investment style. Value investors, growth investors, momentum investors, etc all have different ways in which they’d tell you to allocate.Here’s the deal: those are all very stable picks apart from AMD which is a little more high risk high reward. Maybe a little too much tech but you’ll be fine long term.If you’re just passively throwing money in, buy those stocks and DCA for a long time until you maybe decide to sell.Those stocks won’t make you rich and won’t make you poor. Idk a ton about most of them specifically but it really isn’t that high risk.",0,0.538,NEGATIVE,0.952

How would you go about deciding how much to invest in each one?","""Back in my day"" (~25 years ago) when I set up my first portfolio it looked similar. Mostly tech stocks with some individual stocks in other sectors to try and balance out the tech (financials, tobacco, consumer products, etc.). I did a roughly even split across all of them. Unsurprisingly big tech crushed everything in the long term. Those stocks, btw, are likely well-represented in your ETFs depending on how they're allocated internally so one thing to consider would be a smaller slice of your portfolio (say 10%) for higher volatility plays in less-common stocks. On the flipside, instead of chasing more volatility you could also invest in a different type of asset (just as a random example REITs) to bolster diversification and not be solely riding the equity market.",0,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.999

You seem to have a good mindset.This really comes down to your comfort level and your style as an investor. More than how much of each one unto the other individual stocks you are considering, I would consider more the weight (%) you want of each holding. For myself, in my two portfolios, both with over 50 holdings in each, a standard weight for each position is between 1% and 3.5% depending on whether it is a full holding or a building holding. Also into that comes how I feel about the valuation and maturity of the company. I have some more speculative positions that I may keep well under 1%.I have ""best idea"" stocks, usually limited to only 1 or 2 that can be over 4%, sometimes as high as 6-7%. When that occurs however, they usually will be trimmed back a bit.The main thing I try to educate people on, especially if new to the markets, is not to be in a hurry to build your positions. Determine the top weight you want to have in the name, and then break your purchases up into 3-5, or more, smaller purchases over a period of a couple months. Personally, I don't like establishing a full position all in one EPS quarter .. I like to span a quarter or two so I can gain comfort with a company. I also often don't take the last position, instead waiting for some market event that I can take advantage of. it could be a big down day in the market, a poor earnings report, etc. As long as nothing has changed too materially ... I'll add another leg on extreme weakness. This has worked really well over the decades.So, it's all about weighting to maintain a healthy risk exposure that doesn't interrupt your sleep.Good luck, hope that helps a little.

How would you go about deciding how much to invest in each one?","Your own level of risk tolerance is huge in the decisioning but when it comes to purchasing individual stocks, my recommendation is to determine the ultimate % weight you desire for each position, I usually recommend no more than 3.5% or each. So, if you had a $10,000 account, then a full weight for an individual stock could be $350. Of course, this amount could be variable depending on tolerance, overweighting and the % will move as the stock moves. I typically begin trimming stocks if they reach 4.5% unless they are one of my ""best idea"" stocks, which I will only have 1-2 of those at a time.As a general rule I always recommend building positions over a period of time, not all at once. So determine your ultimate weight for a stock position and then scale into that position over a period of weeks/months via 3-5 individual trades, preferably spanning at least one earnings report.Hope that helpsTJhttps://www.reddit.com/r/InnerCircleInvesting/",0,0.546,NEGATIVE,0.517
