,"I’m new to these stock things and I put in some money on Robinhood. I’ve only traded with stocks of tsla, aapl and amd, so please tell me if what I’m doing on Robinhood is wrong or if it’s the wrong way to do it. I’m scared of options so please don’t even suggest it as of yet. This is what I do: I buy a stock, see it go up 3% and then sell it because I’m happy that now my $100 is $103. Then I see that it drops another x% and then let’s say that stock drops to $101. Then I buy again at that $101 and sell it when it goes to $102 as I’m yet again happy with the $1 I gained. Doing this for quite a few months my all time high on Robinhood shows 33% increase. I like to do this with all my money at the same time and yes there are times when my all time gain decreases to 25% or something but with similar strategy I bring it back up. Is this the wrong way to do it? I’m happy with these tiny gains but are there some negatives to it that I should be aware of? Just keep in mind that I don’t buy and sell on the same day to not be marked as a day trader on Robinhood. So if I buy today I will sell no earlier than tomorrow be it a profit or loss.

Thank you in advance for sharing your ideas with this noob here.",You won't pay lots of taxes. You will have to pay taxes on your Short Term Gains at your current income tax rate which may not be very much depending on what it is. This only applys if the money isn't in retirement account where the gains aren't taxed regardless until withdrawal.I personally like swing trading and do it myself. Depends on how the market is behaving. Some stocks like AMZN and NVDA are fairly consistent in going up so I pretty much just hold long term. Others like Fastly and other that are more volatile you may want to buy on a down swing and sell on the up as it can vary 5%+ daily.Do what works for you. Buying and holding long term is not the only way to invest regardless what they say. Trading is investing just with a shorter time horizon. I feel like people that consistently buy and sell are more reactively to downswings and less likely to ride it down and wait for it to recover.,0,0.526,0.701,POSITIVE

,"I’m new to these stock things and I put in some money on Robinhood. I’ve only traded with stocks of tsla, aapl and amd, so please tell me if what I’m doing on Robinhood is wrong or if it’s the wrong way to do it. I’m scared of options so please don’t even suggest it as of yet. This is what I do: I buy a stock, see it go up 3% and then sell it because I’m happy that now my $100 is $103. Then I see that it drops another x% and then let’s say that stock drops to $101. Then I buy again at that $101 and sell it when it goes to $102 as I’m yet again happy with the $1 I gained. Doing this for quite a few months my all time high on Robinhood shows 33% increase. I like to do this with all my money at the same time and yes there are times when my all time gain decreases to 25% or something but with similar strategy I bring it back up. Is this the wrong way to do it? I’m happy with these tiny gains but are there some negatives to it that I should be aware of? Just keep in mind that I don’t buy and sell on the same day to not be marked as a day trader on Robinhood. So if I buy today I will sell no earlier than tomorrow be it a profit or loss. Thank you in advance for sharing your ideas with this noob here.","The issue is I don’t know if I’m buying low and selling high. I just buy the slight dips and I guess I’ve gotten lucky so far? I was hit a bit bad like right after apples stock split for example when it tanked 15% of my portfolio value. And for Tesla gains, I’ve missed plenty.",1,0.53,0.943,NEGATIVE
