Buying similar companies that dominate a niche means you mostly just care about the niche, and don't have to worry that AMD passes NVDA someday or SNPS takes 80% of their niche. You'll do fine either way.Likewise, AMAT, ASML, KLAC, LRCX are the main semiconductor equipment companies. Owning these four is basically a longterm sure thing until some other company comes along and threatens the stranglehold these four have on their niche.
