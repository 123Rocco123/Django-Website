,"All, Considering ongoing macro economic and geo political issues, which tech stock would you actually buy or consider buying in next days? Low cap + high growth stocks will be almost out of question. High interest rates and recession worries will put a strain on borrowing and high spend on customer acquisitions. Mid - high cap on B2C side will suffer as well. This will put strain on companies like Apple since people would delay upgrading their devices. Companies such as AMD, qualcomm, intel with significant B2C exposure will also suffer. Netflix is already getting hammered. Mid-high cap B2B. Relatively these companies should be in much better position. Companies are not going to stop using Microsoft products or discontinue the aws cloud or stop spending on Google advertisment. Sure, their growth rates will suffer but it's hard to think that their existing hold over market will be affected. I'm thinking of readjusting my portfolio and would appreciate your inputs. Generally, I'm a fan of the tech sector from a long term perspective and would still invest in it at current conditions. I would still stick to active investing rather than ETFs since i assume accrual returns on ETFs would also be much lower.",Google is a rly easy pick for this one It’s a little pricey but srsly look at how integrated they are into so many aspects of the internet. You can get more exotic and adventurous of course w tech stocks but at this point Google is a safe solid massive company w so much goin on I can’t see how they don’t grow and prolly split at some point,0,0.533,0.612,NEGATIVE
