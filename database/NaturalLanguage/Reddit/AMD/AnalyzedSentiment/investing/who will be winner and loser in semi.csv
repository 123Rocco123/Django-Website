ASML will be subject to very little geopolitical risk and is basically a monopoly for european market. INTC is reasonably priced but i think it’s a value trap. another possible catalyst is the CHIPS act may give them a boost. TSM. fall 32% since beginning of year. Both Samsung and TSMC have 3-nm technology. it also expects to produce 2-nm in 2023. dividend yield is 2.1%. more importantly TSM owns 50% of the market and 85% of the high end. AMD - Intel’s loss of market share is AMD’s gain. higher end chip seems to be in demand really strong. biggest threat to all is the potential oversupply of chips due to government intervention.","Biggest growth I reckon is two things.Small / old fabs: booming industry for old fab reselling for thing like auto market / IoT. Fab liquidators are doing hella business rn in 60nm+ 6-8” fabs. Selling lot hot cakes.Silicon Carbide: unique properties as a dielectric substrate and one with great optical properties (AR and the like). Currently limited to small wafers due to immense difficulty scaling crystal growth without defects.Wolfspeed (formally Cree) are building a new facility in NY to try and crack optical grade 8” Crystal growth (I guess, someone tried recruiting me on LinkedIn, suddenly became very coy when I asked about this).The above list are very mature companies with a known (dare I say it, ‘priced in’) gov assisted expansion programs.For established companies with an extremely dominant position, I’d ante up with Tokyo Electron. Base offering of defecto number 1 coater/developer tools that directly integrate with ASML tools, as well as expanding their reach into other processing technologies. (Dry etch, plasma deposition and atomic layer deposition markers). A company of extreme quality focus.AMAT is also doing this, but I honestly scarcely believe they’re in business, as their customer service is god-awful for anyone but mega-fabs. Could cost them long term. They overcharge and abuse the Shit out of mid/small tier fabs and simply trade on name recognition at that level.My only bet on AMAT is their push for IP co-ops driven by these smaller fab partnerships. I would wager they’re tied up with Apple on R&D. But, again, a guess.",0,0.53,0.952,POSITIVE

Back in early 2000s, one or two bad years at the leading edge meant your fabs might never turn a profit. Since most of the industry just moved on and there wasn't that much use for older nodes, and we were spitting out new nodes every other year.Look at TSMC today, 28nm is still chugging and bringing in a lot of revenue. Profit margins may not be sky high outside of the pandemic madness. But unlike in the past, old nodes are not pushed to the wayside and most capacity converted/dismantled after a few years like in the past.All these fabs they are getting subsidies for may not turn into cash cows and golden tickets immediately if there is oversupply. But the capacity will find uses and customers, over time they will make money from them since the time horizon to do so has drastically changed over the past decades.Intel I'm the least worried about when it comes to overcapacity. That just gives them the option to lower margins and offer more silicon/$ to fight AMD.",1,0.542,0.983,NEGATIVE
