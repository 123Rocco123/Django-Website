,"All signs seem to point to INTC divesting it's fabs like AMD did with GloFo. What was once Intel's greatest strength has now becomes it's greatest liability in terms of the fabrication There is supposedly some announcement coming in January, and I'm wondering if this is it. I can't get a feel on how should play it. I would not invest in INTC ""long term"" as I think the company as a whole (fab + design engineering) is far from saving at this point, so was wanting to do a ""short term"" play.","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

And these fabs are fully equipped for Intel's process. Which is now very obviously not at all competitive. This is what happens when you have a bean counter run the company who can't keep the necessary engineering talent.,1,0.563,0.963,NEGATIVE

That would make a lot of sense but there is still more upside in INTC regardless and their mobileye division I would think is a great candidate to spinoff.

How does this make sense? They just bought ARM.Intel bought Mobileye for $15B 4 years ago and not much has come of it since then. They don't have a good track record of merging in acquisitions.

Intel might be making less profit then they could, but it is a worthwhile investment. If they split, they will likely suffer setbacks in the short run like AMD and in the long run, they will lose any design or r&d gains to companies contracting to make near clones. Same thing that happens with all Chinese mfg.",0,0.536,0.998,NEGATIVE
