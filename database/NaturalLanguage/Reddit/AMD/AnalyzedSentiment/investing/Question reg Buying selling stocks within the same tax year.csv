,"So I've been buying and selling random stocks like tesla, amd, apple ect. I usually aim for a 10% increase before I sell but is typically done sometimes the same month or 2/3 months but still in the same tax year. Is it worth doing this or is the capital gain tax make it a waste of time? I've made a decent profit from my initial investment but thats not considering the tax im gonna have to pay after this year. Any advice would be much appreciated.","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

This will give you an idea of what you owe.",0,0.572,0.996,NEGATIVE

So you do get to take the loss, but it kinda accumulates until you stay out of the stock for 30 days.",2,0.537,1.0,NEGATIVE
