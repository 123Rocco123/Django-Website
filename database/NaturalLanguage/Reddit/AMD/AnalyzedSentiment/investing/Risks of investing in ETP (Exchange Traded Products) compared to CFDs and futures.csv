,"Update: After reading some articles and examples Daily ETP have Stop-Loss in them unfortunately... This means that long ETP would trigger a SL if the underlying stock drops ~16.6% in a single day. So that's how the ETP originators earn money. Hello Everyone, Why are retail traders not completely ignoring CFD trades and going all in on low priced leveraged ETPs (pennies)? Example is GraniteShares 3x Long AMD Daily ETC (3LAM.L) currently just 2.74$ We all know that chances are AMD will be more valuable in a year compared to now, as the AI hype wouldn't die in a year. There is too much market share to be taken away from Nvidia and the market doesn't even have too - the demand is currently way higher than the supply, so it's only a plus! The issue with futures and CFDs are that you pay fees, have stop loss and need to know very precisely how much and in which direction the market will move between the opening and closing of your position. With ETP you don't care, as you don't have daily fees or stop loss and inflation is your friend, as generally more money will be put into the profitable stocks sooner or later due to rising expenses and thus prices. This ETP has made 20.1% in a day while AMD 5.25% The NVDA equivalent has made from 6$ to 150$ in just a year. Using x5 leverage maybe could provide that return, but at a MASSIVE risk. How likely was it to lose money from NVDA 1 year ago by buying this ETP at just 6$? Similar ETPs for the other tech companies are already trading at far higher ranges than just 2-3$. For some reason this Google ETP 3LAL hasn't reach it's ATH although currently GOOG is trading around ATH. I guess it has to do with when the ETP starts trading on the market or maybe it doesn't monitor stock splits/dillutions. I am wondering who is on the other sides of those ETP trades? You cannot convince me that people are shorting 3LAM while it's at a silly 2.74$ (was around 0.3$ when AMD was 80$) and AMD just recently started it's AI hyped bull run. Sure it already made around 300% in a year, but so did NVDA and AMD started from way lower market cap! I was actually shorting NVDA around 500-600$ range, as I didn't do any due diligence on it's main product behind everything :( - the Tensor A100 and how many orders were for it etc. Please try to give me arguments why 3LAM would be a bad investment to buy and hold for 1 year if AMD - besides AMD getting priced less than 202$ per share? The fees is around 0.3% per trade without any daily fees from what I could tell. Another example is 3LVW if you think Volkswagen will recover (I do) :). It has massive debt, but pays 8% in dividends. Disclaimer - I put have put my money where my mouth is, but I stay open to corrections about my understandings, as I have been proven very wrong recently about AMZN and why it's valued this high. Why is math not working in some cases? Microstrategy did around x10 increase in a single year. The ETP did around 10 000 times increase?! 3LMI went from 0.01$ to 337.71$ - it seems like the starting price is the biggest factor, as this is not just x30 times increase (due to the x3 leverage), but an insane 3 377 000% - good luck for any crypto to beat that! I couldn't find a single ETP in GraniteShares portfolio of products that achieved the opposite - starting from 1-10$ range and going down to 0.00001$ etc.",I'm guessing you are outside the US since you mentioned CFDs.From a leverage and hedging perspective - an ETP may be more inefficient than using the derivative directly. In the US - that's going to be options and listed futures.,0,0.538,0.917,NEGATIVE

Either that or China will destroy any hopes that have left for stock investments coming from abroad and USA especially.

I couldn't find a single ETP in GraniteShares portfolio of products that achieved the opposite - starting from 1-10$ range and going down to 0.00001$ etc.","I couldn't find a single ETP in GraniteShares portfolio of products that achieved the opposite - starting from 1-10$ range and going down to 0.00001$ etc. I do find several trading in the thousands, so someone made millions if he purchased on the pennies.I am highly against picking ETP above 50$ price range however, due to how the GOOG ETP behaved. I want to be shown an example of ETP in the pennies tracking a beaten up stock and still going down while the stock was up.I respect your non leveraged ethics. My best trades were non leveraged and worst ones leveraged. :(",5,0.525,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Update: After reading some articles and examples Daily ETP have Stop-Loss in them unfortunately... This means that long ETP would trigger a SL if the underlying stock drops ~16.6% in a single day. So that's how the ETP originators earn money. Hello Everyone, Why are retail traders not completely ignoring CFD trades and going all in on low priced leveraged ETPs (pennies)? Example is GraniteShares 3x Long AMD Daily ETC (3LAM.L) currently just 2.74$ We all know that chances are AMD will be more valuable in a year compared to now, as the AI hype wouldn't die in a year. There is too much market share to be taken away from Nvidia and the market doesn't even have too - the demand is currently way higher than the supply, so it's only a plus! The issue with futures and CFDs are that you pay fees, have stop loss and need to know very precisely how much and in which direction the market will move between the opening and closing of your position. With ETP you don't care, as you don't have daily fees or stop loss and inflation is your friend, as generally more money will be put into the profitable stocks sooner or later due to rising expenses and thus prices. This ETP has made 20.1% in a day while AMD 5.25% The NVDA equivalent has made from 6$ to 150$ in just a year. Using x5 leverage maybe could provide that return, but at a MASSIVE risk. How likely was it to lose money from NVDA 1 year ago by buying this ETP at just 6$? Similar ETPs for the other tech companies are already trading at far higher ranges than just 2-3$. For some reason this Google ETP 3LAL hasn't reach it's ATH although currently GOOG is trading around ATH. I guess it has to do with when the ETP starts trading on the market or maybe it doesn't monitor stock splits/dillutions. I am wondering who is on the other sides of those ETP trades? You cannot convince me that people are shorting 3LAM while it's at a silly 2.74$ (was around 0.3$ when AMD was 80$) and AMD just recently started it's AI hyped bull run. Sure it already made around 300% in a year, but so did NVDA and AMD started from way lower market cap! I was actually shorting NVDA around 500-600$ range, as I didn't do any due diligence on it's main product behind everything :( - the Tensor A100 and how many orders were for it etc. Please try to give me arguments why 3LAM would be a bad investment to buy and hold for 1 year if AMD - besides AMD getting priced less than 202$ per share? The fees is around 0.3% per trade without any daily fees from what I could tell. Another example is 3LVW if you think Volkswagen will recover (I do) :). It has massive debt, but pays 8% in dividends. Disclaimer - I put have put my money where my mouth is, but I stay open to corrections about my understandings, as I have been proven very wrong recently about AMZN and why it's valued this high. Why is math not working in some cases? Microstrategy did around x10 increase in a single year. The ETP did around 10 000 times increase?! 3LMI went from 0.01$ to 337.71$ - it seems like the starting price is the biggest factor, as this is not just x30 times increase (due to the x3 leverage), but an insane 3 377 000% - good luck for any crypto to beat that! I couldn't find a single ETP in GraniteShares portfolio of products that achieved the opposite - starting from 1-10$ range and going down to 0.00001$ etc.",What is the ETP for BABA?
