,"Recently added AMD and O to my portfolio and wondered what you guys thought about the long term gains. I’m 18, so looking 10+ years on from now. My thought process is that O will go up as interest rates are high right now so will likely only come down. And for AMD since they are an AI based company, with the rapid expansion of AI over this next decade it will rise along with it. Also as a side not thinking of adding FLXI to my portfolio as I know india is booming and set to continue growing. Good idea?","YouTube gets a bad rep many times due to so many finance influencers. But there are a handful of very good channels that take a deep dive into financials of individual stocks & comparing performance of ETF's, REIT,s BDC's & other dividend paying stocks.Buying a couple of good stocks in the growth-like AMD-and dividend aristocrat-like O-categories you really can't go wrong. But like the other comment mentions it's a great idea at your age to educate yourself. Luckily today there are so many free resources to learn you can set yourself up to do really well. Congrats on being so conscientious of your financial future & taking control at such a young age.Here are some great YouTube channels:https://www.youtube.com/@DividendTalks/videoshttps://www.youtube.com/@josephhoguehttps://www.youtube.com/@MarkRoussinCPAhttps://www.youtube.com/@NolanGouveia",0,0.524,0.787,NEGATIVE

But do some research into index fund investing and make sure you at least have that bit of education to draw upon. Then when you make choices to select some individual stocks, you'll at least be doing it with eyes wide open.Bogleheads.org or r/Bogleheads to start. The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle if you prefer to read an actual, well-organized book.O is all over the place and has had some deep losses, but it has also recovered significantly already. AMD is but one company in a hot field, so why not diversify into tech or even an ETF that centers around AI? The point is to hedge bets that you might not pick the ""one."" Buy the haystack rather than searching for the needle.",0,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE

Good idea?",I'm not sure we'll see any interest rate cuts except if a recession occurs which doesn't seem likely at the moment. Powell has said that the current rate is restrictive but I don't see any evidence that it's restricting the economy. I wouldn't but O just on the thesis that interest rates will cause it to appreciate.,0,0.545,0.9,NEGATIVE

Good idea?","The investment strategy that makes the most sense to me is warren buffet strategy. He doesn't do short trades. Charle Munger said he doesn't short anymore in his interviews latter on life. All they do is to pick what they think is the best 20 or so companies in the world and put money there long term. You don't want to have too many because you won't have time to keep track of all of them. Warren Buffet is also very patient and tend to go all on a stock he wants in at the right moment.Personally, I stick to a philosophy that is similar to warren buffet. I don't have time to speculate and do short term trades. Most people with 8-5 jobs only have time to long stocks and you will go crazy if you have to keep track of things at each and every moment. I don't like O because it is hardly one of the top companies. AMD is extremely solid, but the current valuation is highly questionable. You should be more patient. If you need to park your money, there are many safe ways to do so with decent returns.",0,0.545,0.753,NEGATIVE
