,"I am in my early 50s - and starting to look at retirement down the road here. If you had a sizable amount (we could use $1 million for this purpose) right now and were looking to retire in 5-10 years what do your investments look like? I kind of have mine grouped in a low/medium/high segmentation and trying to figure out which I feel most comfortable with. Interested in your thoughts on the three below but also on what you would be thinking in that same timeframe. High Risk - Heavy on bitcoin ETF This one is interesting as a lot of bitcoin optimists predict bitcoin to hit 100k - 150k by end of 2025. I am not sure I would hang on to this strategy long term but instead wait to see if it can get over 100k and cash out and then go down to more of a Medium Risk - if I went this route. Medium Risk - Tech Heavy with some ETFs Heavy with some of the big tech like AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMD, etc.... along with some funds like SPY, QQQ and SCHD. This one feels like it could go very well in the next 5-10 years if tech and AI continue to be the forefront of the conversation. It's still not really that diversified but feels like it could maximize returns on the happy path. Low Risk - Retirement centric 2030 or 2035 target funds Almost completely fund based where the investments could be spread amongst a few funds that are 2030 or 2035 target retirement funds and would have the requisite risk associated with retiring in the near term.","In that position I would simply use a single global equity index etf.BTC is a zero sum speculative asset.Investing in particular sectors or nations isn't making the bet you seem to think it is, it's making a bet that markets are mispricing the profitability of tech companies.
