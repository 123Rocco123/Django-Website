Edit link changed and images got removed...","If someone set a buy offer on a call just out of the money for an excessively high premium, someone else might snap it up and hedge the short calls by buying the shares.Then all it would take is for the size of the option quote in shares to be larger than the booked ask-side quotes in the stock. The counterparty could buy shares up to the strike price plus the premium and still profit if called. That would easily move the stock price, as long as the trend wasn't bearish to create risk in the shares, or the HFTs don't jump in to undersell the book.But the counterparty could also write the calls and not offset them. Just set a trigger to buy if the price rises to the strike.So there's a possibility of a move there, but not any mandate.An in-the-money option quote at an unmotivating premium isn't going to make anyone do anything but get inside it with a better deal.",2,0.536,1.0,NEGATIVE
