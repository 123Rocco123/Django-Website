,"I understand one of the important components of fundamental analysis of a stock is PE ratio. Some stocks keep appreciating even with high PE. NVDA.

A high PE ratio, like with stocks such as NVDA, often reflects growth expectations rather than just current earnings. So, while it can indicate overvaluation, it doesn't always mean the stock is a bad investment if there's strong growth potential.When considering stocks with high PEs, like AMD, I think it really comes down to your investment strategy and risk tolerance. If you believe in the company's growth trajectory and have done your homework, you might be comfortable investing even if the PE is above 50. However, if you're more conservative or if the price feels too stretched compared to its earnings potential, then it could be a signal to step back.It's all about balancing potential growth with the risk of overpaying. For me, a PE ratio above 30 would typically raise red flags, but I’d also look at other factors like market conditions, the company's fundamentals, and broader economic indicators.",0,0.558,NEGATIVE,0.811

But for some of the example you site e.g. NVDA. If you look at forward PE they are undervalued by PE standards many apply. But if you dig deeper the story is much more. Customers are on a waiting list to get their products, and NVDA will only sell to those customers that can put the product into use immediately. So there is a lot of bottled up demand. So the PE does not mean a lot. Then you have momentum investing. Great momentum stocks usually have elevated PE’s. Conversely value stocks may appear to be great and have sry low PE, but they are just value traps. I use to use PE’s many years ago, but I seldom look at them. But you have some who get excited about dividends too. And you have no net gain from a dividend. But people get all excited about in essence paying themselves a dividend. Then you have the buy and hold crowd. So you’re going to find a lot of crazy thinking when you start down this investment road.",0,0.529,NEGATIVE,1.0

I remember when Sears had a PE of 3, it ended up bankrupt so you would have lost everything.A PE of 50 (usually) means that future earnings are expected to be high enough to fund buybacks, dividends, or an acquisition from another firm to reward shareholders",0,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.915

A PE of 50 is a steal if you have reason to believe the company is going to 5x its earnings. If you don't have a solid idea of where it's going, and aren't willing to sit on a stock through the ups and downs, then you shouldn't buy at any PE.",0,0.608,NEGATIVE,1.0

Thanks","Honestly, speaking for myself as an individual, the time and effort it takes to really get to the bottom of any company's ""story"" told through its financials, endless ratios of which PE is one, market sentiment, DD deep dive, plus one's own personal bias (not to mention all of these things not just at a single point in time but rather over some meaningful time span- years past, present and forecasting the future).... It only seems to get more overwhelming the more factors and details I've learned to assess.And that's when I know what company I want to look at. But when you don't? Ok, you can start with a filter for some set of bare minimum metrics. Or even specific ""good"" metrics as one sees fit. But you do that starting with 5,000 stocks, filter them down to what, 5 or 10 or 15 serious contenders? How in the heck can any one person go and deep dive 10+ stocks to arrive at 2 or 3, even 1 intelligent pick with a thesis and have any time to, you know, eat, sleep, perhaps work if stock picking isn't one's full time job??Genuine ask here. PE is one of hundreds of things I'm compelled to assess when hunting. Due diligence on one stock can take hours upon hours. But it's always multiple stocks in a sector, industry, trend, whatever, where one is looking for value (whether undervalued based on its past or potentially underpriced based on its growth potential).By the time I'm done with comps the small cap growth stock I've been deep diving is already a large cap dividend stock at terminal growth rate. (!!). This has become the primary reason I get sidelined tbh.What are y'all doing that I'm wasting so much time not doing? No matter how I slice it, I'm always whittled down to a handful but even that handful takes an absurd amount of time to come out with my pick. Which is no guarantee ofc that the market is gonna agree.Is this what IBs have all those thousands of analysts, quants, researchers and bloomie terminals doing all day?? I thought they were mostly admin and EAs. HmmphBut yeah, PE Ratios... ""Don't even get me started."" (SNL throwback)(Oof, I can already see the replies... ""Hours?! You spend HOURS? Are you nuts? It takes me bout 20 min to DD 10 stocks to 1, and every pick crushes it. Maybe you should stick to DCAing VOO?"")ok yes but, help? Cheers",0,0.541,NEGATIVE,0.999

Peter Lynch, the famed investor who ran the Fidelity Magellan Fund, once wrote that he doesn't buy stocks whose PE ratios suggest growth rates higher than 25%. The reasons are simple. Such a level of growth means that that they quickly saturate demand or that the money on the table attracts competitors. This means high levels of growth can quickly be followed by much lower levels, which hurts the long-term returns.Generally speaking, multiples of 50 are insane and not worth buying. You would need an individual edge that doesn't rely on insider knowledge to know why a company priced that way is a good investment.",0,0.542,NEGATIVE,1.0
