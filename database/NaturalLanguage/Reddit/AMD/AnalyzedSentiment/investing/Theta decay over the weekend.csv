For example, I am buying a contract exp next friday. I know for a fact that Sat, Sun, Mon is off. Why would I pay for those days?Think logically, why would someone buy something if they know they will lose money? Why would someone sell something if they know they will lose money. All contracts are $0.00 gain for both buyer and seller at point of sale.Weekends and holidays are known beforehand. It's not like someone don't know that market is not open on Sat & Sun. As such, theta is priced in. All participants knows that market will be closed. Nobody can take advantage of this information. A buyer will not buy a contract and...oops, I didn't know about the weekends. I guess I'm screwed for those 2 days.",2,0.538,1.0,NEGATIVE

Today it would have worked but in general its not a great time to start a short position after the market already fell 5%Also, options are crazy risky.

But options prices are determined by the market not by a model. So your real question is how does the market price options around the weekend. The market prices options based on the actions of individual traders on individual options so there's no correct answer that applies to every situation. All you can do is look at historical data and try to discern how the market prices weekends ""on average"".Here's a pretty good look at this question based on SP500 data: https://sixfigureinvesting.com/2014/10/option-weekend-decay-and-volatility-annualizing/",0,0.534,0.933,NEGATIVE
