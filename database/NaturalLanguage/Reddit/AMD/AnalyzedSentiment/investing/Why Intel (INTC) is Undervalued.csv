,"Why Intel ($INTC) is undervalued This is my first ever stock analysis, any tips will be appreciated. DISCLOSURE: I do not own any shares of Intel at the time of writing. Intel is a chipmaker who has been beaten down by the ongoing global chip shortage. Intel is down from it’s high and has a relatively low P/E value. I am currently bullish on Intel. AMD is currently expensive and overvalued at the moment. AMD has had no availability in the consumer market for quite some time. Intel is finally the more affordable option again (in terms of consumer parts) due to AMD having very limited availability. In terms of stock, Intel is currently down from it’s high and has potential to go back up. Finances First things first, let’s get into Intel’s financials. Over the past few years, Intel has had steady revenue growth: 2017: 62.76B 2018: 70.85B 2019: 71.97B 2020: 77.87B Intel has also been steadily buying back outstanding shares, declining in numbers every year: In 2018, Intel had 4.701B outstanding shares, a 2.77% decrease from 2017. In 2019, Intel had 4.473B outstanding shares, a 4.85% decrease from 2018. In 2020, Intel had 4.232B outstanding shares, a 5.39% decrease from 2019. In March 2021, Intel had 4.096B outstanding shares, a 5.01% decrease from 2020. Competition/Growth Potential Intel has a P/E ratio of 12.80. This is low, compared to the average P/E ratio of 22.69 for the rest of the industry. Intel is also still down from it’s stock price high of ~$68 in April at ~$57 right now. The global chip shortage has been the main cause of Intel being down, along with fierce competition from AMD. As chip production begins to pick back up, Intel’s stock should begin to go up as well. AMD has been hurt greatly from this chip shortage as well, giving Intel a chance to possibly undercut AMD and lead to growth. Intel also plans to build more production plants so that they can keep up with the ever-increasing demand for chips. Intel is still ahead of AMD in market share as well. Intel’s new 11th Gen processors are back on top in terms of speed, especially in laptops. A subsidiary of Intel has also landed a deal with Toyota ($TM) to produce radar technology for Toyota. Final Thoughts Intel seems to be using the chip shortage as a way to come back from their drought. They seem to have been benefiting from it greatly. Intel is not out yet. They still have the market share and resources to compete with AMD. Intel is undervalued and has the capability to bounce back strong from the chip shortage and also has a chance to finally come out on top as the primary choice in the chip market. What are everyone else’s thoughts? I personally believe that Intel is due for a breakout in the next months, but what does everyone else think? I was also wondering about Qualcomm ($QCOM), what does everyone think about that? EDIT: It seems that Intel is more unstable than I originally thought.

Not great.EPS forecasts for AMD at 1.9 and 2.37 giving -7.8% fy1 and 24.7% fy2 respectively.Gross margins are running at 43% and 52% on average so not much in it there,3 year median fy0 to fy2 net income for intel is -1.21% when AMD is 21.5% posing that amd is actually going to out pace intel significantly.INTC Street price target 64.87 - 14.15% upside. AMD Street price target 104.34 - 29% upside.Overall i think the revenue growth needs to come up quite a lot for it to be an allocation, sometimes a cheap P/E leaves you with a dead in the water stoxk if the company can't follow through on its earnings",0,0.58,1.0,NEGATIVE

Thanks for all the replies.",58% returns every 5 years is an acceptable return. Looking at google it’s saying its up 79% over 5 years excluding dividends though. More if you count share buybacks. I wouldn’t call that deadweight. If you averaged those returns over 40 years you’d be feeling pretty happy.,3,0.52,0.871,POSITIVE
,"Why Intel ($INTC) is undervalued This is my first ever stock analysis, any tips will be appreciated. DISCLOSURE: I do not own any shares of Intel at the time of writing. Intel is a chipmaker who has been beaten down by the ongoing global chip shortage. Intel is down from it’s high and has a relatively low P/E value. I am currently bullish on Intel. AMD is currently expensive and overvalued at the moment. AMD has had no availability in the consumer market for quite some time. Intel is finally the more affordable option again (in terms of consumer parts) due to AMD having very limited availability. In terms of stock, Intel is currently down from it’s high and has potential to go back up. Finances First things first, let’s get into Intel’s financials. Over the past few years, Intel has had steady revenue growth: 2017: 62.76B 2018: 70.85B 2019: 71.97B 2020: 77.87B Intel has also been steadily buying back outstanding shares, declining in numbers every year: In 2018, Intel had 4.701B outstanding shares, a 2.77% decrease from 2017.

In March 2021, Intel had 4.096B outstanding shares, a 5.01% decrease from 2020. Competition/Growth Potential Intel has a P/E ratio of 12.80. This is low, compared to the average P/E ratio of 22.69 for the rest of the industry. Intel is also still down from it’s stock price high of ~$68 in April at ~$57 right now. The global chip shortage has been the main cause of Intel being down, along with fierce competition from AMD. As chip production begins to pick back up, Intel’s stock should begin to go up as well. AMD has been hurt greatly from this chip shortage as well, giving Intel a chance to possibly undercut AMD and lead to growth. Intel also plans to build more production plants so that they can keep up with the ever-increasing demand for chips. Intel is still ahead of AMD in market share as well. Intel’s new 11th Gen processors are back on top in terms of speed, especially in laptops. A subsidiary of Intel has also landed a deal with Toyota ($TM) to produce radar technology for Toyota.

In 2019, Intel had 4.473B outstanding shares, a 4.85% decrease from 2018. In 2020, Intel had 4.232B outstanding shares, a 5.39% decrease from 2019. In March 2021, Intel had 4.096B outstanding shares, a 5.01% decrease from 2020. Competition/Growth Potential Intel has a P/E ratio of 12.80. This is low, compared to the average P/E ratio of 22.69 for the rest of the industry. Intel is also still down from it’s stock price high of ~$68 in April at ~$57 right now. The global chip shortage has been the main cause of Intel being down, along with fierce competition from AMD. As chip production begins to pick back up, Intel’s stock should begin to go up as well. AMD has been hurt greatly from this chip shortage as well, giving Intel a chance to possibly undercut AMD and lead to growth. Intel also plans to build more production plants so that they can keep up with the ever-increasing demand for chips. Intel is still ahead of AMD in market share as well. Intel’s new 11th Gen processors are back on top in terms of speed, especially in laptops. A subsidiary of Intel has also landed a deal with Toyota ($TM) to produce radar technology for Toyota. Final Thoughts Intel seems to be using the chip shortage as a way to come back from their drought. They seem to have been benefiting from it greatly. Intel is not out yet. They still have the market share and resources to compete with AMD. Intel is undervalued and has the capability to bounce back strong from the chip shortage and also has a chance to finally come out on top as the primary choice in the chip market.

I was also wondering about Qualcomm ($QCOM), what does everyone think about that? EDIT: It seems that Intel is more unstable than I originally thought. Thanks for all the replies.","As chip production begins to pick back up, Intel’s stock should begin to go up as well.Chip production never significantly dropped, so there is no recovery.The ""chip shortage"" is more accurately: A chip shortage in certain sectors who cancelled their chip orders/slots, which were happily picked up by others expecting a surge (like consumer electronics). Some of these sectors, like cars, who were expecting decreased consumer demand instead witnesses unusually high demand, and they were unable to regain their slots.Also building a chip plant takes at bare minimum five years and that is assuming the wait list for chip manufacturing equipment isn't already years (which, spoilers: it is). Intel's biggest asset is that they're a US company, and there's national security interest in on-shoring. So I expect the USG to bail them out by funding a major US chip production facility within the USA for mostly USG/DoD consumption. In the meantime AMD/TSM will continue to eat Intel's lunch, and their market share (which is a lagging indicator) will continue to shrink.While I'm bullish on Intel over tens of years for the reason above, I'm bearish right now as I don't believe we've hit the bottom. P/E may actually get worse if earnings sink as Intel tries to compete with AMD's superior products in the enterprise/data-center space (i.e. deep discounts).So I may buy Intel but not at $57, maybe at $45~.",0,0.55,1.0,NEGATIVE

However, what you point out about them being a US company and national security interests is why I decided to hold. While there’s still a lot of unknowns about how this whole “chip shortage” thing will play out, I think the national security aspect will play an even greater role in the near future. While seemingly unrelated, the recent announcement of investigations into the origins of COVID-19 really caught me by surprise, and I think it paints how the current administration will deal with China, which will probably lead to a greater emphasis on domestic production of equipment.You’re right in that TSMC’s market share is pretty ridiculous, but I think that could set a company like intel up for a “strategic surprise” if tensions with China increase dramatically. Even though there’s not a lot of info as to how the US increase in domestic production is going to work, I just see it as an underlying current that can only work in intel’s favor.https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-urges-50-billion-to-boost-chip-manufacturing-in-u-s-11617211570https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/intel-is-spending-20-billion-to-build-two-new-chip-plants-in-arizona.html",1,0.55,0.728,NEGATIVE

As a result, fab specialists like TSMC, GF, and Samsung have leapfrogged intel (because they can focus on building better processes and can always sell capacity for those processes).Semiconductors is a highly competitive industry, where a slight competitive advantage rapidly turns into market leadership. AMD is the current market leader in CPU and server offerings, while NVIDIA, ARM, and homegrown SoCs like Apple M1 are encroaching on Intel's other LoBs. This is gradually eroding Intel's enterprise agreements, which are a major source of revenue.Intel's financials are excellent, but that has come at the cost of R&D progress. We are seeing the results of that now. Intel realizes this, and has made significant changes in management. They're even trying to sell fab capacity to third parties. This is good - but it remains to be seen if Intel can execute on its new strategy fast enough to take back market leadership.re: chip shortage: ending the chip shortage brings a new problem, which is that the marginal cost of wafer production is very small, meaning fabs are incentivized to run at full capacity, all of the time. This means that, with all these different players expanding fab capacity, we might over-correct into a supply glut, bringing down the price of chips. Furthermore, in a supply glut scenario, I suspect fabless manufacturers would prefer to work with foundries not owned by a potential competitor, which poses a risk to Intel's goal of becoming a fab for third parties. It's not as simple as ""shortage ends -> revenue up.""I personally think INTC is undervalued, and I hold INTC - but I think it's far from a simple or risk-free investment.",0,0.537,0.875,NEGATIVE

TSMC have over 50% market share and a very healthy ecosystem. AMD and Apple are core customers of TSMC. trust is going to be a big issues for Intel. TSMC have even higher market cap than Intel with bigger capex spending. Its going to be hard for Intel to fight in this spaceChip design - Intel is clearly behind AMD and Apple on price/performance. Apple ditching Intel is showing other PC makers/vendors that you don't need Intel's chip. the FACT to the matter is, you can design your own chip that make your product stand out than using common chip like Intel's. Intel going to burn money on Chip design to be attractive enough for other company like Google, Microsoft..etc. to ditch designing its own chip.Server/Client - Intel is losing on both client (consumers) and server. AMD is killing it on both client and server. Apple is shattering Intel Inside on consumer side. Microsoft is ditching Intel as well and working with Qualcomm on Windows for ARM. AWS is using its own chip for their cloud offering.Intel going to spend a lot of money on upgrading its fab and R&D on fab process and secure equipment.

,"Why Intel ($INTC) is undervalued This is my first ever stock analysis, any tips will be appreciated. DISCLOSURE: I do not own any shares of Intel at the time of writing. Intel is a chipmaker who has been beaten down by the ongoing global chip shortage. Intel is down from it’s high and has a relatively low P/E value. I am currently bullish on Intel. AMD is currently expensive and overvalued at the moment. AMD has had no availability in the consumer market for quite some time. Intel is finally the more affordable option again (in terms of consumer parts) due to AMD having very limited availability. In terms of stock, Intel is currently down from it’s high and has potential to go back up. Finances First things first, let’s get into Intel’s financials.

All of Intel's chips are fabricated internally, whereas fabless semi companies (AMD, NVDA, QCOM, AVGO) design their products and contract the manufacturing process out to foundries. The biggest source of the chip shortage is TSMC and Samsung (two foundries which fabricate majority of digital semis) running out of capacity in the middle of last year. In theory, Intel should be taking advantage of the fact it's an IDM; it's supply is not governed by another company, like AMD's is.Your argument also skips the gigantic, glaring problem with Intel and why AMD has been on fire. Intel lost the 60-year advantage it had in process technology and over the past year, their problems have gotten worse. Haven't reviewed in a bit but I believe their 7nm process is due for 2023 while TSMC and possibly Samsung are ramping 5nm by the end of this year. That is a MASSIVE disadvantage for Intel because it means their products are inherently slower and less powerful.Intel's financials are not at risk of cratering by any means. It has a massive presence all around the world and it's not like it's going to go bankrupt. But the problem is on the qualitative side - Intel's mishaps during previous process nodes (14nm and 10nm) gave AMD/TSMC the lead, and now those problems are spilling into 7nm.Edit: typo",0,0.559,1.0,NEGATIVE

Over the past few years, Intel has had steady revenue growth: 2017: 62.76B 2018: 70.85B 2019: 71.97B 2020: 77.87B Intel has also been steadily buying back outstanding shares, declining in numbers every year: In 2018, Intel had 4.701B outstanding shares, a 2.77% decrease from 2017. In 2019, Intel had 4.473B outstanding shares, a 4.85% decrease from 2018. In 2020, Intel had 4.232B outstanding shares, a 5.39% decrease from 2019. In March 2021, Intel had 4.096B outstanding shares, a 5.01% decrease from 2020. Competition/Growth Potential Intel has a P/E ratio of 12.80. This is low, compared to the average P/E ratio of 22.69 for the rest of the industry. Intel is also still down from it’s stock price high of ~$68 in April at ~$57 right now. The global chip shortage has been the main cause of Intel being down, along with fierce competition from AMD. As chip production begins to pick back up, Intel’s stock should begin to go up as well. AMD has been hurt greatly from this chip shortage as well, giving Intel a chance to possibly undercut AMD and lead to growth. Intel also plans to build more production plants so that they can keep up with the ever-increasing demand for chips. Intel is still ahead of AMD in market share as well. Intel’s new 11th Gen processors are back on top in terms of speed, especially in laptops. A subsidiary of Intel has also landed a deal with Toyota ($TM) to produce radar technology for Toyota. Final Thoughts Intel seems to be using the chip shortage as a way to come back from their drought. They seem to have been benefiting from it greatly. Intel is not out yet. They still have the market share and resources to compete with AMD. Intel is undervalued and has the capability to bounce back strong from the chip shortage and also has a chance to finally come out on top as the primary choice in the chip market. What are everyone else’s thoughts? I personally believe that Intel is due for a breakout in the next months, but what does everyone else think? I was also wondering about Qualcomm ($QCOM), what does everyone think about that? EDIT: It seems that Intel is more unstable than I originally thought.

,"Why Intel ($INTC) is undervalued This is my first ever stock analysis, any tips will be appreciated. DISCLOSURE: I do not own any shares of Intel at the time of writing. Intel is a chipmaker who has been beaten down by the ongoing global chip shortage. Intel is down from it’s high and has a relatively low P/E value. I am currently bullish on Intel. AMD is currently expensive and overvalued at the moment. AMD has had no availability in the consumer market for quite some time. Intel is finally the more affordable option again (in terms of consumer parts) due to AMD having very limited availability. In terms of stock, Intel is currently down from it’s high and has potential to go back up. Finances First things first, let’s get into Intel’s financials. Over the past few years, Intel has had steady revenue growth: 2017: 62.76B 2018: 70.85B 2019: 71.97B 2020: 77.87B Intel has also been steadily buying back outstanding shares, declining in numbers every year: In 2018, Intel had 4.701B outstanding shares, a 2.77% decrease from 2017.

In one year INTC makes more than AMD has ever made in its history (this is a rough estimate based on net income not revenue).AMD would have to double 4 times and INTC would have to remain completely stagnant in order for AMD to catch up. This is also using their numbers for 2020, if you use the 2019 net income AMD would have to double 80 times.No matter how innovative you are, its hard to overcome that.

In 2019, Intel had 4.473B outstanding shares, a 4.85% decrease from 2018. In 2020, Intel had 4.232B outstanding shares, a 5.39% decrease from 2019. In March 2021, Intel had 4.096B outstanding shares, a 5.01% decrease from 2020. Competition/Growth Potential Intel has a P/E ratio of 12.80. This is low, compared to the average P/E ratio of 22.69 for the rest of the industry. Intel is also still down from it’s stock price high of ~$68 in April at ~$57 right now. The global chip shortage has been the main cause of Intel being down, along with fierce competition from AMD. As chip production begins to pick back up, Intel’s stock should begin to go up as well. AMD has been hurt greatly from this chip shortage as well, giving Intel a chance to possibly undercut AMD and lead to growth. Intel also plans to build more production plants so that they can keep up with the ever-increasing demand for chips. Intel is still ahead of AMD in market share as well. Intel’s new 11th Gen processors are back on top in terms of speed, especially in laptops. A subsidiary of Intel has also landed a deal with Toyota ($TM) to produce radar technology for Toyota. Final Thoughts Intel seems to be using the chip shortage as a way to come back from their drought. They seem to have been benefiting from it greatly. Intel is not out yet. They still have the market share and resources to compete with AMD. Intel is undervalued and has the capability to bounce back strong from the chip shortage and also has a chance to finally come out on top as the primary choice in the chip market.

Also, they’ve announced delays for their 7nm process and don’t plan to have any until late 2022 or early 2023 (barring further delays).It’s great that they’ve been able to squeeze every bit of performance out of the chips they’re able to economically produce, but they need to reduce their transistor size to keep up with the power efficiency of the competition.",2,0.532,0.951,NEGATIVE

In terms of stock, Intel is currently down from it’s high and has potential to go back up. Finances First things first, let’s get into Intel’s financials. Over the past few years, Intel has had steady revenue growth: 2017: 62.76B 2018: 70.85B 2019: 71.97B 2020: 77.87B Intel has also been steadily buying back outstanding shares, declining in numbers every year: In 2018, Intel had 4.701B outstanding shares, a 2.77% decrease from 2017. In 2019, Intel had 4.473B outstanding shares, a 4.85% decrease from 2018. In 2020, Intel had 4.232B outstanding shares, a 5.39% decrease from 2019. In March 2021, Intel had 4.096B outstanding shares, a 5.01% decrease from 2020. Competition/Growth Potential Intel has a P/E ratio of 12.80. This is low, compared to the average P/E ratio of 22.69 for the rest of the industry. Intel is also still down from it’s stock price high of ~$68 in April at ~$57 right now. The global chip shortage has been the main cause of Intel being down, along with fierce competition from AMD. As chip production begins to pick back up, Intel’s stock should begin to go up as well. AMD has been hurt greatly from this chip shortage as well, giving Intel a chance to possibly undercut AMD and lead to growth. Intel also plans to build more production plants so that they can keep up with the ever-increasing demand for chips. Intel is still ahead of AMD in market share as well. Intel’s new 11th Gen processors are back on top in terms of speed, especially in laptops. A subsidiary of Intel has also landed a deal with Toyota ($TM) to produce radar technology for Toyota. Final Thoughts Intel seems to be using the chip shortage as a way to come back from their drought. They seem to have been benefiting from it greatly. Intel is not out yet. They still have the market share and resources to compete with AMD. Intel is undervalued and has the capability to bounce back strong from the chip shortage and also has a chance to finally come out on top as the primary choice in the chip market. What are everyone else’s thoughts? I personally believe that Intel is due for a breakout in the next months, but what does everyone else think? I was also wondering about Qualcomm ($QCOM), what does everyone think about that? EDIT: It seems that Intel is more unstable than I originally thought. Thanks for all the replies.","SummaryI recommend you to build your thesis on business quality before diving into the financials and valuations. Numbers don’t mean much in business point of view if qualitative factors are not analysed.My biggest concerns on Intel are more on the qualitative endManagement has been changing and needs stability. There have been 3 CEOs since 2018ish.The new CEO (ex-VMWare guy), started with Intel this year, so he is yet to show in details how he could help intel to compete. Looking forward to his plan.With point 1., management has not been clear enough on the product strategy or/and focus. So, I don't feel clear enough which segments would Intel want to hit hard going forward.CommentsYou need to incorporate qualitative summary or details to align with financial performance.Remember AMD has CPU, GPU, and custom chip (console) biz. So, the offerings are different than Intel’s. AMD is subject to higher cyclicity, esp. now, than Intel would, due to new console launches (in every 7ish years).Without those qualitative findings, the growth numbers are not compared in an apples-to-apples manner.You need to compare both technical and financial performance of Intel PC CPUs to those in AMD, but not just the topline rev.QuestionsWhat is Intel product offering different than AMD’s?How bad could its margins be compressed by AMD’s ongoing share gain in both PC CPU and Server CPU?Could other product offerings (e.g. memory or/and Mobileye) be any possible revenue or margin contributors to Intel? If so, what findings could back those up?Remember that semi industry is always in ebb and flow, it is currently in short supply not only due to hardware demand shock from the pandemic, but it was also due to reduced component supplies back in 2016/2017 period when there was an oversupply.",0,0.543,0.967,NEGATIVE
,"Why Intel ($INTC) is undervalued This is my first ever stock analysis, any tips will be appreciated. DISCLOSURE: I do not own any shares of Intel at the time of writing. Intel is a chipmaker who has been beaten down by the ongoing global chip shortage. Intel is down from it’s high and has a relatively low P/E value. I am currently bullish on Intel.
