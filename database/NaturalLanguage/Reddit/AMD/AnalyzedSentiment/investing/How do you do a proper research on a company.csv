,"I am trying to level up my game, and for a pretty long time I just looked at the balance sheet, a few ratios, P/E, forward P/E, compared these to the industry average, healthy cash flow, debt etc. Most of the time I just did this on well known stocks, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, INTC, AMD, META etc. basically companies you hear about a lot everywhere, I just had no trust in lesser known companies to outperform the market, even if these basic metrics were promising. Now it worked out relatively well since I started investing, but I feel like I didn't really beat the market by too much with my stock picks given the extra risk I took. There was a study by Cornell, where one of the graphs show the % of SP500 stocks beating the SP500, and while the data doesn't go back too much -would love to see one that goes back until 1970-1980 at least-. however for the 2014-2023 period it can be seen that about 40-50% of the companies beat the 'market'. So basically if you stock pick with a random generator you have a good chance to have a similar performance to the market. So I believe with a proper educated research it would be possible to tip the scales in our favor. So I feel like the way I picked stocks was sort of look at the most hyped and known companies, have a basic glance on some ratios and the balance sheet, and I feel like this is so bad that it will bite back after a while. I see quite a few people here on reddit and some other communities knowing so much about a company, the moat they have, why it's a good investment, why it would be a bad one etc. What is the proper approach to get information? What sources are valuable? I assume earning reports are one, but I doubt they have all the information of the industry the company is in, why it's better than competitors etc. surely there are some other sources that are used for all this. Any advice is appreciated!","Picking stocks is like trying to guess the winner of a beauty contest. Don't pick the one you think is most beautiful, pick the one the market thinks is most beautiful.There was a certain popular stock today that reported impressive earnings and forecasts. It's reward was a 7% kick in the ass. Fundamentals are meaningless except in the very long term. A lot of bad things can happen before the long term gets here.",0,0.546,NEGATIVE,0.999

Then I follow that company for a period of time, Maybe 2 or 3 quarters to see how they deliver, then if I like it, I start buying shares.For example, in 2019 I bought a lot of Tandem Diabetes Care shares. They were recovering, successfully, from a near bankruptcy event, because they were selling a high performance insulin pump. I was familiar with the product because my mother used it for her type 1 diabetes and was thrilled with it. The thesis was basically that the product would sell good enough that the company would become profitable etc, so I was buying shares and reviewing earnings while it climbed on future hype.I ended up selling in 2021 when the company really had failed to meet the profit expectations due to various reasons. The stock had fallen from its all time high, but I had still doubled my money. So in 3 years time, I made a 100% return. I moved on from it and I have no idea what that company has done since. I think doing this successfully is a bit of an art and requires a special kind of patience and risk tolerance.

So I feel like the way I picked stocks was sort of look at the most hyped and known companies, have a basic glance on some ratios and the balance sheet, and I feel like this is so bad that it will bite back after a while. I see quite a few people here on reddit and some other communities knowing so much about a company, the moat they have, why it's a good investment, why it would be a bad one etc. What is the proper approach to get information? What sources are valuable? I assume earning reports are one, but I doubt they have all the information of the industry the company is in, why it's better than competitors etc. surely there are some other sources that are used for all this. Any advice is appreciated!",I compare risk factors when I look at returns in the same sector or industry.,0,0.519,POSITIVE,0.854
,"I am trying to level up my game, and for a pretty long time I just looked at the balance sheet, a few ratios, P/E, forward P/E, compared these to the industry average, healthy cash flow, debt etc. Most of the time I just did this on well known stocks, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, INTC, AMD, META etc. basically companies you hear about a lot everywhere, I just had no trust in lesser known companies to outperform the market, even if these basic metrics were promising. Now it worked out relatively well since I started investing, but I feel like I didn't really beat the market by too much with my stock picks given the extra risk I took. There was a study by Cornell, where one of the graphs show the % of SP500 stocks beating the SP500, and while the data doesn't go back too much -would love to see one that goes back until 1970-1980 at least-. however for the 2014-2023 period it can be seen that about 40-50% of the companies beat the 'market'. So basically if you stock pick with a random generator you have a good chance to have a similar performance to the market. So I believe with a proper educated research it would be possible to tip the scales in our favor.

Any advice is appreciated!",Use your brokerage research. Often there are several free reports that can be found as you pull up a ticker. The other source of good information is the quarterly conference calls. You can often find these calls on Yahoo finance or with your brokerage. I look at finance reports to see if debt is going up or down. I also look at sales to see if they are increasing - same with cash. Hope this helps.,0,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.88

If still interested (down to 2-3 possibles) I read their 10K. Then I run my own numbers.
