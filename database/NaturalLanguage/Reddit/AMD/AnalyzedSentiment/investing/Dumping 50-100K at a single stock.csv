,"Hey all, Looking to get outside perspective on dropping $50-$100K on a single stock. Some context: 30 years old, been investing seriously since 2017 Current portfolio size: $250K Portfolio consists of mainly standard stocks: S&P etfs, QQQ, FANGM, AMD, SHOP, LULU, NIKE, Banks, Credit cards, ATZ, some airlines, and a few others. I’d say I have around 22 stocks. Income: very fortunate to be in the $250-$300K range Up until now, I’ve been fairly safe with my investments and haven’t made any big bets on any singular stocks, largest position would be about $7-8K (not including ETFs). My returns have been modest, 60% in the past 2.5-3 years. However, when I look at my top performing stocks, which were the ones I had the most confidence in buying, I didn’t make a big purchase and some are +100% all the way up to +700%. Turning 1-2K into 5-10K is nice, but I’m feeling like I want to try and accelerate my net worth faster. The TLDR is that I’m able to save/invest between $60-80K / yr and at this point in my life, if I were to take a $100K position in a single stock that dropped by say, 80%, my life would largely be unaffected (other than slowing my eventual retirement down a bit). I like the small wins I’ve gotten, but if I want to “become wealthy” at a relatively young age, 35-40, I don’t see my current path getting me there. So, what are everyone’s thoughts on me taking a more sizeable position in a company I believe in. This stock would not be something overly risky (no small cap), maybe a FANGM stock, no memes like TSLA. A company with a proven successful track record for years. All comments appreciated!",You say returns of 60% in 2.5-3 years is modest?I’d do more time in market to realize what a “normal” return would be before taking a significant risk on one stock. 99% of people would be over the moon with those returns. They aren’t normal.Seems like you have FOMO. Tread carefully,0,0.539,0.976,NEGATIVE

His point was that if you had a maximum of 10 companies you could invest in for life you would A) know those companies inside and out because obviously you want to make a good investment and B) hold onto those companies for a long time because you are using one of your few “lifetime companies”.People often forget that Warren Buffets number one rule to investing is don’t lose money.

One is to invest the same amount in an order on the VWAP every day, or week, or month. However often you choose, but spread it out gradually so that you will lower your chances on getting hit with a dip right after you invest if you were to buy 100% at once. You could also just make it easy on yourself and get an app like Stash, and set it to auto invest whatever amount you want however often you like. I’ve been having them do this for Google and Amazon for a couple years. It pretty convenient and requires little to no effort.Wait for a significant dip. It is true that things are way overbought right now, especially in the tech sector and the FAANG stocks. There will be a time like in mid-March when a significant dip will happen, it’s inevitable. These are the times to go in heavy, it’s how people with money make more money fast, unlike other people who take a hit and don’t have anything left when the market downturns, the rich can keep their head above water and effectively exploit the recession/downturn and make it work for them. Fortunes are made this way.I personally prefer the first method because it doesn’t involve having to time the market, and it can hedge against a stock you want thriving while you wait by giving you at least partial exposure. With that being said, I have managed to put together a little emergency fund for trading to take advantage of a dip if it happens. I would mostly just keep it simple and go long SPY, QQQ, DIA, etc.",0,0.531,0.626,NEGATIVE

,"Hey all, Looking to get outside perspective on dropping $50-$100K on a single stock. Some context: 30 years old, been investing seriously since 2017 Current portfolio size: $250K Portfolio consists of mainly standard stocks: S&P etfs, QQQ, FANGM, AMD, SHOP, LULU, NIKE, Banks, Credit cards, ATZ, some airlines, and a few others. I’d say I have around 22 stocks. Income: very fortunate to be in the $250-$300K range Up until now, I’ve been fairly safe with my investments and haven’t made any big bets on any singular stocks, largest position would be about $7-8K (not including ETFs). My returns have been modest, 60% in the past 2.5-3 years. However, when I look at my top performing stocks, which were the ones I had the most confidence in buying, I didn’t make a big purchase and some are +100% all the way up to +700%. Turning 1-2K into 5-10K is nice, but I’m feeling like I want to try and accelerate my net worth faster. The TLDR is that I’m able to save/invest between $60-80K / yr and at this point in my life, if I were to take a $100K position in a single stock that dropped by say, 80%, my life would largely be unaffected (other than slowing my eventual retirement down a bit). I like the small wins I’ve gotten, but if I want to “become wealthy” at a relatively young age, 35-40, I don’t see my current path getting me there. So, what are everyone’s thoughts on me taking a more sizeable position in a company I believe in.
