Not saying it won’t help them at least preserve the dividend where it’s at but there’s a chance it doesn’t increase significantly for a long while. Could soften the dullness of waiting for their R&D to pay off though.Personally I’ve been considering it as a mean reversion trade since they’re at or near a 5 yr low, but I’m not sold on them returning to where they were. They do have a huge arsenal of software engineers but they missed the boat on ARM, lost Apple’s business (and others may copy the in-house approach e.g. MSFT with Surface devices).

They've formed a low cost partnership with AWS who then makes AMD-powered server instances available to customers at a 10% discount over Intel-powered equivalents. It's a strong maneuver to capture market share.Intel is still king of the server, but it's not an unshakable position. The competition is the strongest it's been in a very long time, and Intel's reputation is the weakest it's been in a long time. Meltdown and Spectre were 4 years ago but the industry's memory is long when it comes to vulnerabilities that severe with performance impacts that debilitating. While hardware mitigations have been in place since late 2018, at the time of the disclosures Intel announced that a fully resilient architecture redesign would not be complete until around now, so internally Intel is still feeling the aftershocks of those vulnerabilities too.I don't think Intel is anywhere near going the way of IBM, but their position is the worst it's been in a long time.

So please point me to any statements made by intels leadership that they are going to do this, as opposed to relying on their own FABs. I have yet to see any such plan announced, but if I missed something I will happily admit to being wrong if you can produce evidence of such a plan.Intel may have officially moved behind the competition 5 years ago, but it was the repeated failures to achieve their stated technical goals for new chip lines over more than a decade which led to such a thing happening. The rot at Intel is far older than 5 years.And yes, this is an investing thread. Intels future viability as a company heavily depends on being able to catch up to its competitors. AMD has been devouring intels market share in traditional markets, and as soon as Microsoft has a good ARM compatibility layer for windows Intel is in deeper trouble as their x86 bread and butter will be dead and burried. Other companies can just use TSMC to make the transition, but as long as Intel insists on using their own FABs they will have to shoulder the burden on their own.For the record, I do hope that we have more quality FABs than just TSMC in the world. I'm just saying Intel has a LOT to do to prove they're really turning things around. They can retool to become the future of chips again, or they can fade away into obscurity.

,"Recently released financials from Intel disappointed investors. The figures turned out to be much worse than expected and the share price flew down. When the share price falls, the dividend yield naturally rises. But the question sharply arises - ""can the company continue to pay and increase its dividend payments"". I use 3 groups of indicators to determine the financial stability of a company: Liquidity, Financial stability and Profitability Ratios. Liquidity: Cash Ratio = Cash + Cash Equivalents ÷ Current Liabilities, must be > 0,2 Quick Ratio = Cash + Cash Equivalents + Short-term Investments + Accounts Receivable ÷ Current Liabilities, must be > 1,0 Current Ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities, must be > 2,0 According to the latest reports, Intel is on the borderline of liquidity and starts running out of money (FCF TTM -1 522 also tells it): Cash Ratio = 0,16 < 0,2 Quick Ratio = 0,99 < 1.0 Current Ratio = 1,85 < 2,0 Financial stability: Equity Ratio = Total Equity ÷ Total Assets, must be > 0,4 Debt Ratio = Total Liabilities ÷ Total Assets, must be < 0,6 Debt to Equity = Total Liabilities ÷ Total Equity, must be 0,4 - 1,0, but < 1,5 Interest coverage ratio = EBIT ÷ Interest Expenses, must be > 1,5 Intel is financially stable and able to pay current dividend levels in the near future Equity Ratio = 0.59 > 0,4 Debt Ratio = 0,4 < 0,6 Debt to Equity = 0,68 Interest coverage ratio = 17,3 Profitability: Gross Profit Margin % = Gross Profit ÷ Revenue Operating Profit Margin % = Operating Profit ÷ Revenue Net Profit Margin % = Net Income ÷ Revenue ROA (Return on Assets) = Net Income ÷ Total Assets ROE (Return on Equity) = Net Income ÷ Average Shareholder’s Equity Profitability ratios should be compared with other companies in the sector in order to determine the place among competitors, here the numbers for Intel - AMD - Nvidia (because you like to compare them): Gross Profit Margin = 49,8% > 48,5% < 65,25% Operating Profit Margin = 18,8% < 20,8% < 33,6% Net Profit Margin = 26% > 17,9% < 32% ROA = 11,2% > 5% < 31,9% ROE = 19,4% > 10,8% < 35,7% Nvidia beats all, but Intel looks also good.
