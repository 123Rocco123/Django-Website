,"Iâ€™m 28 with full contribution to HSA (FZROX/FZILX 75/25), Roth IRA (100 FXAIX), and 401k (Target Retirement Date Fund), as well as a HYSA for emergency savings and looking into opening a brokerage for both long term investments (house, new car, etc) and short term (quality of life purchases, vacation, etc) and was contemplating what to invest in. For the long term investments I was considering 65/35 VTI/VXUS or 40/25/25/10 VTI/VXUS/AVUV/AVDV For short term I was looking into playing with individual stocks such as Walmart, Amazon, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Meta, Intel, Amd, Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Blackrock, Endeavor, Disney, Tesla, Games workshop, Hasbro at 5% each then 10% a mutual index fund/etf Any suggestions or feedback would be appreciated.","Money for short-term goals shouldn't be in stocks, especially not individual stocks. HYSA, money market fund, or a CD will ensure that the money will be there when you need it.Buying individual stocks or sector funds creates unnecessary & uncompensated risk; I avoid doing so. Index funds are boring, but better for making money. If I wanted to talk about my interesting investments at parties or wanted a new hobby, I might invest 5-10% of my portfolio in individual stocks. As it is, I own pretty much every publicly-traded company in the world; that's interesting enough for me.All of the individual stocks & sector funds are being followed by thousands or millions of other investors. Current prices reflect their collective knowledge of future expectations for each one. I'm a member of the Triple Nine Society, but I'm not smarter than all of them. If I found a stock or sector that looked like a bargain, the most likely explanation would be that the others know something I don't.",0,0.551,1.0,NEGATIVE
