,"AMD's stock jumped this week from $81 to $86, with calls paying a lot more. Why? Because AMD has made great inroads in graphic cards and well-priced GPUs. But unlike NVIDIA, AMD has been chosen for MSFT and Sony's consoles, resulting in the likely 39% predicted growth in sales in 2020 alone. That means, likely, the new cycles are going to leave AMD continuing to make significant gains with NVIDIA trailing. Thoughts?",They were chosen for MS and Sony because AMD is willing to come down more in price and accept lower margins than NVIDIA and because AMD is willing to work with them to slightly customize the chips for the consoles. NVIDIA didn’t want to customize the chips. Overall NVIDIA still offers the superior product. We will know more when NVIDIA announces new 3xxx cards or whatever they are called. I’m still betting NVIDIA will be ahead of AMD.,0,0.57,0.998,POSITIVE

I think AMD still has runway but I think Intel will eventually get themselves sorted out. Along with what other changes coming down the road in the future.So my question is should I take profit now? From what I have read long term capital gains are not taxed in 2020 if your AGI is less than 80k. I fit that description. I would like to sell half of my AMD position and put it in Tesla.What do you guys think?,0,0.554,0.978,NEGATIVE

Ok sure its a good company and no its not gonna go bankruptBut here is the problem : 1.tesla is now worth more than VW,Toyota and honda TOGETHER 2. Together these companies sold 26Million cars (with basically the same margin as tesla) 3.tesla sold 200k thats nothing... 4.dont come at me with growth etc last year tesla's car sales grewth by 0,3% sure there is potential but the stock was shot through the moonIts just a question of time till it crashes back downAlso Competition is getting strong just look at the id.3 almost the same specs(slower acceleration but no one wants to race this thing anyways) and considereble cheaperAnd if you still really want to have tesla in your portfolio buy them montly or bimonthly to average the cost down",1,0.548,1.0,NEGATIVE

Thoughts?","I hear what you are saying but I am also thinking of the recent success in Space X. Plus, Telsa doesn't do ICE. Less resources to be expended. The other auto manufacturers have to straddle both designs. I don't have any great hope as to what GM or Ford will do with EV. Their past track record isn't that good. I admit, Telsa could be a mistake. But I think it wouldn't be bad to have a position after the split.",2,0.517,0.996,NEGATIVE

Thoughts?",The reason AMD keeps going up is that on the server/datacenter side they are barely reaching 10% market share. While Intel will catch up at some point they are behind on physical node development and architecture so it could take them years. Also on the GPU side the position is similar they barely have any footing in the datacenter and compute but they are slowly getting in place.,0,0.55,0.946,NEGATIVE
