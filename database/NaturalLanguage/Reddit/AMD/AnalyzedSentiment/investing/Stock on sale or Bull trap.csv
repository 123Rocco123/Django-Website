,"Many of us are probably thinking about buying the dip because stock is on sale. That is a valid strategy if we look at the dip in the right context. If a stock is under-priced or reasonably priced, then the dip presents a huge buying opportunity because the stock is now even more under-priced. If a stock is over-hyped and has seen massive gain over very short period of time, then the dip is a trap. So let look at some number: Pre-covid Price (Feb 20) Gain (from Feb 20 to Aug 31) Drop (from Aug 31 to Sep 4) Tesla $179.88 177.03% -16.05% Apple $80.08 61.14% -6.26% AMD $58.90 58.58% -9.71 On Aug 31, Tesla was at 177.03% above its pre-covid price. Now, it just drops 16.05%. Is it on sale? Obviously no because it's still more than 100% above its pre-covid price. Imagine during Labor Day, stores increase their merchandise's price heavily and then put a 16%-off sticker on it. Would you rush into the stores to buy the merchandise because it's 16% off? Most likely no. We are only 60 days away from the presidential election, so there are a lot of uncertainty and volatility. So don't FOMO or YOLO into buying the dip of all the ATH stocks.

I should start looking at banks and companies like Deere too.ETA: there are some great companies in the tech sector though that I think have room to run still.

The above companies have been running for up to 100 years in the case of SPGI.SPGI and MCO do credit ratings. They also rate governments. Companies cannot issue debt without them, so they’re heavily insulated short of a major catastrophe on the world scale.FICO is personal credit scores; can’t get a loan without them.ODFL is freight. I’ve found it always good to watch how LTL transportation moves, as it seems like a reasonable indicator of our economy; I like ODFL because it’s mostly corporate shipments and not personal packages (eg UPS/Fedex)Here’s some historical performance data in case you’re interested in seeing how a blended investment in these companies has done.

This doesn't mean that you must be in equities, but it means that you need to have something that provides compounding returns (e.g. real estate and precious metals are alternate examples of things that are easily measured and compound).Capital earned through labor is the easiest capital for most people to obtain. Pushing that capital earned from your work into a compounding vehicle is the best way to set yourself up for the future.As far as stocks being ""on-sale"" or not, this shouldn't matter unless you are investing money that you cannot afford to lose. Zoom out on the SPY and all drawdowns look minor, especially if you were adding money consistently (e.g. every paycheck). I added more to my positions today, because I believe that by even as soon as this time next year, the market will be in a higher place. If it's not, then that's okay too, as I'll have added in lots of additional capital, since I do not care at all about volatility. I find comfort in the historical precedent that one day the market will be green again. People tend to overreact on red days and start to think about the ""worst case scenarios"" and ultimately these scenarios usually do not materialize.",0,0.524,0.988,NEGATIVE

Most likely no. We are only 60 days away from the presidential election, so there are a lot of uncertainty and volatility. So don't FOMO or YOLO into buying the dip of all the ATH stocks. And take profit if you already have massive gain.","The whole thing is a house of cards and we’ve just started to see it wobble. That last hour Apple bull trap that happened late on today was pure genius, I can’t imagine how many people went long only to see that sharp fire sale right at the end. I think Tuesday will be an absolute bloodbath. Grim.",0,0.517,0.642,NEGATIVE
,"Many of us are probably thinking about buying the dip because stock is on sale. That is a valid strategy if we look at the dip in the right context. If a stock is under-priced or reasonably priced, then the dip presents a huge buying opportunity because the stock is now even more under-priced. If a stock is over-hyped and has seen massive gain over very short period of time, then the dip is a trap. So let look at some number: Pre-covid Price (Feb 20) Gain (from Feb 20 to Aug 31) Drop (from Aug 31 to Sep 4) Tesla $179.88 177.03% -16.05% Apple $80.08 61.14% -6.26% AMD $58.90 58.58% -9.71 On Aug 31, Tesla was at 177.03% above its pre-covid price. Now, it just drops 16.05%. Is it on sale? Obviously no because it's still more than 100% above its pre-covid price. Imagine during Labor Day, stores increase their merchandise's price heavily and then put a 16%-off sticker on it. Would you rush into the stores to buy the merchandise because it's 16% off? Most likely no. We are only 60 days away from the presidential election, so there are a lot of uncertainty and volatility. So don't FOMO or YOLO into buying the dip of all the ATH stocks. And take profit if you already have massive gain.","You’re right. I’m long Apple but I agree that most tech stocks are overpriced despite this week’s ‘correction’. Whether the dip is a trap is another issue. Many speculate that we’re on the way up again from next week, with ‘healthy’ dips in coming months.",0,0.531,0.878,POSITIVE

If you weren't going to buy it last month, why are you buying it at the same price?
