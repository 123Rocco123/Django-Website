,"With the volatility and uncertainty of the economy and future FED policies, I've been thinking of pulling most of my positions while selling a put on QQQ and buying a leap as well. Since I'm selling a put on QQQ, I need the available funds (cash secured). Margin willing, I'd like to store that cash and give it upside potential while eliminating downside risk. That's where the married put came to mind, say buy 100 shares of something along the lines of NVDA, TSLA, or AMD shares and buying an ATM put far out (1-2 years) for each 100 shares (rolling covered calls also to help reduce premium for the put) But I got to thinking, what advantage does that actually serve over just doing a call LEAP? I could buy the leap and store my cash in some low volatility dividend fund and still buy protective puts for much cheaper. So, which is really better, the married put ( for this instance think 2 years) or the call LEAP?","They're effectively the same thing. A married put and call have the same profit and loss chart at the same strikes. The married put gives you flexiblity, because you can roll its strikes and/or sell the put, however more capital is required due to having to buy the shares (Unless you're using margin for the shares)Then again, you can short a put contract or buy/sell a put spread along with the LEAP for the same effect.Edit: Grammars",0,0.524,0.988,NEGATIVE

So, which is really better, the married put ( for this instance think 2 years) or the call LEAP?",The idea is to protect the cash needed for a qqq cash secured put in anticipation of a crash between now and maybe March. I don't like leaving all that cash just sitting around losing value. So I'm looking for the best way to utilize while keeping it safe in case I get assigned on the sold put.I intend on getting a LEAP too for it but that's in case it never crashes. Less capital up front while I can still have a married put on something else that should appreciate,1,0.519,0.999,NEGATIVE

You don't need to worry about assignment because you are holding the put and can sell it at any time.Selling a put and buying a call same strike and expiration is effectively buying 100 shares, as the profit and loss are the same.",2,0.522,0.998,POSITIVE

Ideally, I never get assigned and the market keeps rallying.I expect a choppy market to continue as we've seen this last week. I feel like we're going to be sideways in total return over the next couple of years as FED tightens back up and our GDP absorbs the losses from this year. The economy got shit on, it will be reflected eventually.",3,0.54,0.884,NEGATIVE
