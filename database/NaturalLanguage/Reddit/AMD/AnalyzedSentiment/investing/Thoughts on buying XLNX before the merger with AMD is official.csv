,"The title says it all really. I understand it as XLNX shareholders will get 1.73 shares of AMD once the merger is official (planned for end of 2021). I’m long on AMD and think this is a good opportunity, but curious what others think? Right now AMD valued at 90, you’re getting a bargain with XLNX shares but I also understand both stock prices can go down/up to the point where its no longer beneficial.

Thoughts?","It is common for a company acquiring another to offer a premium to induce the board and shareholders to agree to the merger. So the market price of the company being acquired will often spike upwards in response.The merger is not guaranteed to be completed. Various countries and various regulatory bodies must approve. So there is a risk that the merger won't happen. In that case the stock price is likely to sink back to near where it was when the merger was first announced, or perhaps just above the old price because the company is now ""in play"" and other merger or acquisition offers may materialize.The difference between the stock price and the price of the post-merger value is a reflection of that uncertainty. There may also be a small difference due to the company being acquired agreeing not to issue dividends prior to the merger.",0,0.576,1.0,NEGATIVE

Thoughts?","So I take this as it’s high risk/high reward. The risk is baked into the failure of the merger. Then your left holding a company you weren’t 100% on to begin with. BUT the other side of the coin is even if the price were to drop to the price of AMD and the merger goes through, it’s still worth it because you’re getting an additional .73 shares on each AMD share you own.Do you think there’s a high chance of merger not going through? Does that happen often?Appreciate the feedback.",1,0.555,0.955,POSITIVE

Thoughts?","I said tiny upside because your thesis for buying XLXN is the merger. If merger goes through, you have a tiny upside as the price of XLXN is reflecting a 95%+ chance that the merger goes through. Of course, if you're bullish on AMD, buying AMD would likely make more sense. Just my 2 cents",2,0.57,0.999,NEGATIVE

Thoughts?","With AMD at $92.50, XLNX merger value is $160. XLNX is currently trading at $140.60. That's a 14% discount (or 14% upside potential). Not tiny, IMO. If you're bullish on AMD and believe the deal will close, which looks likely, this is a good opportunity to acquire AMD at a discount.XLNX shareholders are entitled to 1.734 shares of AMD for each share of XLNX owned.",3,0.577,0.708,NEGATIVE
