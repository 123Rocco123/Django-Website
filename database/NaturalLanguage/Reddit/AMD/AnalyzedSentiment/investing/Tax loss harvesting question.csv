,"Is it considered a washed sale if I sell a losing investment such as uvxy and realize a capital gain by selling another stock such as my AMD stock, and then use the combined funds from the sale of both stocks to repurchase AMD stock within 30 days? Is there a name for that? Is that illegal? Will it incur any penalties come tax season?","Don't think of the dollars. Think -shares-.Did you sell some -shares- at a loss? Did you replace them within 30 days before or after?If ""Yes./Yes."", you have a wash sale. Doesn't matter how old the original shares were. Doesn't matter where the money came from. Doesn't matter if they're at a same or different brokerage.(Or my pet peeve: doesn't matter if the replacement shares came as a dividend reinvestment: still a wash sale.)",0,0.509,1.0,NEGATIVE

Is there a name for that? Is that illegal? Will it incur any penalties come tax season?","I thought a washed sale was when you sell an investment at a loss and then repurchase the same or substantially identical investment within 30 days before or after the sale?Uvxy and amd aren't substantially similar, right? And I'm not repurchasing losing shares, I'm repurchasing winning shares.So I'm not sure whether or not it's a Washed sale.",1,0.565,1.0,NEGATIVE

AMD has nothing to do with it.,4,0.537,1.0,NEGATIVE

The only thing substantially similar to UVXY is UVXY, maybe VIXY but that would be up to the IRS employee if they audit you.",2,0.52,0.999,NEGATIVE

Without AMD in the mix, you could subtract the loss from other dividends/capital gains first and then if you still have leftover losses, up to 3k against your regular earnings which may be a better deal for most people. Over 3k is carried over to the next year. Your mileage may vary.",0,0.565,1.0,NEGATIVE
