In this space, AMD is the undisputed champion.AMD ramped their first AI product (MI300X) from $0 to $5 billion in the first year. The hardware capability of the AI accelerator (most difficult challenge imo) is comparable or better than that of NVDA's H100. The main obstacles are matching the network and software stacks, both in which AMD has made significant strides. In my opinion, AMD is the closest to NVDA among all AI hardware companies",0,0.602,POSITIVE,0.999

Is there a strong bullish case for the company or is this becoming an Intel story?",AMD is the only competitor to Intel's CPUs. Look at market share of the global CPU industry. Hint: its a joke.78% is Intel13% is AMD8% is Apple.1% is other.With Intel fumbling and failing at every corner for the past 20 years its a matter of time before they lose market share. Apple exclusively produces and uses CPUs for their own tech so they're out. So either some <1% of market share company comes from absolutely nowhere or AMD takes over.In my mind with Intel failing AMD is purposely spending tons on capital to build up for a coming demand for CPUs that don't overheat and fail as often as all of Intel's newest CPUs. So their P/E might be crazy high but that's not necessarily a bad thing imo.AMD has been greatly improving all of their CPUs and Price to Performance beat Nvidia on a large section of GPUs. Nvidia might still be stronger so the industrial use of GPUs will remain dominated by Nvidia but the individual and potentially consumer products uses of GPUs have a lot of opportunity for AMD.,0,0.568,NEGATIVE,0.971

They've had a decade to take over against a company that does more things wrong than right, and haven't. I don't think it's a matter of time, I think that time has passed and unless AMD does something dramatically different (like convince smug CIOs that they make better chips than Intel so all these companies who have Intel-only purchasing rules will buy AMD), it's just not going to happen.The only thing that's going to have AMD taking over the desktop and server CPU market at this point is Intel literally not making chips.",1,0.574,NEGATIVE,1.0

People were buying Intel CPUs not b/c they were the best but b/c they were Intel. Companies like dell,hp, etc would use Intel CPUs b/c it’s Intel. Only recently has Amd started making a cut into those markets. And as bad as Intel has been for a decade 2024 has been by far their worst year.

The newest generation of CPUs is running on a new architecture that is at best on par with the previous generation while being generally more expensive.  The board just ""retired"" Pat Gelsinger out of the blue without a new CEO selected.  IFS is so far behind that even the Intel design teams are going to TSMC for many products.Just about the only spot of good news for Intel at the moment is the release of the Battlemage series of GPUs, which might be enough for them to gain a foothold in consumer if the marketing slides are to be believed.

The thing about tech stocks is that is that they never grow based on current financial metrics, but future expectations.P/E ratio is already an inherently terrible metric for valuation of a company since balance sheets can easily be manipulated with accounting.And people saying its only so high right now because of the amortization of their recent acquisition is high, but I call that a bullshit argument, because its the same speculation as always (that is assuming that acquisition will generate revenue more than the cost of the asset, but this is a big unknown, hence why its P/E is still high).",0,0.564,NEGATIVE,1.0
