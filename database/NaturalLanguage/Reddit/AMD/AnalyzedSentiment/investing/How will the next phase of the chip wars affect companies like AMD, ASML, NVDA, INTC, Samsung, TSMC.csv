Which are ... insulators... Most heat is dissipated by bulk so that layer would have to be really sparse to not melt itself which limits usefulness.If you are talking bonding two dies together you still have an issue which you can only attach a heatsink the bulk side of only one die, so the other die needs to not generate as much heat which can dissipate through the PCB/socket/motherboard/interposer...or other possible packaging situation.

It will greatly reduce flexibility architects have in deciding what goes where and which structures and materials are used. But ultimately it won't affect how cooling works, apart from the importance of active thermal control systems.Seeing how manufacturers solve these issues will indeed be very interesting, although at the same time understanding design decisions and quality will become much much harder. Ultimately it will limit how much we can learn about products, companies and the techniques used by looking at their products - something I think is a bad thing in a sector already very difficult to understand, especially for investors. For analysis we'll increasingly have to rely on leaks, which already are quite problematic at this point because certain rumors already seem almost as important as real world test results for perceived quality in some cases.I say no difference because I think there'll be no practical implications for cooling in the sense how chips are cooled. Now that I think about it I think it will be the end of overclocking and therefore maybe even advanced cooling system like liquid coolants unless it becomes viable to design chips especially for those environments. Imagine the amount of sensors you'd need with stacked cores for a thermal control system to ensure workloads don't interfere with eachother in an overclocked system: it's not like you can model how future devs will optimize their workload to target specific capabilities of your cores and therefore you'd need a sensor close to your weak points for active thermal management to work.",4,0.516,0.999,NEGATIVE
