,"Before I start, i'd like to ask: is there some kind of app where I can see the stock charts of those I put on a ""watchlist""? There are stocks on my watch list where I am keeping an eye on for the chance to invest. But for mobile apps like Vanguard, I can't see the individual stock charts of those on my watch list like AMD, TGT, and VOO. So each time I wonder how they are doing I have to look them up individually. I've been thinking about making a mobile app or web app for those stock charts. Like the one on google where you can see the whole graph for all the way up to ""Max"". Just a simple app that takes up half a screen on the desktop if it were on a pc or an app on the phone. I'm not looking to become the next Bill Gates or something, I just want to help the community if they are struggling like me in this aspect.","Hi, welcome to r/investing.
