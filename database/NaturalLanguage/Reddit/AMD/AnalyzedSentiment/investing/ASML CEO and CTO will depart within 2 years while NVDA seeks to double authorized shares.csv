,"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery. Recruitement is looking outside the organisation for board members. I found this after reading that Nvidia seeks approval to double authorized shares to 8 billion. The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split. I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.
