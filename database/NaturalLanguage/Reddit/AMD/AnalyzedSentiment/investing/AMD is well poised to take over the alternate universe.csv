You could buy 100 shares for $15000. Alternatively, you could buy a single long-dated (1-2 years out) AMD call (option to buy 100 shares) with a $70 strike price for somewhere around $8100.For every $1 increase in price, the value of the shares and the option increases by $100, so you get the same 'gains' but you would have put up much less money to buy the call option.The cost of this leverage is the extrinsic-value ( of the option premium, this is the total option cost (say $81) minus the intrinsic value ($150 [share price] - $70[strike price] = $80) times 100 = $100.So you're effectively paying $100 in interest to borrow $8000, which is a very cheap interest rate.The main downsides of doing this are:* you don't collect dividends since you don't own the shares* extrinsic-value (and therefor interest rate) is higher when stock is volatile (such as after a significant drop or after recent good news), which is often when people buy* when the option starts nearing expiration, you have to either sell them and pay taxes on the gains (if in a taxable account), or exercise them and fork up the $70x100 = $7000 to buy the shares outright.",2,0.55,0.998,NEGATIVE

The option holder needs the stock to go up by $1 (in the example) just to break even.The other consideration is liquidity (bid-ask spread). The further in-the-money the option is, the wider the bid-ask spread typically is. If the call option is nearing expiration, your choices are to either exercise the option (fork up the remaining $70[strike price]x100 = $7000 to buy the shares) or sell to close the option.

The option holder needs the stock to go up by $1 (in the example) just to break even.The other consideration is liquidity (bid-ask spread). The further in-the-money the option is, the wider the bid-ask spread typically is. If the call option is nearing expiration, your choices are to either exercise the option (fork up the remaining $70[strike price]x100 = $7000 to buy the shares) or sell to close the option. If option liquidity is low and you don't have the cash on hand to buy the shares, you may have to lower the sell price to find a buyer, cutting into profits.There is usually plenty of liquidity for popular stocks, but if you're looking to use this to increase leverage on index fund investing, then it can be harder.
