The things that I do not like, thus far, are the outstanding share count and the share price at launch. The fees are a bit high, but tolerable considering there are people actively adjusting the fund to market conditions. Now the things that I do like are the YIELD (!), NAV, NAV increases, and the covered call strategies.JEPQ really changed my portfolio performance more than any other fund in the last 7 years and I believe the market is going to be sideways for many years. So, covered call and other income generating strategies are a ""must have"" within ETFs for me from now on. The time for QQQ and SCHD was ten years ago.",0,0.538,0.998,POSITIVE

So I assume it’s a dynamic strike based on market conditions and news.No changed strategy in a downturn that I am aware of. But JEPQ generated HUGE income during the 2022 downturn due to collecting all premiums and higher IV. FEPI would do the same.Since they are selling OTM calls they would also capture most of the upside in the recovery, except possibly for a 2020 style V shaped recovery from a catastrophic event, which is pretty unlikely anytime soon.

For the past couple of years holding positions in JEPI, JEPQ and SVOL have fulfilled their purposes of capital preservation while generating sufficient monthly dividends. FEPI now allows me to get more done with less invested.
