,"AMZN vs AAPL And AMD vs NVDA To me all of these are solid stocks, but if you personally had to pick only one from each group which ones do you believe have higher growth potential over the next 5 to 10 years? I already have a stake in all of these companies, but I’m looking to figure how to allocate new investing money other than a simple equal division Thoughts?",I would go Amazon over Apple because I see Amazon doing many more things and disrupting more industries so they have a lot of growth potential.Nvidia over AMD. Have used both of their products and they are both just wonderful and it is very hard to pick clear winner. I have had slightly better experience with Nvidia so I believe that they can attract more customers. I guess this really comes down to slight bias that I see a lot more Nvidia products around me compared to AMD.I would honestly like all of these but you made me choose.,0,0.558,0.718,NEGATIVE

However, NVDA and AMD make 2 completely different products. You need both CPU and GPU for a pc or any computer system to run. A better comparison would be TSM vs INTC vs AMD.

And they haven't really experienced multiple expansion like AMD, AMZN, AAPL, and NVDA.Intel is extremely undervalued for the business they do. They are losing market share in the consumer base but server market share still remains 95%. I'm much more comfortable investing in with them who make $20B net income & ~10 P/E over AMD. These companies you mentioned are riding in extremely high multiples and for them to maintain that for 5-10 years is more than challenging.All great companies but they already priced at high growth.

Apple has felt pretty stagnant lately and, as an Apple user, I don’t see anything that truly separates them from competition outside of better personal security, which is becoming almost impossible to ensure nowadays. They have been very reliant on a field that has a lot of competition and little noteworthy change.Amazon feels like the opposite. They’ve got so much that they own but I don’t know if enough of it is proprietary for them to keep their value if a challenger comes along. And then there’s investments like Prime gaming, which I can only see increase the cost for regular members while offering another service not many people wanted from them. I’d be curious if they can maintain a reasonable price if they keep expanding their services.Doubt they’re going anywhere, but would agree with you I can’t imagine either is going to be keep ahead of the market indefinitely, as new competitors come in.",1,0.529,0.998,NEGATIVE

At current valuation, cannot justify adding to that position. But AAPL has the most powerful brand in the world. It's incredible. People can't switch anymore. I have been Android last ten years. I am switching to iPhone this winter. Their moat is unreal compared to Samsung and Huawei. AAPL is the only phone company that makes +20% margins on phones.My bet was on AMZN over Apple but AWS growth will be what, 5-10% in 10 years. Retail side is all they got. God knows how many acquisitions they have every year. One of those might be the next AWS. Same thing with Apple. They are both certainly too big to fail for the next five years.Amazon buys all competitors and new services but they don't capitalize off it like Apple. They are as bad a Google with acquisitions. Apple is one of the best with inorganic growth, but I can't really pick one over the other now.I just can't justify buying either now. I want to own ADBE and NVDA too. But valuations on all of them don't make any sense. I rather own companies with lower downside and lower expected growth rates, which at any moment, can hit a catalyst and expand their multiple like AAPL, AMZN, NVDA, and AMD has done.",2,0.546,0.784,NEGATIVE

I’m seeing comparisons to IBM - they will still be around but a minor player. I’m just not convinced that AMD will swallow Intel’s market share based on Intel’s 7nm chip delay. AMD bulls also mention Intel’s poor management and weak workforce - see other threads referring to Intel employees with limited technical knowledge.,1,0.555,1.0,NEGATIVE

I like AMD better than Intel as a company. But price is what you pay and value is what you get. Lisa Su is so much better than Intel's CEO. But you have to look at the power (supplier and spending) that Intel commands in the market. No one comes close except TSM.Intel 10nm is close to AMD 7nm which is in fact TSM manufactures. Intel is only USA/Western designer, manufacture, and distributor left. That adds a moat most people ignore. It's America's golden child. Politics work in their favor too. Lastly, Intel poached AMDs and NVDAs people this year. I can't think of a more well capitalized company at that price. I would recommend listening to Value Investing with Legends with Polen capital. Great listen.AMD is a better company but Intel has more value and upside. I'm not paying a 100x multiple on a company with my fund. Intel and AMD have traded market share for the last 50 years.

Amazon has more flexibility and is ruthless in expanding overseas to explain labor in places like India. No true competitors and has a low overhead. AAPL runs off innovation and relies on convincing people there product is different from their competition when it's really not. AAPL is to overvalue right now but has upside potential due to it's management team (seriously these guys kick ass).AMD due to it's ebitda, P/E, and product line. The new chipset is going to be in the Xbox and with the recent aquisition of Bethesda by Microsoft there is going to be a big sale of consols and AMD chips. Further, AMD is a smaller company and has more room to grow. NVDA has kinda saturated their market and is reliant upon big outside investment to move fast.Hedge with AMD and go into AMZN.

If they don't get services off the ground, I don't see much growth.Moreover AAPL isn't the innovative company it once was. For example, it clearly dropped the ball on services ... They basically had the market with iTunes, but let Spotify and Netflix eat their lunch.
