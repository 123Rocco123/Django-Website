It's not going to be worth 0 because it's supposedly only going up to $125. Do you just not know how options work? You made a bet that it will go up, and it will likely jump up tomorrow by a higher than usual %... Profit",0,0.538,1.0,NEGATIVE

The value of the option goes up on the stocks likelihood to cross 130, which may very well be zero now.There may still be some buy orders that someone will regret making ""Good til cancelled"", but nobody would be out there looking to buy this option for more tomorrow.",1,0.543,1.0,NEGATIVE

There's no confirmation that the deal is done, hell, the info wasn't even released by either company at the time, it was just reports of supposed talks.

A merger is announced, the stock goes up, it can go up more. It could be rebid for a higher takeover price. It could come out that they discovered a new widget that makes them double their current revenue.It will probably only affect the implied volatility, but since the price went up, the rational options price also goes up.",0,0.545,0.995,NEGATIVE
