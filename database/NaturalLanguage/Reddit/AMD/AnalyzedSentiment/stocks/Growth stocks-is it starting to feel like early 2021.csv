,"Edit-early 2022. I understand no one has a crystal ball. I understand the market can remain irrational longer than I can remain solvent. Back in early 2021, it seemed like growth stocks could only go up, and even though stock prices were at irrationally high levels, I remember telling myself 'time in the market beats timing the market' ' literally the week before growth stocks took a 50% + beating and would trend down for a year. I recognise that I partially lucked out, selling my falling knives and buying back into companies like NVDA sub 150, meta sub 100 etc. Most of my investments were in an S&P500 tracker, which obviously had a much gentler fall. I currently hold £61k in individual stocks in an account I've sworn to not add money to, and £110k in S&P500 etf that I add £1-2k monthly. I'm 31 and still have my highest earning years ahead of me, as a surgeon. Were you in my position, would you just sell most of my Mag 7 positions + AMD and move it into SP500 etf?",But to be honest: So many small-caps are still like 50-90 % down from their ATH.,0,0.506,0.998,NEGATIVE

That’s too important to the Nasdaq, while ARKK type stocks aren’t as important.But as of now at least, there’s nothing to say that the Nasdaq may be topping on a longer term basis (other than the dynamic I mentioned above).

BYND also got to $234, now sits at $6.That period was really anything ""disruptive"" got taken to ridiculous levels. This is much more focused (ai) and less absurd but feeling increasingly overcrowded and ""stocks only go up"" for that set of beneficiaries.Bireme's recent letter offers a summary: ""The Magnificent 7 and their ilk still have transcendent businesses. However, they no longer have very reasonable valuations. Given today’s unprecedented concentration (the top 8 companies make up more than 30% of the S&P 500), the fortunes of the major equity indices – and the fortunes of hundreds of millions of Americans via their retirement savings and pensions – are increasingly tied to the performance of a few increasingly overextended stocks."" (https://www.biremecapital.com/blog/december-2023-investor-letter)I have trimmed tech quite a bit recently (a lower % allocation to tech than the S&P for the first time in memory, not a large % lower, but lower) but am absolutely not selling all of it and probably am at the point where I don't see selling any further. I don't dislike tech, I want to like tech more at this point, the issue becomes trying to find something that doesn't feel as if it's been a part of a buying frenzy. Even the ""tech adjacent"" names that I own (VRT) have become crowded.Definitely not shorting tech, maybe will look to rebuy if things correct soon but otherwise just simply looking for opportunities elsewhere.",0,0.518,1.0,NEGATIVE

CD's and savings accounts with some banks are paying north of 5% as well (FDIC insured). Some Corporate bonds have even higher yields. If the Fed starts to drop rates in 2024, this will benefit the bond portfolio even more.I tend to like stocks with a great track record of paying and raising their dividends. Especially companies that virtually everyone uses - utilities, water, trash, personal hygiene, energy, and others. It is not unrealistic to get 6 - 7% returns just from the dividends.

I currently hold £61k in individual stocks in an account I've sworn to not add money to, and £110k in S&P500 etf that I add £1-2k monthly. I'm 31 and still have my highest earning years ahead of me, as a surgeon. Were you in my position, would you just sell most of my Mag 7 positions + AMD and move it into SP500 etf?",I used to do valuation and I still do it in my free time here and thereThe problem I keep running into is that the expectations for margin growth are unrealistic and I feel like the market is probably 10% overvalued.I’ve been pretty bullish historically but so many companies are overvalued right now.,0,0.529,0.999,NEGATIVE
