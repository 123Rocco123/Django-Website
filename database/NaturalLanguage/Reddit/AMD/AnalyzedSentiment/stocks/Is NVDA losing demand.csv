Isn’t less potential China demand good for our US based companies and NVDA?","I've recently read a bear case for NVDA.. or at least some miss-steps they've made. I'll try to summarize without screwing it up too bad.NVDA has high demand for their AI chips, everyone already knows. But the miss step is that they chose to sell the chips to start-ups that they have a stake in, rather than market leaders like Google, Meta, and Amazon. These companies that they shafted are very cash rich and capable of developing their own solutions. Basically, their decision to allocate to the start ups may have indirectly created competitors/ enemies out of these mega caps instead of having them as harmless, paying customers.The US government is trying to limit AI chips being brought into China largely for military reasons. China is building a large ambitious military force. US is worried powerful AI chips will be used in weapon systems, drones, and so on. So basically China found a workaround the export rules... with the help of NVDA. So in my first example NVDA made a powerful enemy in the mega caps. And now they have potentially pissed off the US government by circumventing the rules to help China and themselves.Thoughts?Source- Colin Tedards- The Bleeding Edge newsletter.",0,0.526,0.999,NEGATIVE

That's simply how it works.Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, all the tech giants have a long history of making hardware products from amazon basics stuff to quantum computers, google glasses, 3d visors, hardware accelerators, servers, custom networking solutions...Regardless of how Nvidia allocated their GPUs the tech giants were going to produce their hardware regardless.It should also be noted that producing GPUs is overall simpler than producing other kind of chips those tech giants designed already.",1,0.528,0.984,NEGATIVE

So tell me why there is so much consternation about NVDA? Isn’t less potential China demand good for our US based companies and NVDA?","Heard the same kind of vague doomsaying into the last two quarters.First of those quarters, NVDA reported record smashing sales and massive order backlog like never before. They guided up, not down.So for the next quarter, the doomsaying doubled down and... NVDA reported even more staggering record breaking sales and unprecedented huge demand. Just before the quiet period, a BOD member let it slip that nvidia doesn't even need China and they'll still have years of full price waiting list demand. Along with the best ER in company history, they gave massive increase to guidance.Market response? It's down 20% since that information reveal. You're basically getting a 20% discount and it's like knowing the ER ahead of time.For those saying P/E is high, sure it is. But E is heading north, so even if the market cap goes up, NVDA might actually be getting cheaper.Nvidia has every incentive to join the doomers and provide excuse and fear based guidance. Look like geniuses if they somehow avoid the disastrous ERs of sister companies. But they're not. And it doesn't seem like the blind hubris of Blackberry or Paypal executives.Some of the NVDA doomsaying is reminiscent of ""META going to zero because they're fixated on 3D googles and people are abandoning their platforms"" or ""NFLX is going to zero because people are over it"" or ""Google now obsolete as everyone will switch to BingGPT."" There was even the 70% NVDA selloff when the market decided GPU demand for crypto and gaming was dying.Steve Eisner (one of The Big Short permabears) continues to predict market implosion on the daily, but there's one stock he won't short: NVDA. He said he met with NVDA's Jensen Huang a few weeks ago and he's never met a more ""calmly confident"" CEO in his life.Despite all of the above, market sentiment can overrule what I'm saying or what you're saying.",1,0.545,0.999,NEGATIVE

Isn’t less potential China demand good for our US based companies and NVDA?","You should look at NVDA revenue and see how closely tied it is to the startups they funded buying their chips. I think almost all the bump in Q2 was from those 2 startups. One got so much funding they just turned it around and bought chips. The other, I believe, for cash loans against the chips and used that cash to buy chips they hadn’t actually received yet.NVDA might be recognizing revenue before it’s realized. They did it before.What’s suspicious to me is why there was no ramp up. Revenue was declining from the Covid GPU pop and then in one quarter they do $3 billion more than the trend would suggest. Large companies plan out large moves 6 quarters in advance because they need board approval for several billion dollar expenditures. The Q1 revenue looked at about pre Covid levels then Q2 was a blowout. You would have seen a ramp up last year and not all that spending would have happened in one quarter.",1,0.534,1.0,NEGATIVE

And a larger portion went to these startups, which NVDA is invested in.The scenario I was trying to paint was that google doesn’t want to wait around for the scraps.

Also every time I tried my ""are we there yet"" test of running my projects on an AMD, the answer has been no due to missing implementations or fallbacks that have unacceptable performance implications. Since the status has been the same for about 5 years, I do not assume that there is enough genuine effort to close the gap from AMD. It's sad, because it feels like it's almost there, but almost is not good enough. You can downvote me all you like, but clearly my stance is shared by the industry.And then you have to consider that any new development happens on cuda. Many cutting edge projects need to implement their own ops, and that turns out to be problematic more often than not.HIPIFY is not in an ""it just works"" state. Pytorch ""sorta works"" on AMD (with the occasional unimplemented op). Good chunk of industry is also stuck on Tensorflow for either historical reasons or lock-in reasons (e.g. Google is never going to realistically move away from their own implementations due to in house hardware that needs to be supported, and they do not run any AMD cards at all), and that has never supported AMD at all.

If NVIDIA didn't operate with the arrogance and bravado that they do, people might have put up with it and let NVIDIA enter that space but now that's not going to happen. NVIDIA will be iced out on the software side.On the hardware side, LLM will be around for a while but the models will eventually aggregate... and before that, publicly available models will be sufficient for most companies. The REAL MONEY is in Inference. Inference will require lots of differentiated hardware IP because it will be at a cell tower, a clothing store, automobiles, factories, desktop, laptop, Server, security... just everywhere.

Their ARM CPU is only good for low power and very limited server processes... it might as well be worthless, in my opinion, but people will disagree.So, NVIDIA will what?... go SAAS, limit hardware, get hit with a lawsuit for anticompetitive practices, all while incentiving the cloud providers and others to avoid them at all costs. Then as they get ran out of the software game, they'll remain competitive with their GPU, ARM CPU, and NVLink? ... the last 2 of which can easily be copied or replicated.AMD's IP with IF combined with their patents on memory addressing to integrate CPU, GPU, NIC, FPGA and ASIC... mixed in with the IP Xilinx brought in for FPGA memory blocks...

So, who makes NVDA's chips?World’s largest chipmaker TSMC sees biggest drop in profit in nearly five yearsPUBLISHED THU, OCT 19 20232:00 AM EDT CNBCThe Taiwanese chipmaker is the top producer of the world’s most advanced processors, but demand for consumer electronics has plunged.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (ticker: TSM) reported revenue slipped 10.83% from a year ago, while net income fell 24.87% from a year ago to $17.28 billion. That compares with TSMC’s guidance for third-quarter revenue between $16.7 billion and $17.5 billion.During the earnings call on Thursday afternoon, CEO C.C. Wei said that the firm expects excess inventories to continue to decline.“Due to the persistent weaker overall macroeconomic conditions and slow demand in China, customers remain cautious in their inventory control. That’s why we expect the inventory oversupply to continue in the fourth quarter,” said Wei.TSMC is the top producer of the world’s most advanced processors. The Taiwanese firm manufactures semiconductors for companies like Apple, and Nvidia.*Why Is The Semiconductor Industry Prone To Boom And Bust Cycles?The semiconductor industry is prone to boom and bust cycles due to a variety of factors:Capital Spending Ups and Downs: The industry’s cycles are often driven by changes in capital spending. When demand for a product increases, manufacturers expand capacity aggressively. However, this can lead to an oversupply if demand decreases or stabilizes.Process Migration Glitches: The transition to new manufacturing processes can cause disruptions in the supply chain, leading to periods of oversupply or shortage.Demand Slowdowns: Changes in demand for consumer products that use semiconductors can also cause these cycles. For example, insatiable demand for a product – such as PCs in the 1980s, mobile phones in the 2000s, and smartphones in the 2010s – would lead manufacturers to aggressively expand capacity.Inventory and Economic Growth: The industry cycles are also driven by inventory as well as world economic growth.However, some experts believe that the semiconductor industry’s boom-bust cycle might be changing due to diversified demand from various sectors like cell phones, automobiles, industrial equipment, cloud computing, and more. This diversified demand and the increasing cost of supply might lead to a steadier business going forward.Biggest boom cycle in semiconductor industryThe biggest boom cycle in the semiconductor industry, as per Deutsche Bank Research, began in October 2019 and has been running for 29 months, which is already above the historical average of 27.7 months. This boom cycle has been driven by various factors such as the demand for chips throughout the economy, including 5G, cloud datacenters, phones, PCs, laptops, and cars. The semiconductor industry has generally done pretty well over the last two or three years with the current chip shortage.Will AI lead to another boom cycle for the semiconductor industry?AI impact on semiconductor industryArtificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to lead to another boom cycle in the semiconductor industry. AI applications are everywhere, from big data analytics and military equipment to facial recognition software and self-driving cars. They bring new challenges and opportunities to the semiconductor industry every day.AI has the potential to generate huge business value for semiconductor companies at every step of their operations, from research and chip design to production through sales. However, only about 30 percent of semiconductor-device makers are already generating revenue through AI/ML.AI could allow semiconductor companies to grow in value, with storage experiencing the highest growth. The AI-spurred semiconductor market is set to grow by 18 percent over the next five years.However, it’s important to note that while AI is creating new opportunities, it also brings challenges. For example, the amount of data processed and stored by AI applications is massive, requiring architectural improvements in semiconductors. Also, it’s costly to manufacture a specialized AI chip for every application.In conclusion, while AI is likely to drive growth in the semiconductor industry, how this will unfold depends on various factors including how quickly companies can adapt and innovate in response to these new demands and challenges.Would it be better to invest in INTC, NVDA or the SMH ETF?Investing in individual stocks or an ETF depends on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s some information that might help you:Intel Corporation (INTC):The stock closed at $35.97.The average 12-month stock price forecast is $34.45, which predicts a decrease of -4.23%.The earnings per share (EPS) estimate for the current year (2023) is $0.62 and for the next year (2024) is $1.741. The revenue estimate for the current year (2023) is $52.48B and for the next year (2024) is $58.66B.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA):The stock closed at $454.613. NVIDIA has received a consensus rating of Moderate Buy.Is NVIDIA stock overbought now?NVIDIA stock overbought analysisYes, according to some analysts, NVIDIA’s stock is considered overbought. The term “overbought” refers to a situation where an asset has been more aggressively bought than its fundamentals justify. Overbought conditions can last for a while, but they often precede reversals or pullbacks in the price. However, it’s important to note that being overbought doesn’t necessarily mean the price will go down immediately.VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH):The ETF closed at $148.81.It’s based on the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 index, a market-cap-weighted index of 25 of the largest US-listed semiconductors companies. It has holdings in both Intel and NVIDIA, among others.Remember, it’s important to do your own research and due diligence (DD) before making any investment decisions.",1,0.559,0.997,NEGATIVE

A lot of people have rightfully pointed out that NVDA can't produce enough to meet demand, and have at minimum a 6 month backlog (likely closer to a year) to fill.The part not being mentioned is that a lot of these companies rely on the same suppliers (TSMC is the one most people know about because they manufacture the actual silicon, but there are a lot of other companies in the supply chain as well). NVDA has taken a pretty aggressive step and locked in ~1 year of supply ahead of time to maintain production of H100 and upcoming H200. Specifically, they've booked up a majority of SoIC capacity available (chiplet production). This causes issues for other companies looking to compete (mostly AMD, as they have the most similar product in the MI300) because even if they wanted to produce more, the capacity simply doesn't exist because NVDA already ate it up. This is similar to how Apple basically monopolizes the leading node to produce its A-series chips, and no one else really has significant access until Apple's run is complete.So yeah, several companies large and small are building competitive silicon.
