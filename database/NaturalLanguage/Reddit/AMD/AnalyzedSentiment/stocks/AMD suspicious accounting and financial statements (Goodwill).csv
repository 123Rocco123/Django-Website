,"AMD has 48 billion non tangible assets (goodwill)! This is a huge red flag/risk that the people who buy into it completely ignore yet it's so easy to spot in prima vista. This goodwill wasn't on the financial statements in 2021, so it has nothing to do with the fame of AMD - it has entirely to do with a recent acquisition that they had of Xilinx. The question every intelligent investor should ask himself is if they seriously payed billions for goodwill alone and not actual assets of the company they acquired? For comparison Coca-Cola is one of the most known companies in the world yet being twice more expensive their goodwill is only 33 billion. I don't find any excuse how a company can get 48 billion goodwill assets in a single year just like that, besides it actually doing accounting shenanigans (scam). I am looking at the latest financial statement of Xilinx here https://investor.xilinx.com/node/18946/html and I don't see any huge assets/goodwill. I haven't done a great research about this goodwill, but considering that AMD is not more famous in 2023 than it was in 2021 I don't see any reasoning for it's absurdly high goodwill and PE ratio :). Such financial tricks were being done back in the dot-com bubble and it was easy to spot when a company inflated it's assets via accounting tricks and illegal/bad practices (several great examples were covered in The Intelligent Investor). Where is the due diligence of the people buying into AMD? To put it in other words Benjamin Graham and his disciples would never touch this company even with a stick! The only way I could explain this is that they simply had no time to properly organize the Xilinx acquisition in terms of accounting and decided to put everything into Goodwill... But this can be considered still a fraud, no? If I am at wrong at the accounting is fine how come Xilinx had only 48 billion in goodwill and nothing more? Are you telling me they had 0 machinery, 0 chips, 0 equipment whatsoever?! I see they had 5.5 billion in assets in 2021, but there is no way they had 48 billion goodwill! I think I haven't even heard about them till digging about this AMD goodwill. And I have heard about Texas Instruments many times.","Goodwill only comes about during acquisitions. It’s the difference between purchase price of the company and the company’s accounting book value. There’s lots of reasons why a company would pay more than the company’s book value.In your example with Coca Cola, the Xilinx acquisition was 10x the size of cokes largest ever acquisition.This isn’t a huge red flag you just don’t know what you’re talking about.",0,0.558,0.995,NEGATIVE

You are parroting definitions but it's clear it's not 100%.Don't worry, many mess it up. I don't have the whole thing down.But goodwill can come from a lot of things, the concern isn't that you paid more than book cost for assets, leaving you with goodwill. It's that those assets won't perform like you thought.Infact, those assets NEED to be checked to see if they must be written down/off semi regularly for tax purposes. If audited it can be a disaster and cause delays.So I'm guessing since you made this post and are arguing about simple concepts that you ran these asset tests...What did the asset tests show?

Here some advice to you--don't be looking for reasons to support your short position after it has gone wrong, unless those were the reasons you initiated the short position in the first place.Also shorting against market sentiment may take a long time to produce a profit. In the mean time you get frustrated by sitting on unrealized losses that can be substantial. But at least you should be collecting short sale interest instead of paying.Lastly, you are misinterpreting AMD's goodwill number. As others have pointed out, it's merely the difference between purchase price and assets purchased. This is pretty straightforward in AMD's case. AMD wasn't reclassifying stuff on one end of the balance sheet to another.edit: one last piece of suggestion - shorting is asymmetrically more risky than rewarding. A stock can only fall 100% and it is an unlikely event unless it's company going bankrupt, but by that time the shorting costs will so high that the position will not be worth it. However, it can easily 20+% gain with no upper limit.My suggestion is if you want to gamble for home run, to wait for sudden large market drops and enter into short duration calls.",2,0.548,1.0,NEGATIVE

For any company, it is FORBIDDEN to activate their own goodwill. Thus, Cola can not activate or show their own goodwill, the goodwill of the brand. Same for all others and AMD as well as Xilinx. This is why both balance sheets had no significant goodwill before. This means the goodwill in the balance sheet can only be generated by an acquisition, but not by AMD or Xilinx themselves. Thos acquisition was Xilinx. It is well known that Xilinx holds a few patents. Now, how would you measure the value of patents in the future? You might end up with more than 40bn. Everybody is talking about. Merger, acquisition, concentration, and growth. Consequently, this generates goodwill.",0,0.556,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"AMD has 48 billion non tangible assets (goodwill)! This is a huge red flag/risk that the people who buy into it completely ignore yet it's so easy to spot in prima vista. This goodwill wasn't on the financial statements in 2021, so it has nothing to do with the fame of AMD - it has entirely to do with a recent acquisition that they had of Xilinx. The question every intelligent investor should ask himself is if they seriously payed billions for goodwill alone and not actual assets of the company they acquired? For comparison Coca-Cola is one of the most known companies in the world yet being twice more expensive their goodwill is only 33 billion. I don't find any excuse how a company can get 48 billion goodwill assets in a single year just like that, besides it actually doing accounting shenanigans (scam). I am looking at the latest financial statement of Xilinx here https://investor.xilinx.com/node/18946/html and I don't see any huge assets/goodwill. I haven't done a great research about this goodwill, but considering that AMD is not more famous in 2023 than it was in 2021 I don't see any reasoning for it's absurdly high goodwill and PE ratio :). Such financial tricks were being done back in the dot-com bubble and it was easy to spot when a company inflated it's assets via accounting tricks and illegal/bad practices (several great examples were covered in The Intelligent Investor). Where is the due diligence of the people buying into AMD? To put it in other words Benjamin Graham and his disciples would never touch this company even with a stick! The only way I could explain this is that they simply had no time to properly organize the Xilinx acquisition in terms of accounting and decided to put everything into Goodwill... But this can be considered still a fraud, no? If I am at wrong at the accounting is fine how come Xilinx had only 48 billion in goodwill and nothing more? Are you telling me they had 0 machinery, 0 chips, 0 equipment whatsoever?! I see they had 5.5 billion in assets in 2021, but there is no way they had 48 billion goodwill! I think I haven't even heard about them till digging about this AMD goodwill. And I have heard about Texas Instruments many times.","So major companies can't value their reputation, patents etc. as non-tangible assets on their balance sheet anymore?",1,0.524,0.993,NEGATIVE

Patents is more difficult, as it is possible to activate the cost. But the cost usually are far different from the value. The cost for developping covid vaccines are nothing in comparison to the revenue derived from the patent. So, yes it is not possible to show the fair value of a patent.
