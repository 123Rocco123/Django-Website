,"Taiwan Semiconductor is trading at a P/E ratio of 15. ASML, a similarly important semiconductor company who is also the global leader in its respective field commands a P/E of 37. Nvidia, and AMD also trade at far higher multiples despite being largely dependent on TSM for chips. The reason TSM is so cheap compared to these other companies is because of the geopolitical risks associated with investing in a Taiwanese company. However, this risk is way overstated on many levels. 1. China invading Taiwan is nowhere near a certainty. 2. TSM is building manufacturing plants outside of Taiwan including in Arizona. 3. Most importantly if China were to invade Taiwan, the entire stock market would drop off a cliff. US involvement and concerns over nuclear war would hit all non military stocks. In that situation TSM probably falls like 70% but the rest of the market may drop by 30%. Buying a company trading at half its market value is entirely worth it if the biggest risk is that it would lose an extra 40% in value in the event of WW3 starting. I don’t know about y’all, but I’d be more worried about getting drafted then I would about my portfolio underperforming the market. Investing in TSM is like getting 2/1 odds that WW3 won’t happen in the next 10 years. If you win you double your money. If you lose, the money is the least of your concerns.","If you actually just look at the history of Chinese aggression(or lack thereof), it becomes obvious that it doesn't matter if China actually invades Taiwan - all that matters is that people think they potentially will. The CCP has been proclaming thier intent to invade Taiwan since the 1950's. I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will continue to do so for the forseeable future, and thus TSMC's p/e ratio will remain at a discount relative to most of thier peers. You're only going to get paid that multibagger if you can convince others the risk of China invading is gone.",0,0.509,0.998,NEGATIVE

Nevertheless, the threat of Chinese aggression does rise and fall over time. This is especially true in the eyes of the market. There will definitely be times in the future when the threat is far lower in Wall Street’s eyes than it is right now resulting in a significantly higher multiple.

Remember you're calculating their PE ratio based on the peak of the cycle, and the stock price is looking towards the decline part of their cycle. You want to invest when their valuation is high (because earnings are at the trough of the cycle) and the cycle is beginning to boom.If you reduce their earnings by 30% (as per their -29% YoY guidance), PE goes up from 14 to 20.Another factor is that earnings is just an accounting figure - includes depreciation which was spent 5 years ago, and it doesn't factor in expenditure today.Their Q1 2018 capex was 2.5bn.Their Q1 2023 depreciation is 3.6bn.Their Q1 2023 capex is 9.93bn. This means higher depreciation charge going forward which reduces EPS.Their Q1 FCF = 2.7bn which is well below their net income of 6.8bn.There is not a chance in hell their capex is ever going to go back to 2.5bn.Their FCF for the last 4 quarters is 16.1bn, which gives a P/FCF ratio of 27.9.For comparison, ASML's capex in 2018 (full year) only increased from 0.60bn EUR to 1.32bn EUR.ASML's P/FCF ratio is 31.5 which is not that much higher than TSM's P/FCF.ASML's guidanceQ2 2023 (guidance in USD) Q2 2022Revenue ~7.02 - 7.56bn (27.8% YoY) 5.7bnOperating Margin 30% (no change) 30%Operating Profit 2.1 - 2.27bn (26% YoY) 1.73bnASML expects full year 2023 sales to be 25% greater than 2022.Unless TSM's guidance is really bad and they out deliver massively, it's clear that they are NOT cheap when looking at their negative revenue growth expectations and lagging earnings numbers due to their capex increasing 4x in 5 years.ASML is justifiably valued higher as their revenue growth is still intact and capex has only increased 2-3x. (Reminder that TSM's higher capex is good for ASML, since they're one of ASML's customers).",0,0.556,0.999,NEGATIVE

However, aren’t those guidance numbers just reflecting the massive backlog/chip shortage issues of last year. Companies over ordered last year so they expect a slowdown this year which should moderate out over the following years.Even with the recent decline their price is up 390% over the last ten years. They’ve also beat the market across pretty much every two year period since the dot com bubble which indicates to me the market has been undervaluing them pretty consistently for quite a while.On Capex do you have any idea how much of those figures is due to replacing existing assets that are at the end of their useful life versus new capital investments. That would be very useful in gaging if those elevated capex numbers are permanent feature going forward.My general long term view is that TSM makes the most advanced chips that are essential to every tech company that wants to build software that uses lots of data. These will only become more prevalent in the future. TSM is by far the largest producer of these advanced chips which gives them substantial pricing power. Do you think any of that is misguided?",1,0.562,0.984,NEGATIVE

The reason TSM is so cheap compared to these other companies is because of the geopolitical risks associated with investing in a Taiwanese company. However, this risk is way overstated on many levels. 1. China invading Taiwan is nowhere near a certainty. 2. TSM is building manufacturing plants outside of Taiwan including in Arizona. 3. Most importantly if China were to invade Taiwan, the entire stock market would drop off a cliff. US involvement and concerns over nuclear war would hit all non military stocks. In that situation TSM probably falls like 70% but the rest of the market may drop by 30%. Buying a company trading at half its market value is entirely worth it if the biggest risk is that it would lose an extra 40% in value in the event of WW3 starting.

Intel was significantly ahead of both TSMC and Samsung.The bottom line is that Intel is a threat to TSMC.The fact that you cited Qualcomm as a threat to TSMC over Intel tells me how much you know about semiconductors.Meanwhile, Intel is solely focused on how to compete and win back its node advantage over TSMC. It even has the backing of the US government to do so.But here you are, saying that Qualcomm is a competitor to TSMC.This is what you wrote.No US company poses a threat to TSMC manufacturing, it's competitors are the likes of Samsung and Qualcomm.You said no US company poses a threat to TSMC. Then you write that Qualcomm is a competitor to TSMC. Qualcomm is a US company. Qualcomm is also fabless and they're 100% dependent on TSMC and Samsung.",6,0.559,0.978,NEGATIVE
