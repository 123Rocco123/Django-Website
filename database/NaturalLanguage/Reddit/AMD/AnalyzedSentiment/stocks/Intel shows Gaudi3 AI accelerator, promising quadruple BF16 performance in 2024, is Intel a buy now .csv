Am I delusional?","My Intel investment case is mostly on their own ""western"" fabs, which should work also in cases of trade wars and other political conflicts. The AI chips are nice, but I am sure Nvidia will stay superior as CUDA is way more popular in the mid term. Intels who enterprise segment seems pretty down.But I am happy - I am up like 70% on my January Intel investment and I think it will continue :D",0,0.539,0.939,POSITIVE

The it's priced too low part of the thesis is mostly gone here close to $50, so that leaves the comeback part of the thesis, which is something that could take years to play out.Seeing how Nvidia and AMD are executing so well, plus the existence of ARMH, and the trend of Google, Amazon, Microsoft to design and make their own chips, it tells me that Intel has an uphill battle ahead.Still, markets overshoot all the time and I'm well aware that a rally next week could send Intel higher before it goes lower. I just didn't want to miss out on a 15% one-week gain as nibbling more frequent but smaller gains is more my style.",2,0.543,1.0,NEGATIVE

There was actually an entire anti-trust case against them that you may have read in the news about several years ago.Plus, before the release of the Zen line of chips Intel was barely improving its product line generation after generation. After the release of Zen, it took a while for Intel to start being competitive again and AMD felt confident enough to just raise prices because of the volumes they were managing to sell.Meanwhile if you compare Nvidia and AMD on the GPU front you'll see that Nvidia released significantly better hardware at least every 1.5-2 years compared to their previous products regardless of how well or poorly AMD was doing in comparison. Another thing you'll notice is that on the software side Nvidia was usually first to market on important technologies, and AMD played copycat to keep up, and was forced to make their stuff open standard/open source, which meant fewer monetization avenues.",3,0.559,0.571,POSITIVE

Am I delusional?","Chip wars and tribalism aside, one has to assess which is the best one to put their next dollar of investment.Intel has had a big run from $32 to $47 and AMD has run from $80 to $140. During that time, Nvidia has had two monumental earnings and yet the share price hasn't moved up appreciably. Both of those earnings which had ho-hum reactions were impressive for the strong future they indicated. That once future narrative is quickly becoming present fact.My instinct today is that even though NVDA tripled in 2023, it may be poised for another leg up that didn't arrive on these last two quarters. And that the other two may have just experienced much of their rally potential.",0,0.55,0.996,NEGATIVE
