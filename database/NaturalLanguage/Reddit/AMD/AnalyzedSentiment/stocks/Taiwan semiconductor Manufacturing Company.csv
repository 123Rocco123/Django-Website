,"Does anyone have any opinions on if this is a good investment? Given the recent AI boom everyone is focused on big players such as NVIDIA and AMD, but they are both supplied heavily by TSM for their chips. I don’t see much competition for TSM given they are so far advanced ahead of any American or Chinese competitor, and given the only increase in demand for AI technology, I don’t see how they wouldn’t grow. Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion. Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan. Trump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large.

Any thoughts on TSM as an investment?","The stock is not that expensive. It trades for 25x earnings and has long term sales growth of 20-30% per year. It is well run, impossible to copy and has few competitors. Note that it trades for less than half the earnings multiple as nvidia, even though nvidia is essentially repackaging tsmc product.",0,0.596,0.997,POSITIVE

Any thoughts on TSM as an investment?",That’s because Nvidia has way higher revenues and margins. Annualized it’s like $80b for TSMC and 50% margins vs $120b for Nvidia and 75% margins. Both are great companies. TSMC will always trade at a discount no matter what due to geopolitics. I don’t see multiple expanding to same level as US semi companies.,1,0.528,0.986,POSITIVE
