(And slow losses can lure you into thinking it's not so bad, it's only $XXX I've lost).I generally will build up to 1000 shares of each stock I own, then I'll stop buying it. Unless it's doing extremely well, or has a very high dividend.Once I have 500 shares of a stock, I may start buying 1 or 2 other stocks and do the same.So, the answer to your question is ""It depends""Factors:How much of each stock do you have?Are there any stocks that are trending better because of the current sentiment of that company or sector? If Yes, consider adding those.I only sell stocks when a company faces bad news, repeatedly, fails to meet earnings, or some other major issue. I will, however, sell if the stock price stagnates for more than 6 months. The opportunity costs are too high for money not to have gains for 6 months.",0,0.572,1.0,NEGATIVE
