Cheers ðŸ¥‚","2 types of options (which are contracts representing 100 shares of the underlying stock): Calls & Puts. Buying a call option gives you the right but not the obligation to buy a stock at whatâ€™s called the strike price. Buying a put option gives you the right but not the obligation to sell a stock at the strike price. All options have an expiration date (anywhere between 1 day and 2+ years into future). If you buy a call, youâ€™re betting the stock price will increase (bullish) within the timeframe, if you buy a put youâ€™re betting the price will decrease (bearish).

Cheers ðŸ¥‚","The simple version is: buying a call is a bet the stock will go up, buying a put is a bet the stock will go down.It's more complicated than that since each option contract has an expiration date and ""strike"" at which the contract is exercised. Options can be both bought and sold. And seemingly infinite combinations of dates and strikes could be selected in multi-leg orders to benefit from much more than just movement in the stock price, such as changes in expected volatility, or even to benefit from little to no movement at all. OP gave a great paragraph-length overview, but truly understanding will take some reading and practice.After trading options for years, I don't think they're generally that cool, other than to give leverage to movement bets, such as OP buying calls to bet we'd bounce hard off that dip.

Cheers ðŸ¥‚","I should add that the cost of buying an option is called the premium (which is shown on a per share basis, so if the option shows a premium of $5.00, since the contract is for 100 shares the price of 1 contract would be $500.00). The premium is typically some fraction of the underlying stock price, which is why you get leverage. For the same amount of money, you can take a much larger position in a stock using options. You can sell the option anytime between when you first buy it and the expiration date. The optionâ€™s value decreases with time, so if you hold it all the way until expiration, to break even the stock price must be equal to the strike price plus the premium you paid for it (so if stock ABC was at $100 at expiration date of a call option with a strike price of $95 and you paid a $5 premium, you would break even. However, you can make lots of money well before expiration even if the stock doesnâ€™t cross the strike price if the stock increased in a short period of time (i.e. the value of the stock option increased due to the change in price more than it decreased due to time (or theta) decay.",2,0.561,1.0,NEGATIVE

Cheers ðŸ¥‚","You can make or lose a lot of money very quickly but with BUYING options you can only lose the money you invest (canâ€™t go negative like shorting a stock, unless youâ€™re using margin but thatâ€™s true for buying stocks on margin too). However, you can also do something called Writing options contracts (I.e. creating options out of thin air and then selling these options contracts you donâ€™t own), you write options to make money on the premium but the risk is you have to payout on options you write that are profitable for the buyer. Say you write (sell to someone) a call option, the premium is $20.00, the strike price is $50, and the price of the stock has increased from $30 to $120 within the timeframe (at or before expiration) and the buyer chooses to exercise the call option he bought from you: You now must sell him 100 shares of the stock at the strike price of $50, even though the current price is $120 (what a bargain for the buyer!), assuming you donâ€™t already own 100 shares of the stock, you must buy 100 shares of the stock at the current price of $120 in order to sell it to the call option holder for $50 a share. The end result for you the writer: you initially made $20 premium x 100 shares = $2000 from writing the option contract but you lost ($120 - $50) x 100 shares = $7000 when the buyer exerted the option, so you have a net loss = -$5000.",4,0.544,1.0,NEGATIVE
