If they do, congress and the people will pressure them to stop rate hikes. Powell only mentioned ""some pain"" in August and he already got a lot of pushback for it. Furthermore, recession is never a guarantee, always a probability. Even if the probability is high, the Fed will say stuff like ""narrow path to soft landing"". Also, recession is usually caused by an external shock in a fragile economy. We're in a fragile economy right now. What shock will cause us to go into a recession is unknown, but the more fragile the economy is, the less of a big shock we need to tip us over. Recession is also ""group think"". The more people who thinks there'll be a recession, the more they'll cut down on spending, the more likely we'll enter one. So the Fed never wants to contribute to the negative talk.With that said, the closest you'll ever see to the Fed ""predicting a recession"" is in their GDP forecast. If you see very close to 0 GDP growth, that means very likely a recession, or at least FEELS like a recession. If you see negative GDP growth, that means recession prediction by Fed.
