Holding NVDA and AMD.,Past performance is no guarantee for future results. Microsoft was an amazing company in 2000 and was a consistent performer for 10 years and the top tech stock. It took 16-17 years for Microsoft to recover back to 2000 levels after it crashed.I personally believe Nvidia has pulled forward a ton of GPU demand this year due to Biden’s ban on advanced chip sales to China. Chinese tech giants are placing massive billion dollar orders to stock up on chips in case their supply is cut off. There’s also a surge in sales due to generative AI hype. There are start ups raising capital to buy a billion dollars of GPUs for a GPU cluster. I think most of the Gen AI stuff will end up useless. Eventually the bubble will pop and demand will fall off. A few companies will make good use of it to boost their existing products. I think Nvidia sees a big bump and then their sales level off or fall off and then stop growing anywhere close to as much.

Holding NVDA and AMD.,"I don't think mortgage interest rates have anything to do with these stock prices short of a reduction in their consumer product sales.Where it'll affect them is in their ability to use debt to fund new capital projects for factories.As well in the USA market most mortgages are 30 year fixed which means it's much harder for interest rates to affect existing home owners.Generally speaking companies don't like using their capital to invest in capital projects and much more prefer to issue bonds to fund those projects.More likely it'll affect their desire to use debt to finance investments which is actually what higher rates cause.A rising tide raises all ships, and when government bond rates go up, so do corporate bonds, so project capital plans and their ROI become harder to achieve which slows down corporate investment activity.",0,0.546,1.0,NEGATIVE

That means less than 10% profit is a loss for those people. The question is how likely 10% or higher return is. This is based on my personal situation. Holding NVDA and AMD.,"Not consistently, this is an average specifically for US markets.The US went through an economic boom during the 1900s and the largest US companies were large net beneficiaries of economic trends like globalism and the adoption of the internet over the last several decades. That 8% market average basically assumes the next 100 years of US economic performance will be at least as good as the last.I wrote a comment recently how I think AAPL is likely to return around a 3-4% annually from here. I think the same is largely true of most companies which dominate the S&P500.I could be wrong of course, but there's a lot of reasons to think the next 10-20 years will not provide returns like the last few decades – deglobalisation, high debt levels, demographics, an end of US economic dominance, high relative valuations in the US, politically unsustainable levels of inequality, a possible reversion of the recent outperformance of capital vs labour.That said, nominally anything could happen... Many investors have been talking about how the risk premium of owning stocks is the lowest it's ever been, but I suspect this is because the inflationary risk of owning bonds is possibly the highest it's ever been. High quality stocks like AAPL imo are probably some of the better inflation-hedges out there. This probably explains some of the excessive valuation, but this doesn't mean the real returns of such large US stocks or the US market will be anything close to what they've been historically.",1,0.538,0.998,NEGATIVE

Holding NVDA and AMD.,"Pessimists always sound smart; being a bull requires someone to think “yeah you know, the market has been doing well for the past 100 years and I think it will continue to do well throughout my lifetime.” Ultimately, however, it’s the optimists with skin in the game, whereas pessimists can stand on the sidelines indefinitely.",2,0.525,0.985,POSITIVE

Holding NVDA and AMD.,"This is obviously a silly statement. If everyone assumes the market is guaranteed to give them a 8% annualised return then the risks are probably not being priced correctly. In general the more certain investors become about the return of an investment, the more likely there is to be mispricing.That said, you may be on to something if you believe the US stock market has become politicised. It's quite possible politicians will pump the market to keep, but this comes at the cost of inflationary risks.This is why I mentioned nominal returns because nominal returns can be manipulated by fiscal and monetary policy. Real returns imo are likely to be lower this century than last, this is simply because real yields are likely to be lower this century given demographic and growth trends. And over longer periods of time stocks should track risk-free yields with a slight risk premium.Nothing I've said here means you shouldn't be bullish on stocks long-term. Not that I should have to clarify this.",5,0.547,1.0,NEGATIVE
