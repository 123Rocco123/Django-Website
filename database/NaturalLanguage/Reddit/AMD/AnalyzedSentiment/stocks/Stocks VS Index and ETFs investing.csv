,"I don't have the benefit of time and compounding on my side. What is the benefit of owning individual stocks unless you are trying to beat the market, which even the professionals don't always do according to the stats? I've been investing over 20 years, I'd be happy to track the SPY, or a little better, by selling calls and puts on SPY and QQQ, and my other holdings, when the timing is right. Current holdings. SPY, QQQ, XLE, XLV SCHD DGRO, and few REITs, like O WPC STAG for a little higher yeild. For some higher beta exposure I'm holding a few like, NVDA, TSLA, GOOG, ETSY, CRM, AMD, BX MS ect, as a smaller part of my portfolio. If I can get average returns of 7-8% over the years, mainly staying in indexes and ETFs, and another 7-8% selling covered calls and cash secured puts on my holdings, who wouldn't be happy with 16% a year? Poke holes in my strategy.",I like the education I get about the world around me through research. I might beat the market and I might not but I’m definitely smarter than when I first started.,0,0.539,0.999,POSITIVE

Ex: I have 100k and I put 30% in the Dow. Well I really Coca Cola so I may put 2-4% of my account in Coke as well. Overall I’m still safe with an index, but I can increase my exposure to the underlying companies I really like.",0,0.534,0.88,NEGATIVE

Poke holes in my strategy.",I prefer individual stocks - I just seem to have better overall return that way but there’s been some luck that came with that too. I tend to invest in companies that look like they’ll have big exposure in 5-10 years. I don’t want an etf with 3% of its holdings in that company.,0,0.557,1.0,NEGATIVE
