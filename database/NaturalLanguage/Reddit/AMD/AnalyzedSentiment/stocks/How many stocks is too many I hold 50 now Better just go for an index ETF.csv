,"So over years, I've been gathering over 50 stocks. Of course, some have performed great, largely because my timing, mid-2022, was an excellent entry point. But of course, I can't help brag about my selection choice. For example, Qualcomm, AMD, JPM, MSFT, GOOG, Citi. I (think), I hit most of the semiconductor names, except NVDA. For some reason, it never felt like a good investment. I have my skepticism about LLMs and Gen-AI hype. Besides, generating cat pics or idle plays with Chat-GPT, I haven't yet seen a business effectively using Gen-AI as a compelling competitive edge. So, please educate me here as well. AMD is different because of data center servers product line - which is more solid story. Besides missing such obvious biggies, not all of what I touched has performed. I felt, European carmakers (BMW, VW, MBG) were deep value at PE 3-5 and 8-9% yields, but obviously I was wrong. They were cheap for a reason. Main question - I was wondering if I can do a simulation of hypothetical scenario where I had simply invested in index, saving me enormous time in research. If so, please suggest tools/sites? Note that the amounts and time of entry/exit are not constant, so I can't use the simple lumpsum or periodic investing calculators that assume regular constant amounts and intervals. With 50 stocks in my portfolio, I wonder if it is just mirroring the index, or generating any real alpha. Obviously, when I buy something, I am highly convinced of my reasonings.

How do you cope with these emotional aspects of investing?","That's easy enough to figure out, just time consuming to do the math.Step 1) Select an S&P 500 index fund that you'd have invested in instead (like VOO).Step 2) Look up a chart listing the opening and closing price of said fund every day the market was open over whatever time period you were investing (I use Yahoo Finance for this, but I'm sure there's plenty of other options that have the same data).Step 3) If you don't already have it, track all of your individual buys and sells of your stock in a spreadsheet.Step 4) Add some columns in the spreadsheet for assuming you bought into your S&P 500 index instead with the same dollar amount. Be consistent, like using the closing price of your index on that date (unless you just so happened to also buy into that index on the same day, in which case you can use that price instead).Step 5) Now that you have the number of ""share"" you'd own of that index see how the number tracks compared to your real world outcome.I find this to be a very helpful exercise for me. I tend to consistently under perform the index in the year I buy into stocks, but then a lot of those buys tend to outperform the index in later years as I continue to hold.",2,0.549,0.524,NEGATIVE

You are clearly way more knowledgeable on your investments and the market as a whole. But I'd say, assuming your 50 stocks are somewhat diversified, you have created your own personal index fund of sorts. It would just get tricky if you are actively monitoring each very closely and are able to get emotionally swayed on short term ups/downs. Long-term it would depend on what exactly your risk profile is.In an ideal scenario everything booms and you see colossal gains, but on average your likely to see less than ideal results. Given the time and effort it sounds like you have put into it, it might be slightly more ideal (to you) than any other index, but your time/effort doesn't matter to the market. If its something you like doing and there is weight within each of the 50 stocks then I don't see an issue. If you have 10-15 stocks making up a large percentage of your portfolio, I might consider reducing the smaller impact ones, or at least reducing your effort with those. Might makes sense to employ some type of threshold to make each investment more worth your time.

For some reason, it never felt like a good investment. I have my skepticism about LLMs and Gen-AI hype. Besides, generating cat pics or idle plays with Chat-GPT, I haven't yet seen a business effectively using Gen-AI as a compelling competitive edge. So, please educate me here as well. AMD is different because of data center servers product line - which is more solid story. Besides missing such obvious biggies, not all of what I touched has performed. I felt, European carmakers (BMW, VW, MBG) were deep value at PE 3-5 and 8-9% yields, but obviously I was wrong. They were cheap for a reason. Main question - I was wondering if I can do a simulation of hypothetical scenario where I had simply invested in index, saving me enormous time in research. If so, please suggest tools/sites? Note that the amounts and time of entry/exit are not constant, so I can't use the simple lumpsum or periodic investing calculators that assume regular constant amounts and intervals. With 50 stocks in my portfolio, I wonder if it is just mirroring the index, or generating any real alpha. Obviously, when I buy something, I am highly convinced of my reasonings. So, it's hard to part with what I feel are ""my gems"".
