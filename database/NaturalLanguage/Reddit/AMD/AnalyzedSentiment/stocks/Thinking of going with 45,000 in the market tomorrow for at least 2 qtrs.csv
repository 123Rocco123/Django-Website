Buy 1 piece now, and wait and see for maybe 2 week before the next piece and so on.I'm assuming you can afford the risk implied - but don't let pricing force you from buying a good company at a meh price to a meh company at a low price, IMO. People called tesla overvalued in 2017, but if you had vision and you understood their technological progress you made a killing. The people who sat around complaining about P/E just moved on to another thing to complain about - they will sound smart and they won't lose money, but they also aren't making any and risk missing generational wealth.Develop your own strategy and perspective and have conviction.Don't bet the farm.",0,0.545,0.949,NEGATIVE
