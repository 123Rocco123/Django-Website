,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/intel-intc-earnings-report-q4-2023.html Intel shares dropped in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker issued an outlook for the first quarter of 2024 that lagged analyst forecasts even as results for the latest quarter beat Wall Street estimates. Here’s how Intel did versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations for the quarter ended in December: Earnings per share: 54 cents adjusted, vs. 45 cents expected Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.15 billion expected For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Intel expects earnings per share of 13 cents on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue. Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 billion, or 16 cents per share, last year. With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue. Intel shares are up over 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia and AMD on Wall Street. Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia’s recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel. Now, AI servers can have as many as eight Nvidia or AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) attached to one or two Intel CPUs. Intel also continues to focus on a five-year plan implemented by CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took over the chipmaker in 2021. Intel wants to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in its ability to offer manufacturing services to other companies, while also improving its own branded chips. Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye into an independent company in 2022. Intel’s largest division is its Client Computing group, which includes laptop and PC processor chips. The overall PC industry has been in a slump for two years, but recently started showing signs of growth again. Intel reported $8.8 billion in fourth-quarter sales, up 33%. Intel’s second largest division, Data Center and AI, saw sales decline 10% to $4 billion. That unit includes server CPUs and GPUs. Intel foundry services, its business making chips for other companies, remains nascent, with $291 million in revenue, a 63% annual increase.","To some degree they are setting the bar low in Q1 for a beat. They have done this in the past. Q1 and Q2 are seasonally their weakest quarters. It’s definitely a disappointing guide in Q1 but they are still the biggest value in the semiconductor space. They still have a killer gross margin of 40%+. A 10% to 15% sell off is a buying opportunity. Late edit. Q1 2023 eps was a loss of -.04. So the analyst average of .33 per share sure looks like a mistake by one or more analysts in adjusting for the seasonality of the business. This is an average of 36 analysts, only takes a couple of analysts to skew an average if they don’t model appropriately.",0,0.522,0.998,NEGATIVE

It has to do with a companies free cash flow and earnings per share. Let’s say you had free cash flow of 9.6 billion but stock compensation of 2 billion. That means your free cash flow is really 7.6 billion. That drags down your free cash flow per share and is a form of dilution. Because those new shares have to be created when the option to exercise is used.

Here’s how Intel did versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations for the quarter ended in December: Earnings per share: 54 cents adjusted, vs. 45 cents expected Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.15 billion expected For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Intel expects earnings per share of 13 cents on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue. Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 billion, or 16 cents per share, last year. With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue. Intel shares are up over 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia and AMD on Wall Street. Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia’s recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel.

Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye into an independent company in 2022.

Every server has one or more often two CPUs. They also often utilize specialized accelerator cards used for everything from encrypting network traffic to more efficiently handling video streaming.

Here’s how Intel did versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations for the quarter ended in December: Earnings per share: 54 cents adjusted, vs. 45 cents expected Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.15 billion expected For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Intel expects earnings per share of 13 cents on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue. Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 billion, or 16 cents per share, last year. With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue. Intel shares are up over 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia and AMD on Wall Street. Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia’s recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel. Now, AI servers can have as many as eight Nvidia or AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) attached to one or two Intel CPUs. Intel also continues to focus on a five-year plan implemented by CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took over the chipmaker in 2021. Intel wants to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in its ability to offer manufacturing services to other companies, while also improving its own branded chips. Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye into an independent company in 2022. Intel’s largest division is its Client Computing group, which includes laptop and PC processor chips.

,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/intel-intc-earnings-report-q4-2023.html Intel shares dropped in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker issued an outlook for the first quarter of 2024 that lagged analyst forecasts even as results for the latest quarter beat Wall Street estimates. Here’s how Intel did versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations for the quarter ended in December: Earnings per share: 54 cents adjusted, vs. 45 cents expected Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.15 billion expected For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Intel expects earnings per share of 13 cents on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue. Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 billion, or 16 cents per share, last year. With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue. Intel shares are up over 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia and AMD on Wall Street. Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia’s recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel. Now, AI servers can have as many as eight Nvidia or AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) attached to one or two Intel CPUs. Intel also continues to focus on a five-year plan implemented by CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took over the chipmaker in 2021. Intel wants to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in its ability to offer manufacturing services to other companies, while also improving its own branded chips. Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye into an independent company in 2022. Intel’s largest division is its Client Computing group, which includes laptop and PC processor chips. The overall PC industry has been in a slump for two years, but recently started showing signs of growth again. Intel reported $8.8 billion in fourth-quarter sales, up 33%. Intel’s second largest division, Data Center and AI, saw sales decline 10% to $4 billion. That unit includes server CPUs and GPUs. Intel foundry services, its business making chips for other companies, remains nascent, with $291 million in revenue, a 63% annual increase.","People have been talking about the Intel turnaround since 2020-2021. Its been 3 years and its always the same phrases lolYeah, Intel wont bankrupt but this doesn't mean that you as a shareholder with have any gains from buying this stock.Do you buy Microsoft because ""the US will not allow Microsoft to fail""? No, you buy Microsoft because it's a great company with growing revenue, positive cash flow and increasing profits.

AMDs position before ryzen chips was far worse than Intel. I mean the company would've basically defaulted if ryzen didn't workI remember buying the FX 8350 because I was too broke to buy Intel i5 at the time. That shit was like a heater and everyone made fun of it. The meme was literally ""don't get a heater, just get an AMD cpu and you'll be fine for Alaskan winters.""When I bought AMD it was literally because of the CEO who's researxh was in semiconductors and she was hell bent on r&d on cooling which was a huge problem for AMD chips. Even first gen ryzen were running hotter than they should've. Just look at LTT reviews of ryzen 1st gen or any other reviewer. Heat remained an issue until 2nd to 3rd genEven when ryzen 1st gen came out, ppl said it wouldn't work. Ibe been holding AMD right from the beginning due to the company's plan. Intel has a very similar plan and if implemented properly itll be just like AMD is currently.Btw AMD barely turned a profit from its ryzen chips. It was in the next few gens of the chip where things started picking up steam. If you're going to invest in chip companies, the time horizon is close to a decade for a proper return. AMD rn for me is 10x of initial investment (bought at $17) and that's because I jnvested during their research period for ryzen.After my research, Intel is in the same period of r&d. Once it's completed and they go to manufacturing, that's when the stock price rises and everyone jumps on. If you're looking at a <5 year time horizon for semiconductors you're going to fail. It takes years just to build a refinery and even longer to complete r&d on a new gen of chips and being it to market.It's the same thing with companies like TSMC. I bought that in 2019 and everyone back then was saying thr same bs they did with Intel.Also comparing MSFT to Intel is insane. Complete different markets, time horizons, profitabilith targets, product type etc.",3,0.561,1.0,NEGATIVE

Here’s how Intel did versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations for the quarter ended in December: Earnings per share: 54 cents adjusted, vs. 45 cents expected Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.15 billion expected For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Intel expects earnings per share of 13 cents on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue. Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 billion, or 16 cents per share, last year. With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue. Intel shares are up over 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia and AMD on Wall Street. Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia’s recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel. Now, AI servers can have as many as eight Nvidia or AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) attached to one or two Intel CPUs. Intel also continues to focus on a five-year plan implemented by CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took over the chipmaker in 2021. Intel wants to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in its ability to offer manufacturing services to other companies, while also improving its own branded chips. Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye into an independent company in 2022. Intel’s largest division is its Client Computing group, which includes laptop and PC processor chips. The overall PC industry has been in a slump for two years, but recently started showing signs of growth again. Intel reported $8.8 billion in fourth-quarter sales, up 33%.

Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 billion, or 16 cents per share, last year. With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue. Intel shares are up over 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia and AMD on Wall Street. Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia’s recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel. Now, AI servers can have as many as eight Nvidia or AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) attached to one or two Intel CPUs. Intel also continues to focus on a five-year plan implemented by CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took over the chipmaker in 2021. Intel wants to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in its ability to offer manufacturing services to other companies, while also improving its own branded chips. Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye into an independent company in 2022. Intel’s largest division is its Client Computing group, which includes laptop and PC processor chips. The overall PC industry has been in a slump for two years, but recently started showing signs of growth again. Intel reported $8.8 billion in fourth-quarter sales, up 33%. Intel’s second largest division, Data Center and AI, saw sales decline 10% to $4 billion. That unit includes server CPUs and GPUs. Intel foundry services, its business making chips for other companies, remains nascent, with $291 million in revenue, a 63% annual increase.",Intel is still up ~70%.
