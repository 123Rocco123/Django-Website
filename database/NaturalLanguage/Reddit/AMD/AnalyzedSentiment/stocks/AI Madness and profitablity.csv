,"This isn't a post about AI bubble or why the chip and cloud hardware supplier is on a nutty uptrend. Their revenue in cases like NVDA has grew 120%+ YoY with insane profit margin, and since market is short sighted, it makes sense why the insane run. Lot of people kicking themselves for not see this coming, or someone like me who saw it coming but exited earlier because couldn’t value the “shovel” correctly in this gold rush. Now lets take a step back and look at this trend from a different angle. Main buyers are the big 5 Google, OpenAI, META, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT (GOMAM). In order for your you all to understand my next points we all first have to agree on few basic things 1). Companies have FINITE capex amount 2). Every company at the end of the day WANTS to make money 3). Every company wants to find a way to REDUCE their capex and still grow For point #2, the way these company will eventually make money is by selling the products to consumer and business. So in next 5-10 years we will see leap in software and services innovations. We will see so many new small and midsize companies using these applications to build more complex solutions on cloud. Now take your guess who will benefit the most from this? if your answer is GOMAM, thats correct. If your answer is NVDA then you are an idiot. I would say point #1 and point #3 go hand in hand, we are seeing lot of capex diverted within the company itself. So to no surprise, GOMAM are already building and some have built their own silicon. Its just matter of time when they start to reduce their exposure to external company. This isn’t to say that NVDA will ever become irrelevant. The point is they will always have to outgrow and justify for GOMAM to spend their capex on them. This is the bet you are making for going LONG nvidia at these valuation. Because again, market is short sighted, they are seeing 6-12 month guidance and pumping. Now i am seeing crazy amount of doom and gloom for companies like AAPL and GOOG lately on reddit and also on media. I just have one question, that goes to #2. How do you guys think every software and services that will leverage these new silicon will reach the end users? Think for a second form a consumer standpoint. They don’t know wtf is NVDA, AMD. All they know is smartphones, tablets, wearable, laptops. I am not saying where you should invest your money. I am just saying don’t go with the trend like a madman. if you miss the shovel rush, you can still make plenty of money on factories that will make gold products for end users. in summary, I see there is more value in going long on GOMAAM (Added AAPL) than NVDA,AMD",AI trading. Money for everyone. No human will need to work ever. World peace.,0,0.549,0.655,POSITIVE

With that being said, its quite alarming how will this yield the revenues projected or expected, maybe it will be equipped to music and film producers as well, but we need to see consistency and new tech released soon, current LLMs are very error prone and it won't help so much on the long run.Maybe AI can advance a little bit and we start seeing advancements in forecasting/decision making? That would need any new forecasting model unlike LLMs, to stop making errors and pile nonsensical analysis/results of data. Maybe more in data analysis, but that have been around for years now.Thing is we've had AI for years now, we're all acting as if it's a new thing in 2024, it moved from the realm of science and engineering to sales and marketing, which is not that great, but I hope we can learn from the dot com bubble.

How do you guys think every software and services that will leverage these new silicon will reach the end users? Think for a second form a consumer standpoint. They don’t know wtf is NVDA, AMD. All they know is smartphones, tablets, wearable, laptops. I am not saying where you should invest your money. I am just saying don’t go with the trend like a madman. if you miss the shovel rush, you can still make plenty of money on factories that will make gold products for end users. in summary, I see there is more value in going long on GOMAAM (Added AAPL) than NVDA,AMD",I quite like this take; leveraging AI is like pumping steroids into existing business and workflows.

,"This isn't a post about AI bubble or why the chip and cloud hardware supplier is on a nutty uptrend. Their revenue in cases like NVDA has grew 120%+ YoY with insane profit margin, and since market is short sighted, it makes sense why the insane run. Lot of people kicking themselves for not see this coming, or someone like me who saw it coming but exited earlier because couldn’t value the “shovel” correctly in this gold rush. Now lets take a step back and look at this trend from a different angle. Main buyers are the big 5 Google, OpenAI, META, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT (GOMAM). In order for your you all to understand my next points we all first have to agree on few basic things 1). Companies have FINITE capex amount 2). Every company at the end of the day WANTS to make money 3). Every company wants to find a way to REDUCE their capex and still grow For point #2, the way these company will eventually make money is by selling the products to consumer and business. So in next 5-10 years we will see leap in software and services innovations. We will see so many new small and midsize companies using these applications to build more complex solutions on cloud. Now take your guess who will benefit the most from this? if your answer is GOMAM, thats correct. If your answer is NVDA then you are an idiot. I would say point #1 and point #3 go hand in hand, we are seeing lot of capex diverted within the company itself. So to no surprise, GOMAM are already building and some have built their own silicon. Its just matter of time when they start to reduce their exposure to external company. This isn’t to say that NVDA will ever become irrelevant. The point is they will always have to outgrow and justify for GOMAM to spend their capex on them. This is the bet you are making for going LONG nvidia at these valuation.

I'm not buying that for my entire org.So far, no AI product has been able to actually leverage internal knowledge bases for anything useful, most products are worse than the dumbest interns I've ever had.ChatGTP and Copilot are the only LLM based products that delivered value to my company so far.

Every major entity in finance is has been using ML/Neuro Networks/AI and the tech is pretty equally distributed. Case in point you have tech heavy hedge funds like Two Sigma and they aren't delivering outsized returns compared to the rest of the industry. AI right now isn't a standalone driver for revenue - it's a layer for existing processes and products.I think there are similarities with the dotcom/Internet craze but that ramp up just led to the outcome that everyone had Internet access so no one had a massive advantage. It's not technological innovation that's the bottleneck - it's adoption by industries and consumers. At this point AI is a feature not a product and chat may be the killer app of AI but it reminds me a lot of the history of commercial email. At some point someone will slap ads on top of AI chat but chat in itself isn't a standalone product.The most successful implementation of AI I've seen is Githubs copilot which has a million plus paying users but Microsoft is also losing $20 an user right now. It's going to be really hard scaling AI right now because of the costs associated with buildout and operating costs. Long term these costs will go down but at that point there's no moat around any of these companies.,1,0.538,0.998,POSITIVE
,"This isn't a post about AI bubble or why the chip and cloud hardware supplier is on a nutty uptrend. Their revenue in cases like NVDA has grew 120%+ YoY with insane profit margin, and since market is short sighted, it makes sense why the insane run. Lot of people kicking themselves for not see this coming, or someone like me who saw it coming but exited earlier because couldn’t value the “shovel” correctly in this gold rush. Now lets take a step back and look at this trend from a different angle. Main buyers are the big 5 Google, OpenAI, META, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT (GOMAM). In order for your you all to understand my next points we all first have to agree on few basic things 1). Companies have FINITE capex amount 2). Every company at the end of the day WANTS to make money 3). Every company wants to find a way to REDUCE their capex and still grow For point #2, the way these company will eventually make money is by selling the products to consumer and business. So in next 5-10 years we will see leap in software and services innovations. We will see so many new small and midsize companies using these applications to build more complex solutions on cloud. Now take your guess who will benefit the most from this? if your answer is GOMAM, thats correct. If your answer is NVDA then you are an idiot. I would say point #1 and point #3 go hand in hand, we are seeing lot of capex diverted within the company itself. So to no surprise, GOMAM are already building and some have built their own silicon. Its just matter of time when they start to reduce their exposure to external company. This isn’t to say that NVDA will ever become irrelevant. The point is they will always have to outgrow and justify for GOMAM to spend their capex on them. This is the bet you are making for going LONG nvidia at these valuation. Because again, market is short sighted, they are seeing 6-12 month guidance and pumping. Now i am seeing crazy amount of doom and gloom for companies like AAPL and GOOG lately on reddit and also on media. I just have one question, that goes to #2. How do you guys think every software and services that will leverage these new silicon will reach the end users? Think for a second form a consumer standpoint. They don’t know wtf is NVDA, AMD. All they know is smartphones, tablets, wearable, laptops. I am not saying where you should invest your money. I am just saying don’t go with the trend like a madman. if you miss the shovel rush, you can still make plenty of money on factories that will make gold products for end users. in summary, I see there is more value in going long on GOMAAM (Added AAPL) than NVDA,AMD","Hedge Funds aren't a zero-sum game.

My point with AI usage within the industry is that when everyone has the same competitive advantage it's no longer a competitive advantage.

Now lets take a step back and look at this trend from a different angle. Main buyers are the big 5 Google, OpenAI, META, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT (GOMAM). In order for your you all to understand my next points we all first have to agree on few basic things 1). Companies have FINITE capex amount 2). Every company at the end of the day WANTS to make money 3). Every company wants to find a way to REDUCE their capex and still grow For point #2, the way these company will eventually make money is by selling the products to consumer and business. So in next 5-10 years we will see leap in software and services innovations. We will see so many new small and midsize companies using these applications to build more complex solutions on cloud. Now take your guess who will benefit the most from this? if your answer is GOMAM, thats correct. If your answer is NVDA then you are an idiot. I would say point #1 and point #3 go hand in hand, we are seeing lot of capex diverted within the company itself. So to no surprise, GOMAM are already building and some have built their own silicon. Its just matter of time when they start to reduce their exposure to external company. This isn’t to say that NVDA will ever become irrelevant. The point is they will always have to outgrow and justify for GOMAM to spend their capex on them. This is the bet you are making for going LONG nvidia at these valuation. Because again, market is short sighted, they are seeing 6-12 month guidance and pumping. Now i am seeing crazy amount of doom and gloom for companies like AAPL and GOOG lately on reddit and also on media. I just have one question, that goes to #2.

And now they have some of the best in house chip development in the world. Enough to say that in certain niches, Apple has a core competency that's amongst the best.Google/Microsoft/Amazon have thrown a pittance of money and effort their way towards hardware. Only Apple has done anything - and continues to be the only non semiconductor company putting money and resources into it.A chip here and there from Google and Amazon is a pittance. Hint: Not even Apple is spending big bucks on GPU development right now.

I am just saying don’t go with the trend like a madman. if you miss the shovel rush, you can still make plenty of money on factories that will make gold products for end users. in summary, I see there is more value in going long on GOMAAM (Added AAPL) than NVDA,AMD",Lol benzinga article about you,0,0.502,0.981,POSITIVE
,"This isn't a post about AI bubble or why the chip and cloud hardware supplier is on a nutty uptrend. Their revenue in cases like NVDA has grew 120%+ YoY with insane profit margin, and since market is short sighted, it makes sense why the insane run. Lot of people kicking themselves for not see this coming, or someone like me who saw it coming but exited earlier because couldn’t value the “shovel” correctly in this gold rush. Now lets take a step back and look at this trend from a different angle. Main buyers are the big 5 Google, OpenAI, META, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT (GOMAM). In order for your you all to understand my next points we all first have to agree on few basic things 1). Companies have FINITE capex amount 2). Every company at the end of the day WANTS to make money 3). Every company wants to find a way to REDUCE their capex and still grow For point #2, the way these company will eventually make money is by selling the products to consumer and business. So in next 5-10 years we will see leap in software and services innovations. We will see so many new small and midsize companies using these applications to build more complex solutions on cloud. Now take your guess who will benefit the most from this? if your answer is GOMAM, thats correct. If your answer is NVDA then you are an idiot. I would say point #1 and point #3 go hand in hand, we are seeing lot of capex diverted within the company itself. So to no surprise, GOMAM are already building and some have built their own silicon. Its just matter of time when they start to reduce their exposure to external company. This isn’t to say that NVDA will ever become irrelevant. The point is they will always have to outgrow and justify for GOMAM to spend their capex on them. This is the bet you are making for going LONG nvidia at these valuation. Because again, market is short sighted, they are seeing 6-12 month guidance and pumping. Now i am seeing crazy amount of doom and gloom for companies like AAPL and GOOG lately on reddit and also on media. I just have one question, that goes to #2.

They're so far behind. Nothing public, no partnerships, no co-pilot like integration in to any of their software. They're a hardware company and won't even have AI chips built in to their next gen desktops unlike the PC industry, which IS starting to build AI acceleration chips in to their next gen desktops.",0,0.558,0.864,NEGATIVE
