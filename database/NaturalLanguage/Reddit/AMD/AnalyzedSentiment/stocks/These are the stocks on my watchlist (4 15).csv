,"Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities. This is a daily watchlist for trading. I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on ____?” will be ignored. News: US Retail Sales Top Forecasts as Consumers Keep Fueling Growth TSLA- Lays off more than 10% of workforce GS- Beats earnings, $11.58 vs 8.56 expected, beats revenyue as well. Profit jumps due to trading and investment banking revenue. NMRA- Announces Clinical hold of Phase 1 Study for schizophrenia drug. CPNG- Raised paid membership fees (this is their equivalent of Amazon Prime) on Friday. Still spiked up on this news, INFA- CRM in talks to acquire, no price that I can find yet. AMD- Rumor that Google Cloud doesn’t plan to offer AMD AI chips. Longer-term watches: NVDA/SMCI, SNOW, BA, ULTA",Looks like nmra had to put the drug on hold due to side effects on rabbits? Anyways down 18% today,0,0.513,1.0,NEGATIVE
