A lot of people compare them to NVDA which isn't really fair. NVDA is the hype capital of the AI surge, INTC is the antiquated chip fabricator.Their significant investment into domestic fabs and fabs in allied nations is a huge move to become a major player in the never-ending global supply for chips. With Chinese tensions always high and Taiwan always under threat of China it eases a lot of nerves to know we can shift production to domestic areas where there are no threats or disruptions.Pair that with tax incentives and grants to get started, as well as countless billions in government/military contracting and Intel will be doing fine. Do I expect a 100x? No. But Intel to become very profitable and establishing a large market share of all chip fabrication is not an unreasonable endpoint.
