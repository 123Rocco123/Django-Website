,"I have a clear vision of the Metaverse world and its immense potential for the future. My focus is on identifying stocks that have the capacity to shape and embody this vision. Initially, I invested in AMD back in 2016, primarily because it was more affordable compared to Intel, and I happened to get lucky. In 2018, I added NVIDIA to my portfolio as I had a deep interest in gaming and GPU/computer building. In 2020, I purchased an Oculus device, which allowed me to glimpse into an untapped future. Interestingly, Facebook, now META, has emerged as a dominant player in this space. It's possible that they will enjoy several years of success, much like Intel did in 2016. Recently, I discovered Roblox, a company that shares my vision and embodies how I envision the true metaverse operating. They have a long road ahead, but with the right talent within the company, they have the potential to achieve their goals. Patience will be crucial since the key lies in retaining their user base into adulthood rather than solely targeting adults at present. This journey will undoubtedly take years. Furthermore, their success is reliant on partnerships with NVIDIA and other hardware manufacturers who can provide the necessary technology. I believe Roblox could be the interface we rely on as AI progresses and 3D/VR technology becomes more advanced. Considering all this, I seek advice on whether to invest in this company now or wait for future developments, especially if I anticipate Roblox to resemble the fictional 'Innovative Online Industries' from the book Ready Player One. While there seems to be a collective vision for the future, the uncertainty lies in identifying the company that can bring it to life. What are your thoughts on this matter?","Meta will have nothing to do with the metaverse. Roblox will remain a kids game. Neither will have any future in ""the metaverse"" because they aren't doing the technology that will actually drive people to the metaverse and out of the games there currently are.Roblox may be its own version of what could be considered a metaverse just like Fortnite and Minecraft but they lack the ability to go outside of their own game, the ability to take items out of certain games and into others is what will drive popularity along with being able to sell those items to other players. Decentralization is the way, none of the current infrastructure for any of these games incorporate this ability.There are few public companies that are pushing for this reality and building it. Anything less will just be what we already have and will not be disruptive or innovative.",0,0.512,1.0,NEGATIVE

The main issue I see is fully functional hardware that would allow people to acres it in a way that could live up to its potential. Someone would need to come up with something portable, light weight, with excellent battery life.",2,0.51,0.897,NEGATIVE
