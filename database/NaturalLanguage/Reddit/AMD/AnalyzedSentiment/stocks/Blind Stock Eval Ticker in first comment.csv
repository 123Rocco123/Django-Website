,"If you saw a stock with a P/E ratio of 1,485 and an EPS of .10 How likely would you be to buy that stock, and without looking at the first comment, does anyone have any guesses on what it is? Other discussion points- would you bail on a stock with these numbers? I feel like the valuation is so far off, hype is so high, but hard to exit a stock that’s doing well.

So what does it even mean to say that the current P/E is 1000 or more? Without exceptional items it’s less than 100.Note, I’m not commenting on whether I think AMD is fair value.

Ticker:",Since this is a cyclical stock the best time to buy would be when it has a high P/E because it represents an earnings low. In theory the ratio will lower as the denominator (earnings) increase next cycle.This is why looking at P/E in a vacuum is not really enlightening.,0,0.569,1.0,NEGATIVE

Ticker:",It’s expensive but forward PE is 39 and change and the PEG ratio is just over 2 so it’s not as outrageous as it appears at first glance but again I can’t understand the cyclical nature of chip stocks and that is why I bailed on Nvidia before its big run. I personally would stay away but that’s not to say that other investors don’t know something I don’t because they probably do.That said it can’t afford ANY hiccups or it will get decimated in my opinion. Also were there any one off expenses that are artificially bloating the PE that will be gone next earnings? There is alot more to look at than what you posted here,0,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE

Perhaps the only way for me to know this back then is to read their earnings announcement and read their financial statements.
