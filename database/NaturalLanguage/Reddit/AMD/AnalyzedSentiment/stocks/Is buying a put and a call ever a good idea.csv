If you’re right and a big move happens, then you win big in one direction. However, if only a small move happens, then both your call and put are out the money and your shit out of luck.Buying a straddle tends to be higher entry cost, but also higher chance of success. You buy both - $70call & $70 put.One conservative strategy is a long straddle. You buy a short term put, and a long term call.For example, you think this $70 stock will go up, so you buy a $68put for Feb 1st as a hedge, but you buy a $72 call for March 1st. This way, You get a little more time to have your call eventuate, but also buy a hedge in case there’s negative movement right off the bat.",4,0.549,1.0,NEGATIVE

So I am trying to learn if there is any purpose of buying a put and a call at the same time,"Yes, the strategy can be a great hedge, if you have a sizeable stock position and speculate that the market is going to go down or up.In example: Buying a put serves as a function to ""short"" the market. The best time to buy puts is when the bullish thesis is running very high and, more importantly, volatility is down. (Usually this means that prices for buying put options will be low, compared to a market that has mid-to-higher volatility in anticipation of bigger stock movements). The beauty of buying puts is that your risk is defined.Buying a call works the same way, only it is a bullish play on the market or individual stock.Selling covered puts is a good way, especially in a stable market, to earn some extra premium dollars on stocks that you feel are range bound, therefore, you can pick a strike price that will allow you to stay within a specific stock price range, and, when the expiration date comes, you will be out of the money, thereby, you will collect your premium and can rinse and repeat as you wish. If you're selling covered puts then you also have the option, in high quality ETF's or stocks, should the stock dip, to buy it at a lower price AND collect the premium too.Selling a covered call (only covered, never naked): I would just buy JEPI as this is a stock that utilizes this very same strategy, only it is done by professionals and, you get a nice dividend.In summary, if you're just getting started, depending on how much money you have to invest, I would stick with buying puts and buying calls. Once you get your feet wet, then I would, firstly, do the homework to understand how selling puts and selling calls works. (again, make sure you're cash covered) but they can be a lucrative ""icing on the cake"" scenario when done correctly to already held stock positions.",0,0.542,0.939,NEGATIVE

I would, however, very strongly advise you to truly learn about what you're dealing with. With options you can really get your fingers burnt.Be prepared that something very little (e.g. a piece of news, a dead battery on your phone at a critical moment or, especially for your case of strangle/straddles, a period without anything happening) could mean you lost everything. There are no stocks at the end of it you can recover 70-80% on.That said, at least when buying options you can ""only"" lose what you invest. Whatever you do, don't use leverage on options, sell options or look into futures till you know exactly what you're doing.

Every time you see a deal you believe can make you free money, somebody sold it believing it would make them money.There's no free win unfortunately - but fortunately there are also gamblers on the selling side.

,I have seen screenshots of people having puts and calls on the same stock at the same time. Wouldn't one just cancel put the other? Or is there something I am missing? Sorry if this is a stupid question. I have been doing well with amd and nvidia calls but am scared for Monday after today's skyrocket. I am not sure if the hype train will continue or if there will be a plummet. So I am trying to learn if there is any purpose of buying a put and a call at the same time,"With spy usually moving in small percentages, does using straddles really work? What kind of profits do you generally make in a day?",1,0.509,0.999,NEGATIVE

So I am trying to learn if there is any purpose of buying a put and a call at the same time,"I don’t trade like most people, I am generally trading between 50-200 contracts a day on spy. What I do is I target where the spy is headed in the short term and scalp between buying and selling channel tops/bottoms. Straddles help me immensely in this because when you get to the top/bottom of a channel, that is where a reversal or breakout is created so having a straddle to hedge against the alternative outcome is so very important. It’s important to note that the type of moves I’m looking for can be micro compared to what most traders want, some of the scalps I aim to clear can be within a range of .50¢ on the spyI can’t post an image or I’d show you a visual of what that looks like. Absolutely bonkers profit though, and throughout all my trading it’s some of the safest IF you can handle your emotions and play reactive, zero sitting on hands here, if your play goes wrong you get out/stop out immediately. I will make profit no matter what the day brings unless I play bad, which that can happen because we are all human",2,0.513,0.999,POSITIVE

META close 10/28/2022 $99.20Example Positions: 100 shares of META + 1x BTO 20221118 137C + 1x BTO 20221118 137PIf you held a straddle on META prior to 10/25 that covered over earnings you'd've been 100% hedged against the losses on your shares while if the shares had gone the opposite direction (I.e. 1/31 - 2/2) you'd've earned a large enough profit on your call to have paid for your put and then some.Straddles are great if there is a binary event coming up that you don't know which direction it is going to go and want to hedge your bets. Strangles are great if you think the stock will stay range bound between two strikes. And finally diagonal collars can be a great way of earning a return in a sideways market when you think the stock market might see a crash and want to protect yourself.,0,0.528,0.991,NEGATIVE

So I am trying to learn if there is any purpose of buying a put and a call at the same time,Simple answer:  You do it when you think there will be volatility on the stock but you aren't sure which way it will be on.  If there is enough volatility you still make enough to compensate for the cost on both sides.  ,0,0.541,0.965,NEGATIVE
