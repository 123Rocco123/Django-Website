I had more time for researching and doing DD and had dabbled with the stock before. It was trading at a PE in the low teens at the time, with steady growth. I bought with confidence. When nvidia took off, I realized I was sort of holding the shovel company during the gold rush. Smci ran so hard, so fast, that it literally caught me off guard a bit. Then the ole ‚Äúyou never go broke taking profits‚Äù kicked in, along with the ptsd of riding other investments all the way back down. Nothing fundamentally changed in my thesis or the company. Yet I sold it all. I try not to look too often anymore. Especially after it consolidated and gave me another entry that I passed on, which was and obvious mistake. It hurts. To this day, knowing when to sell a stock is the hardest part of the game for me. Live and learn. And be willing to constantly learn if your actively trading. The obvious answer; sell some.
