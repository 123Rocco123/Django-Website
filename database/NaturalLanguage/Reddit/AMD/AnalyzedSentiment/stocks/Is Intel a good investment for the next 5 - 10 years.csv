Where do you guys see this heading?","As someone who owns Intel: No. It's a speculative play, which means it cannot be considered a good investment unlike stocks such as Google, meta, etc.I really wish I could say it's a good investment but based on how secretive management was for the last three earnings by releasing info in parcels instead of giving the truth at Q4 results, how can I tell people with a straight face we won't learn of something bad again come the next earnings call? I'm in Intel for one reason which is their Arc GPUs. If they had simply provided us info regarding the foundry in the Q4 earnings report, things would be a lot better for me.And yes aside from arc GPUs, the foundry is there, but I don't know anything about how much revenue it can bring Intel. Therefore again, wait on the earnings report. What I find with these companies that are in hot water is that there is a low probability that earnings will turn things around. PayPal was not in hot water, it was just priced for zero growth. Dq, intc, and possibly net are in hot water and I've realized it's just a bad idea to double down before hearing of som good news.",0,0.543,1.0,NEGATIVE

They are buying machines and creating processes that will take several more years to complete. If they are successful in becoming the TSMC of the West then yes the stock could easily double or triple from here.I suspect that eventually the company will be forced to divest its fabs from its chip design business. Some activist investor will push for that.No one will use Intel's fabs when they also design chips - too easy to see competitors' designs and copy various aspects of them, even if Intel tries to convince its customers otherwise.That said, I think it's not a bad time to start building a position in them. The stock has reached max pessimism and they are not in danger of going bankrupt. They also have an extremely valuable IP portfolio so in any case I think they are trading far below intrinsic value at the moment.",0,0.563,1.0,NEGATIVE

This is a 20 billion dollar + facility. The things going on out there are cutting edge dont get me wrong its going to be quite sometime before its up and running but yeah.I believe china will invade taiwan at some point in the next 5-20 years.

The roadmap under Pat looks promising and sure if they make it happen it could have huge upside potential but thats a big if.
