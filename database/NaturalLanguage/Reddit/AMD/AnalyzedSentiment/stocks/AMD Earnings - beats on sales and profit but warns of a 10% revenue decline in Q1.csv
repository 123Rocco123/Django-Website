AMD’s estimate suggests a 10% decline in sales in the current quarter. It also said it expected its adjusted gross margin to be about 50%, a key metric for chipmakers like AMD. AMD reported earnings as many of its rival chipmakers have stumbled in recent weeks, citing lower consumer demand for finished electronics and gluts of parts needed to make PCs and servers. Intel, AMD’s primary competitor, reported a disastrous quarter last week that included a weak 2023 outlook. While AMD said it saw slow sales for its PC chips and graphics processors, it said its data center segment rose 42% year-over-year, suggesting it took market share from Intel. AMD attributed its beat to strong growth in its embedded and data center businesses, and said that its client revenue, or chips for PCs and laptops, and its gaming segment were down. AMD’s data center segment rose 42% year-over-year to $1.7 billion. Its embedded segment grew 1,868%, AMD said, because of sales from its purchase of Xilinx.

AMD's annual EPS is 3.50 / share. I'm assigning it a PE of 10-12 for fair price, because I got cold feet looking at Intel's PE.I've been following AMD since 2015, when rumors of Zen 1 first started floating around and they managed to stave off immediate bankruptcy risk through China's THATIC investment.The datacenter world is morphing now compared to even 3 years ago. The main entrant that is becoming a viable competitor is ARM. More so that the hyperscalers are developing their own in-house version.I believe there is 2 reasons to that: 1) they realize chips are the future, and the investment they make relative to the returns makes it worthwhile. Also they don't need a fab themselves, there's a third party fab that has more advanced working technology than Intel. Furthermore, customized chips may differentiate themselves and offer better competitive performance.2) hyperscalers can use their own in-house version to keep third-party chip prices down. Let's say AMD completely outcompetes Intel. Then AMD becomes the next monopoly. A monopoly over the CPU which is the heart of servers, in a world dependent on datacenters. There's no guarantee AMD won't do the same as Intel. So if the hyperscalers have a good enough chip, that can serve to deter exorbitant prices.3 years ago, I felt x86 was pretty much the only game, and there's only 2 players--Intel and AMD. 3 years later, I realized that the datacenter is changing so fast that x86 may no longer be the only game. Amazon can afford to subsidize their graviton, and I've no doubt Google and Microsoft both can as well.edit: and there's DPUs trying to offload the work from CPUs. I think AMD saw the writing on the wall so they bought Pensando.There's a possibility that AMD's growth will hit a wall sooner than expected, and if AMD gets assigned Intel type PE of 8-10, then including future EPS growth may be to 5-6 / share, then I would say fair value of shares is 40-60.Hence I don't really care what AMD's management is omitting, I'm not buying AMD at current price.",3,0.559,0.971,NEGATIVE
