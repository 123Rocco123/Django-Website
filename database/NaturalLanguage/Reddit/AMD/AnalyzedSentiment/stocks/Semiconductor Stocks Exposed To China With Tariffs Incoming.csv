,"Semiconductor stocks will come into focus in 2025 as geopolitical tensions rise. China is likely to retaliate following Trump’s most recent threats of 10% additional tariffs to all Chinese goods. This escalation in tariffs and retaliation is expected to have an impact on semiconductor sales in China, particularly affecting chipmakers with higher exposure to China. Nvidia, AMD and Micron have some of the lowest exposure among the leading chipmakers, while wafer fab equipment (WFE) manufacturers and Qualcomm have some of the highest exposure. https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2024/12/12/semiconductor-stocks-exposed-to-china-with-tariffs-incoming/","Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.To everyone commenting: Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.If you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on ""relevant subreddits"" and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They have expected their market share in China to drop to 20% in 2025 but the CFO didn’t have to clarify any further since they’ve complied with US to halt the exports. Now China is threatening ASML with a “long term exclusion” and it’s part of their “WOLF WARRIOR DIPLOMACY”.

Their revenues are lower than the bigger players.Here is how I personally rank the chip stocks based on revenues/margins/growth potential/geopolitical risk:Tier 1: Nvidia Tier 2: TSMC and Broadcom Tier 3: AMD and Marvell Tier 4: Arm, Amat, ASML, LRCX, KLAC, Micron, Qcom Tier 5: Intel (avoid)Nvidia is the king and most industry profits accrue up to them. TSM is the most important chip company on the planet (more than Nvidia) but it’ll always trade at a lower PE due to China risk. Broadcom was the clear #3 before yesterday’s ER and they’ve solidified that spot after what their CEO said yesterday about the growth potential.If you do not know much about this space, just buy Nvidia and/or SMH. You’ll hold all these names.It doesn’t really make sense IMO to hold ASML and most other manufacturers (with the exception of TSMC) since it’s harder for them to scale and China risk is significant. Also, all 5 tiers trade together (up and down together) so it’s best to focus on the ones that make the most revenue and profit. ASML, etc are struggling now and will crash again when all 5 Tiers crash in the coming years (the entire industry goes throw boom/bust cycles at least once a decade).",1,0.544,NEGATIVE,0.935
