,"Intel $INTC earnings beat expectations which suggest investors are willing to reward companies with strong fundamentals — and not penalize companies lagging behind in the AI race. This is good news for Apple $AAPL, Qualcomm $QCOM, and AMD $AMD. The benefits of AI are promising, but they are more long-term. AI is the future but investors need profits now, not just future potential. This gives Apple room to impress with fundamentals, even if they're behind in AI. The AI boom is real, but it's still in its early stages. AI leaders will dominate but traditional benchmarks still drive stock moves today. This gives Apple a headstart before AI capabilities become critical.","Qualcomm has a pretty strong foothold in the Android phones market, with their Snapdragon chip.
