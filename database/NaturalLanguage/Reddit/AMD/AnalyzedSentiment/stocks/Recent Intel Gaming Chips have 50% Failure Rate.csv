Intel is switching to a new node with 15th gen, after squeezing the living shit out of the old node for 12, 13 and 14 gen. This squeezing is probably whats causing the issues (though i dont have a deep understanding of the issues, i have watched the linked videos and some commentary on them). Will these issues carry through to the new gen? I would be surprised if they do but its not impossible.If there is no effect on the new gen things should balance out somewhat, but there will be some short term pain to go through. Before the medium term pain of not having their own fabs making their own chips. But surely theres no long term pain coming right? Right?Good thing i bought NVIDIA, AMD and Intel together back in 21.
