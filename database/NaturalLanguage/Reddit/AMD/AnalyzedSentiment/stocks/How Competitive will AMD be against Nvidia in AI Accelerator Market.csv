,"I've been delving into the specifics of AMD's New MI 300 platform and it appears to stack up favorably against the H100, often surpassing it in several aspects. However, there's an ongoing discussion about ROCm lagging behind CUDA, though AMD is vigorously working to bridge this software gap. Despite not being a semiconductor novice, I find myself drawn to AMD's chiplet-based design over Nvidia's monolithic approach. As we move toward smaller die sizes with High NA EUV, expertise in chiplet-based design will prove crucial, yielding numerous advantages. Additionally, AMD's ability to integrate different process nodes within the same package adds to cost efficiency. This discussion is pertinent due to the striking disparity in revenue estimates between AMD and Nvidia. The projections suggest Nvidia might achieve over six times the Accelerator revenue in 2027. It's worth noting that the actual figure could be even higher, considering that Data Center revenue encompasses enterprise CPU sales as well. Does anyone have any thoughts?","As you mentioned, the biggest issue is software, as it always has been for ML. I don't know if it's just as easy as making decent software. There's an ecosystem and switching costs. If your company is making a lot of money and spending a lot of money on developers, it's hard to justify using up dev time and increasing risk to switch.What could change this is a differentiated product, but I am not sure what that looks like.",0,0.54,0.999,NEGATIVE

AMD offers more VRAM at the same price point as NVIDIA, and VRAM is the limiting factor in generating the large LLMs that may prove revolutionary for many industries. NVIDIA, in contrast, is charging quite a bit for VRAM. As long as CUDA is necessary for big model training and deployment in servers, NVIDIA will be able to create artificial bottlenecks with VRAM and collect a large profit.The one thing ROCm has done right is minimize the need to adapt CUDA code for it - e.g. a codebase written using PyTorch will not need to be adapted much at all. So the cost to switch looks to have been addressed, what AMD must do now is give a compelling reason to do so by making ROCm a viable alternative for cheaper VRAM.",0,0.535,0.883,NEGATIVE

SDKs and community development is in some ways more important than the tech specs.For every AI project somewhere, there is a guy like me who spends a few weeks writing specifications, and then constructing a rough architecture, picking out major components like the GPU platform. I can tell you that AMD is behind Intel. At least Intel was doing something, no matter how pitiful it was, for the last few years. AMD is just fucked.A good sanity check is to check the popularity of developer forums. That shows you where the flock is going. They are all over at Nvidia, and not going anywhere.

Does anyone have any thoughts?","Are you talking in terms of current market share? The market is so new and there is so much demand. Unless you are talking about something else, this is not convincing.What specifically would prevent people from buying the MI300 or MI400 over the H100 or B100 that AMD would have difficulty addressing?From my perspective, AMD has a better design philosophy but worse software? However, AI software has been shifting towards inhouse software and open source, so Nvidia's advantage may be shrinking. I need to know what is wrong in this analysis.",3,0.566,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I've been delving into the specifics of AMD's New MI 300 platform and it appears to stack up favorably against the H100, often surpassing it in several aspects. However, there's an ongoing discussion about ROCm lagging behind CUDA, though AMD is vigorously working to bridge this software gap. Despite not being a semiconductor novice, I find myself drawn to AMD's chiplet-based design over Nvidia's monolithic approach. As we move toward smaller die sizes with High NA EUV, expertise in chiplet-based design will prove crucial, yielding numerous advantages. Additionally, AMD's ability to integrate different process nodes within the same package adds to cost efficiency. This discussion is pertinent due to the striking disparity in revenue estimates between AMD and Nvidia. The projections suggest Nvidia might achieve over six times the Accelerator revenue in 2027. It's worth noting that the actual figure could be even higher, considering that Data Center revenue encompasses enterprise CPU sales as well. Does anyone have any thoughts?",The GH200 will launch soon from Nvidia. The hardware race will continue,4,0.546,0.994,POSITIVE

Does anyone have any thoughts?",A GH 200 is just a Hopper GPU and a Grace CPU. It is not anything groundbreaking IMO.
