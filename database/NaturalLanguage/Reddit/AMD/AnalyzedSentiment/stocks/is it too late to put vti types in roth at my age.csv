,"I'm 54. I have $10k to invest right now. I am going to be putting 8k into my roth but want to buy some stocks in the roth with it. I was looking to get something like vti or one of those. But, is that a bad decision if I'm planning on retiring in 6-8 yrs. I live a very minimal lifestyle. But, I was bad with money in my younger years and have been much better in my last few decades. I always try to buy winter beaters for cars (live in NY). I have a 1000sq ft house which I think is too big for me alone, but oh well. It's paid for. I can put a decent amount of my paycheck away every week. I make about 70-80k per year with the ability to make over 100k, but I dont want to cause it's too many hours to put in (blue collar). I'm not married and have no expenses besides the usual taxes, food, etc. I have a 401k through my employer with fidelity. It is one of those 2030 (not sure of the number )plans where they manage it. I also have some individual stocks that I ""gamble"" with and am doing ok. I am planning on putting 8k into my roth and being done with that for the year. But, i want to get some stocks with that so the money isnt just sitting there. So , is vti or one of those a good choice? I have nvidia, apple, palintir, amd and some other small ones. Not sure what I will do with the other $2k. Thanks","If your 54, retiring in 8 yrs will put you right on mark to start collecting SS. Depend on your health condition u may then decide if its time to throw in the towel.And if ur time horizon is 6-8 years, VTI is an excellent ticker to invest in. In fact i think its better than anything else out there. I have been DCA (dollar cost average) into VTI for last 2 years, 1 share a week. Netting me about 104 shares (52 wks *2)u can see the result urself.Best luck out there.",0,0.523,0.987,POSITIVE

Thanks","I think this is a very good decision, you’re investing in an ETF so it’s very hard for the stock to fail (of course not impossible) when you buy VTI you are purchasing essentially the whole United States economy. If you’re looking for different ETFs you should check out QQQ, VOO, and SPY. I like VTI, bought a couple shares myself yesterday, also check out the other options listed above to see which one you like more :) With you buying with a 6-8 year time horizon and the market average of ETF’s you should double your initial investment by that time. When you sell it will be that amazing long term investment discount",0,0.548,0.996,POSITIVE
