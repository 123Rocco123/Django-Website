,"…than Nvidia? Class of its own in its products. Massive tailwind with this AI boom. Nearest competitor (AMD) is still years away from putting out a comparable product.

Over a 3year basis, hard to see this not going above $1k","Their earnings will grow more than 200% this year. Current estimates are for them to grow only ard 50% for FY24, but that’s enough to put the forward P/E at around 26x. Last Q their net profit margin was at 45.8% and this is expected to continue to improve into FY24.",3,0.587,0.996,POSITIVE

Over a 3year basis, hard to see this not going above $1k","76% Q2 2023 revenues was datacenter compute. Their big earner in that segment is the H100. In that quarter they shipped something like 300k units. They expect to ship another 200k units this year, and 1.5-2m units next year.At $33k per unit and 2m units that's 66bn revenues in 2024. Q2 2023 margins were unusually high at 45% but the margin on this product might just be better than what they used to sell. Historically the company earned 1-10bn per year, call it 5bn from normal operations. Add the 30bn in earnings from datacenter compute for 35bn earned in 2024.With the current float that's a P/E of about 30. As big tech stocks go that's not outrageous, and if you think 2025 will be even better than 2024 the current price of NVDA is not obviously unreasonable. I wouldn't call it a ""no brainer,"" but if you believe in the future of AI compute then it can make sense.",3,0.559,0.992,NEGATIVE

Over a 3year basis, hard to see this not going above $1k","> Over a 3year basis, hard to see this not going above $1kYou can't just assert that a company has tailwinds so stock price will go up. Look at AMZN through the dotcom bubble... AMZN's business continued to grow throughout the crash but their stock was still down 90% because investors over paid at the time, despite being right about the internet's and AMZN's long-term potential.NVDA is extremely expensive right now. It could very well grow into that valuation, but the real money has very likely already been made. It could continue to go up if the execute and the AI hype bares fruit, but if anything about the outlook changes it could easily crash 50-60%.I'm not bearish on the stock or anything, but it's not exactly a no-brainer. It's a high risk investment which gives you exposure to the AI hype. If that's what you want then great, but it's clearly not for everyone.",0,0.559,1.0,NEGATIVE
