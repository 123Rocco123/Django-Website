Earnings I’m watching: HOOD, (SHOP/DIS/CVS premarket)","Definitely agree with the soft consumer being a red flag, but overall ABNB seems like a bit of a mixed bag to me. Attractive pricing relative to historic PE but with softening consumer. I believe the thesis that travel will slow, however I believe that this will be temporary. Furthermore, they are hinting at offering more services to higher income client which will hopefully improve revenue in the long run. Overall, I think it’s a good long term holding, don’t own any at this point yet though.",2,0.525,0.994,NEGATIVE
