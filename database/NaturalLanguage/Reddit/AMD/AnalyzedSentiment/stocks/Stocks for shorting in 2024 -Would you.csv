I did really well shorting cloud software in 2021 into 2022. I do shares and puts but ive never really made money on puts, the timing is too difficult. Its not easy, I got beat on last year shorting and had to write down some losses.I do think theres opportunity at these elevated levels on some hype stuff.I see MDB, DDOG, CRWD, SNOW, TEAM, SHOP, NOW and a couple others on my list. Almost all are trading above 20 p/s. A downturn on customer software spending is going to hit these hard. The bull side is that the bubble can keep going for a lot longer, possibly years. I dont short biotech, small caps, or try to short anything headed for Bankruptcy because of the short squeeze potential. Also, nothing with high short interest. My 2 cents.",0,0.522,1.0,NEGATIVE

So you can set a stop loss of course, but you will inevitably close out some for what prove to be needless losses.I remember hearing Stan Druckenmiller say, 'Some of the best shorters I know have made decent money on the short side, but all of them have still made most of their money on the long side - the maths is just in your favour that way'.This also brings up the point that if you are short and something drops 50%, and then another 50%, you make 75%. Whereas if you are long and something goes up 50%, then another 50%, you make 125%.With all this said I do still find the idea of long-short portfolios interestingEdit: Actually it would be remiss not to mention the positive side of shorting, which is that you get cash, which could be deposited for 5% at today's rates, so you do get that little wind at your back (counter to that is you have to pay the dividends, if there are any). Or, if you've genuinely got a good long, then even if your short is not great, provided it loses less money than the long makes, you still win. So there's definitely a case for it. I just personally have not found a satisfactory way to handle the risk",3,0.523,0.999,NEGATIVE

OTM bear call spreads or OTM calls at a low enough delta gives me some tools to manage if the stocks continue to go up but I get the benefit of their previous volatility being high in 2023. Tend to aim for $100 a trade and close positions often to avoid holding anything through events or overnight if I can avoid it since these stocks run, pull back, and run. My advice would be to focus not on those big names which can stay at higher valuations for long times (NVDA, TSLA, etc), but other stocks that run hot. I played AVGO, LULU, LLY, and ULTA recently at their ATH and usually picked up a nice $1-2k after a few trades.",0,0.52,0.717,NEGATIVE
