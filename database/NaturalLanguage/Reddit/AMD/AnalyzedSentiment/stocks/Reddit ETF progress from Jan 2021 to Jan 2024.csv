I highly doubt there's many (if any) redditors who would have actually bought all of these individual stocks.That said, this portfolio is heavily weighted towards speculative stocks that aren't making much (if any) profits as of yet. So many of the stocks got hit pretty hard by all the rate hikes since it was made, much more so then the average company in the indexes. So of course it's going to be a big loser in a high interest rate environment, it's frankly surprising that it's ONLY down by 16%.NVDA, AMD, and AAPL are the only things carrying this portfolio. If this portfolio didn't have a bunch of money burning companies that depend on low interest rates then those stocks could have potentially carried the portfolio to out performance.",2,0.552,1.0,NEGATIVE

Social media is largely group think. What gets upvotes is what is visible. The stuff that gets upvotes and attention is what people see as the narrative in subreddits, downvoted and buried comments/posts do not really have any influence on the subreddit at large.So the reason that this particular group of stocks are here together is because of the momentum that they had at the time of the original post. So 2022 or 2023 is irrelevant, because the list of stocks recommended by this subreddit would be completely different.

I didn't choose or time anything, just like I'm not cherry picking update posts. I just make the post whenever I think about it in January and use the previous day's close.OP said ""here's the Reddit ETF, this is what the sub consensus says you should buy right now,"" everyone agreed with him, and then I tracked that.This is part of the lesson. Social media collectives are clueless, and even moreso when it comes to timing. The fact that everyone was clamoring to buy these stocks almost immediately before the cliff tells you everything you need to know. You and the person I replied to are now saying ""sure, but if instead of buying it back then, someone instead bought at the perfect bottom, they would be up big!"" That statement has no meaning though, you could say that about almost every single stock.There has been a tiny window of time in which this ETF has outpaced the market, but there has never been a time in which buying this ETF was a good idea.",3,0.54,0.956,NEGATIVE
