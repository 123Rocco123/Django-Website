How much could they grow from now on? Ik that 16 USD isn't too much but, for me is still something if I get let's say 20-25 back when selling","Kodak went from $130 im the 1980’s to $10 in about 1.5 years. “The numbers look good, it’s a solid company, it can’t possibly keep going down, it’s a huge company it can’t lose more money, it hasn’t gone under what I purchased at” were all excuses used for people who kept purchasing on its way down. As you can imagine they lost money.Peter Lynch’s “On Beating Wall Street” has several chapters dedicated to this line of thinking, specifically pointing to the Kodak case. AMD is doing well in the numbers compared to who? The entire stock market? Their industry? Their historical averages? Hibbett (a sports retailer) has positive numbers if you compare it to bank stocks but if you compare it to its industry… not really.I hope this bet works out for you, but from the sounds of how limited your analysis is, do be aware it does sound like you’re taking on a big risk. Positive numbers (without comparing them to anything or using ratios that are more telling), and a growth rate (Hibbett was growing and went from >$60 to <$35 in a year) is a limited analysis. Again though, wish you all the best and hope this trade does work out for you!",1,0.549,0.848,NEGATIVE
