,"Below is my novice attempt at providing half-decent DD in support a thesis. Two caveats: 1) I wanted to focus on US-based companies, and 2) This is a play in my Roth IRA – Buy and Hold long term. Reading the book CHIP WARS changed my portfolio and investment strategy. I’d heard of TSMC, AMD and NVDA, but wasn’t really sure how to quantify their value or compare against one another other than stock price (NVDA must be the best one, right?). According to the author, chips are the new gold, and will shape the global power alignment for the next couple decades. The book talks a ton about the history of semiconductors and the processes needed to create them, then and now, highlighting several key dependencies in the manufacturing and supply chain that I thought would represent potential targets for investment. I began researching the supply chain in greater detail in the hopes of making it easier for a non-technical guy like me to understand the holistic system from a systems theory approach. A Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) article had a few graphics that helped The article. First is the value chain showing the 3 steps to chip creation; design, fabrication, and Assembly, Test, and Packaging (ATP). Cool, now I just find out who does all of these things and invest, right? Not saying that wouldn’t work, but I’m kind of looking for an undervalued company with potential to grow (NVDA is out of my league at ~500/share, and probably overpriced). There are a lot of companies that compete in these spaces, some in one, many in multiple. Design: I focused on Design and Fabrication. There may be diamonds in the rough for ATP, but it was quite a bit broad in my initial research, and hard to narrow down/nothing stood out. Starting with Design, the CSIS article provided a good starting point with a list of several major players. The same article stated that “in the US and UK, Intel, ARM, and Cadence were core leaders in Intellectual property. For that reason, they were the three I chose to focus on. Fabrication: Fabrication plants (Fabs) are the most critical physical component in the manufacturing process, and there is a disproportionate dependency on TSMC fabs in Taiwan. There could be another post on the potential for China/Taiwan issues having a significant impact on the chip market, but for now, I will just highlight that the smallest chips in the world currently in mass production (3nm) are produced in TSMC and Samsung Fabs, making them key centers of gravity in the semi world. But fabs are simply another “system” in the larger system… What are they made of? The three key components for fabs are lithography machines, ultra-pure air, and ultra-pure water. So I began to look at what companies specialize in those areas… Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography (ASML) has a basic monopoly on Lithography machines, and recently sold its next generation lithography machines to Intel (more on that below). There are no shortage of Water and Air manufacturing companies. Again, focusing on US based companies, I arrived at Air Products ($APD), Hitachi ($HTHIY), and Xylem ($XYL). US based APD has been relatively stagnant, but HTHIY has been on a general uptrend for a couple years now. This maybe an option as I get more comfortable with investments with overseas companies, but for now I move on to water. XYL hasn’t shown a lot of movement, but they do offer a small dividend. Still, not enough potential for growth in my opinion. So, we have INTC with a ton of intellectual property and next generation Fab capabilities on the horizon. One final step before dumping my IRA into INTC; CEO research? I evaluated three basic components – Who is the CEO, what he’s saying, and what he’s actually doing about it... The CEO: If there was a “Chips hall of fame,” Pat Gelsinger would be in it. He started at Intel in 1979, and has since made pit stops at several huge tech companies (e.g. VM Ware) along his way back to being named CEO in 2021. Bottom Line: Dude understands the industry and the company inner workings well. What he’s saying: He’s put out several bold statements in the last couple years regarding Intel falling behind in AI, and wanting to catch up quickly. His product line going through intel right now is impressive, he’s doubling down on US-based production, and should compete with the major names in the AI Chips space in the near future with intel 4 CPUs and Meteor Lake CPUs. What he’s doing: Pat Gelsingers major investments are currently focused on manufacturing, emphasizing bringing more chip production to the US. In Arizona, Intel invested $30 billion in two chip factories in Chandler. This is their biggest commitment to domestic chip production, and will produce advanced chips. As I mentioned above, Intel will be the first company to get the EUV lithography tool with a 0.55 numeric aperture (high-NA) from ASML this year and it's also going to obtain the majority of the company's machines in 2024. (What does high NA mean? Link below in comments) A unique opportunity associated with these new high-NA machines is the need for a lot of instrumentation and calibration. MKS Instruments ($MKSI) has been a long-time partner of Intel, and actually have a large location in Beaverton, Oregon, about 10 miles from the new Lithography machines location in at the Intel facility in Hillsboro, Oregon. MKSI has moved with INTC over the last few weeks as a sympathy play, but is approaching a $110 resistance line. If it gets through that, there is quite a bit of room to run prior to ATHs. They also pay a small dividend (1.29%). Maybe a side play with a LEAPS contract or two. My plan is pretty simple, I think. Put 7K contribution into INTC (140 shares at $50). This will bring me to a total of 340 shares. Sell 3x Jan 26 $60 strike covered calls (~$8 each) and put the $2400 in premium back into more INTC shares. I'm sure I screwed some stuff up, and satisficed my way into an INTC outcome, but this was my zig zag research process. (edit) TL;DR: INTC is likely to move up in the chip space as they prioritize next gen fabrication and AI. New fabs in Ohio, Israel, and Germany. My $7K IRA contribution this year is going all to INTC shares.","Thanks for the DD. I got into Intel in 2022. They’re also building 2 fabs in Ohio, 1 in Germany, and 1 in Israel.

He started at Intel in 1979, and has since made pit stops at several huge tech companies (e.g. VM Ware) along his way back to being named CEO in 2021. Bottom Line: Dude understands the industry and the company inner workings well. What he’s saying: He’s put out several bold statements in the last couple years regarding Intel falling behind in AI, and wanting to catch up quickly. His product line going through intel right now is impressive, he’s doubling down on US-based production, and should compete with the major names in the AI Chips space in the near future with intel 4 CPUs and Meteor Lake CPUs. What he’s doing: Pat Gelsingers major investments are currently focused on manufacturing, emphasizing bringing more chip production to the US. In Arizona, Intel invested $30 billion in two chip factories in Chandler. This is their biggest commitment to domestic chip production, and will produce advanced chips. As I mentioned above, Intel will be the first company to get the EUV lithography tool with a 0.55 numeric aperture (high-NA) from ASML this year and it's also going to obtain the majority of the company's machines in 2024.

In Arizona, Intel invested $30 billion in two chip factories in Chandler. This is their biggest commitment to domestic chip production, and will produce advanced chips. As I mentioned above, Intel will be the first company to get the EUV lithography tool with a 0.55 numeric aperture (high-NA) from ASML this year and it's also going to obtain the majority of the company's machines in 2024.

There may be diamonds in the rough for ATP, but it was quite a bit broad in my initial research, and hard to narrow down/nothing stood out. Starting with Design, the CSIS article provided a good starting point with a list of several major players. The same article stated that “in the US and UK, Intel, ARM, and Cadence were core leaders in Intellectual property. For that reason, they were the three I chose to focus on.

One final step before dumping my IRA into INTC; CEO research? I evaluated three basic components – Who is the CEO, what he’s saying, and what he’s actually doing about it...

He started at Intel in 1979, and has since made pit stops at several huge tech companies (e.g. VM Ware) along his way back to being named CEO in 2021. Bottom Line: Dude understands the industry and the company inner workings well. What he’s saying: He’s put out several bold statements in the last couple years regarding Intel falling behind in AI, and wanting to catch up quickly. His product line going through intel right now is impressive, he’s doubling down on US-based production, and should compete with the major names in the AI Chips space in the near future with intel 4 CPUs and Meteor Lake CPUs. What he’s doing: Pat Gelsingers major investments are currently focused on manufacturing, emphasizing bringing more chip production to the US. In Arizona, Intel invested $30 billion in two chip factories in Chandler. This is their biggest commitment to domestic chip production, and will produce advanced chips. As I mentioned above, Intel will be the first company to get the EUV lithography tool with a 0.55 numeric aperture (high-NA) from ASML this year and it's also going to obtain the majority of the company's machines in 2024. (What does high NA mean? Link below in comments) A unique opportunity associated with these new high-NA machines is the need for a lot of instrumentation and calibration.

There could be another post on the potential for China/Taiwan issues having a significant impact on the chip market, but for now, I will just highlight that the smallest chips in the world currently in mass production (3nm) are produced in TSMC and Samsung Fabs, making them key centers of gravity in the semi world.

There are no shortage of Water and Air manufacturing companies. Again, focusing on US based companies, I arrived at Air Products ($APD), Hitachi ($HTHIY), and Xylem ($XYL).

One final step before dumping my IRA into INTC; CEO research? I evaluated three basic components – Who is the CEO, what he’s saying, and what he’s actually doing about it... The CEO: If there was a “Chips hall of fame,” Pat Gelsinger would be in it. He started at Intel in 1979, and has since made pit stops at several huge tech companies (e.g. VM Ware) along his way back to being named CEO in 2021. Bottom Line: Dude understands the industry and the company inner workings well. What he’s saying: He’s put out several bold statements in the last couple years regarding Intel falling behind in AI, and wanting to catch up quickly. His product line going through intel right now is impressive, he’s doubling down on US-based production, and should compete with the major names in the AI Chips space in the near future with intel 4 CPUs and Meteor Lake CPUs. What he’s doing: Pat Gelsingers major investments are currently focused on manufacturing, emphasizing bringing more chip production to the US. In Arizona, Intel invested $30 billion in two chip factories in Chandler. This is their biggest commitment to domestic chip production, and will produce advanced chips. As I mentioned above, Intel will be the first company to get the EUV lithography tool with a 0.55 numeric aperture (high-NA) from ASML this year and it's also going to obtain the majority of the company's machines in 2024. (What does high NA mean? Link below in comments) A unique opportunity associated with these new high-NA machines is the need for a lot of instrumentation and calibration. MKS Instruments ($MKSI) has been a long-time partner of Intel, and actually have a large location in Beaverton, Oregon, about 10 miles from the new Lithography machines location in at the Intel facility in Hillsboro, Oregon. MKSI has moved with INTC over the last few weeks as a sympathy play, but is approaching a $110 resistance line. If it gets through that, there is quite a bit of room to run prior to ATHs. They also pay a small dividend (1.29%). Maybe a side play with a LEAPS contract or two. My plan is pretty simple, I think. Put 7K contribution into INTC (140 shares at $50). This will bring me to a total of 340 shares. Sell 3x Jan 26 $60 strike covered calls (~$8 each) and put the $2400 in premium back into more INTC shares. I'm sure I screwed some stuff up, and satisficed my way into an INTC outcome, but this was my zig zag research process. (edit) TL;DR: INTC is likely to move up in the chip space as they prioritize next gen fabrication and AI. New fabs in Ohio, Israel, and Germany. My $7K IRA contribution this year is going all to INTC shares.","its below 20 now, go all in lol",1,0.502,0.802,NEGATIVE

Allow me to give you the perspective of an old IT industry pro.That company was the leader 50 years ago and there was no one else for decades. AMD started by making cheap clones but were ignored by Intel like a flea on an elephant. For decades they were just printing money. Intel was “inside” everything. They just fell asleep at the wheel. Sorry but you just don’t come back from that. Dozens of other companies from that era missed the boat and they are either gone or a shadow of themselves.IBM used to be #1 for decades. Biggest company in the world. Now a shadow. DEC was #2 computer company for decades and used to make the most innovative chips and systems in the world. Many still in use. Gone. Purchased by an IBM PC clone maker by the name of Compaq. Gone. Purchased by HP. Now a shadow of themselves. I can speak with some knowledge on the subject as I worked for both DEC and IBM for more years than I want to remember. Yes. Jurassic park here.So answer me. Is GM or Ford going to be the leader in EVs and beat Tesla? Is Yahoo is going to take back the search crown from google? Is Lotus 123 going to take back dominance in spreadsheets from Microsoft? If not why would anyone bet on a relic like Intel being in the same league as Nvidia or AMD let alone be the future of chips. They are the past. 40 years ago…great idea……2024….not so much.Some things get better with age. Wine. Buildings. Books. Art. Cities. But chip firms aren’t one of them. Technology cycles are getting shorter and shorter. The next Nvidia and AMD is out there. Go forth and find it young one. When you do please do me a favor and don’t tell me because I’m just too darn old. Good luck.,0,0.546,0.959,NEGATIVE

I absolutely hear what you’re saying and don’t discount it by there are unique factors at play.If Intel was attempting to get competitive again in all of its sectors at once and was competing at them all then I would totally agree. However AMD and NVIDA don’t just not compete with intels fabs in the sense intels are better, they don’t compete because they simply don’t fab there own chips. AMD and invida could eat intel’s lunch in every other regard and that would not change.I’m fact there isn’t a major chip fab here that has the capacity to even supply the chips needed domestically. Even if intels fabs are shit (which they arnt) there is simply a supply constraint. Now obviously TSM blows Intel out of the water when we move internationally (I own a significant position there as well) but in the next 10 years the west will want peace of mind that it’s chips are produced close to home and can’t be disrupted. Even TSM knows this and it’s why they are attempting to move some of its fabs to the west both in the US and Europe. However unlike Intel they are a key part of Taiwan’s national defense strategy and Taiwan will never let them move significant production of high end chips over.The companies you listed were demand constrained. IBM was huge, but as you pointed out new companies quickly formed and gave new better supply. Demand was filled and no one wanted sub par computers.Same with ford and GM. There can only be so much demand for cars. Especially new cars. If you start making shitty cars and other companies make better ones (TSLA is actually not the right comparison they didn’t kill ford and GM Japanese and European auto makers did) then you simply won’t sell new cars.But what if a new company tries to enter the chip fab space? Well unless they are willing to partner with TSM and TSM is will to partner with them, then they will need tens to hundreds of billions of dollars just to get of the ground. That is intel’s biggest moat. The barrier to enter is to the chip fab space is light years bigger then the barrier for design. AMD can start making cheap clone designs. They cannot start making cheap fabs.All of your examples were companies able to exploit a market leader with a lower barrier of entry or in the case of ford and GM were killed by other competitors who simply finally got access to American markets. There is no hidden company in the wings waiting to sell chip fab space to the west.This isn’t to say what you have to add isn’t valid and shouldn’t be considered. Lots of Intel fan boys have varying lofty expectations on intel’s other business but in terms of fabs I agree with them.I definitely appreciate the insight it’s great to hear that perspective",1,0.538,0.999,NEGATIVE

According to the author, chips are the new gold, and will shape the global power alignment for the next couple decades.

Not saying that wouldn’t work, but I’m kind of looking for an undervalued company with potential to grow (NVDA is out of my league at ~500/share, and probably overpriced). There are a lot of companies that compete in these spaces, some in one, many in multiple. Design: I focused on Design and Fabrication. There may be diamonds in the rough for ATP, but it was quite a bit broad in my initial research, and hard to narrow down/nothing stood out. Starting with Design, the CSIS article provided a good starting point with a list of several major players. The same article stated that “in the US and UK, Intel, ARM, and Cadence were core leaders in Intellectual property. For that reason, they were the three I chose to focus on. Fabrication: Fabrication plants (Fabs) are the most critical physical component in the manufacturing process, and there is a disproportionate dependency on TSMC fabs in Taiwan. There could be another post on the potential for China/Taiwan issues having a significant impact on the chip market, but for now, I will just highlight that the smallest chips in the world currently in mass production (3nm) are produced in TSMC and Samsung Fabs, making them key centers of gravity in the semi world. But fabs are simply another “system” in the larger system… What are they made of? The three key components for fabs are lithography machines, ultra-pure air, and ultra-pure water. So I began to look at what companies specialize in those areas… Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography (ASML) has a basic monopoly on Lithography machines, and recently sold its next generation lithography machines to Intel (more on that below). There are no shortage of Water and Air manufacturing companies. Again, focusing on US based companies, I arrived at Air Products ($APD), Hitachi ($HTHIY), and Xylem ($XYL). US based APD has been relatively stagnant, but HTHIY has been on a general uptrend for a couple years now. This maybe an option as I get more comfortable with investments with overseas companies, but for now I move on to water. XYL hasn’t shown a lot of movement, but they do offer a small dividend. Still, not enough potential for growth in my opinion. So, we have INTC with a ton of intellectual property and next generation Fab capabilities on the horizon. One final step before dumping my IRA into INTC; CEO research? I evaluated three basic components – Who is the CEO, what he’s saying, and what he’s actually doing about it... The CEO: If there was a “Chips hall of fame,” Pat Gelsinger would be in it. He started at Intel in 1979, and has since made pit stops at several huge tech companies (e.g. VM Ware) along his way back to being named CEO in 2021. Bottom Line: Dude understands the industry and the company inner workings well. What he’s saying: He’s put out several bold statements in the last couple years regarding Intel falling behind in AI, and wanting to catch up quickly. His product line going through intel right now is impressive, he’s doubling down on US-based production, and should compete with the major names in the AI Chips space in the near future with intel 4 CPUs and Meteor Lake CPUs. What he’s doing: Pat Gelsingers major investments are currently focused on manufacturing, emphasizing bringing more chip production to the US. In Arizona, Intel invested $30 billion in two chip factories in Chandler. This is their biggest commitment to domestic chip production, and will produce advanced chips. As I mentioned above, Intel will be the first company to get the EUV lithography tool with a 0.55 numeric aperture (high-NA) from ASML this year and it's also going to obtain the majority of the company's machines in 2024. (What does high NA mean? Link below in comments) A unique opportunity associated with these new high-NA machines is the need for a lot of instrumentation and calibration. MKS Instruments ($MKSI) has been a long-time partner of Intel, and actually have a large location in Beaverton, Oregon, about 10 miles from the new Lithography machines location in at the Intel facility in Hillsboro, Oregon. MKSI has moved with INTC over the last few weeks as a sympathy play, but is approaching a $110 resistance line. If it gets through that, there is quite a bit of room to run prior to ATHs. They also pay a small dividend (1.29%). Maybe a side play with a LEAPS contract or two. My plan is pretty simple, I think. Put 7K contribution into INTC (140 shares at $50).

,"Below is my novice attempt at providing half-decent DD in support a thesis. Two caveats: 1) I wanted to focus on US-based companies, and 2) This is a play in my Roth IRA – Buy and Hold long term. Reading the book CHIP WARS changed my portfolio and investment strategy. I’d heard of TSMC, AMD and NVDA, but wasn’t really sure how to quantify their value or compare against one another other than stock price (NVDA must be the best one, right?). According to the author, chips are the new gold, and will shape the global power alignment for the next couple decades. The book talks a ton about the history of semiconductors and the processes needed to create them, then and now, highlighting several key dependencies in the manufacturing and supply chain that I thought would represent potential targets for investment. I began researching the supply chain in greater detail in the hopes of making it easier for a non-technical guy like me to understand the holistic system from a systems theory approach. A Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) article had a few graphics that helped The article. First is the value chain showing the 3 steps to chip creation; design, fabrication, and Assembly, Test, and Packaging (ATP). Cool, now I just find out who does all of these things and invest, right? Not saying that wouldn’t work, but I’m kind of looking for an undervalued company with potential to grow (NVDA is out of my league at ~500/share, and probably overpriced). There are a lot of companies that compete in these spaces, some in one, many in multiple. Design: I focused on Design and Fabrication. There may be diamonds in the rough for ATP, but it was quite a bit broad in my initial research, and hard to narrow down/nothing stood out. Starting with Design, the CSIS article provided a good starting point with a list of several major players. The same article stated that “in the US and UK, Intel, ARM, and Cadence were core leaders in Intellectual property. For that reason, they were the three I chose to focus on. Fabrication: Fabrication plants (Fabs) are the most critical physical component in the manufacturing process, and there is a disproportionate dependency on TSMC fabs in Taiwan. There could be another post on the potential for China/Taiwan issues having a significant impact on the chip market, but for now, I will just highlight that the smallest chips in the world currently in mass production (3nm) are produced in TSMC and Samsung Fabs, making them key centers of gravity in the semi world. But fabs are simply another “system” in the larger system… What are they made of? The three key components for fabs are lithography machines, ultra-pure air, and ultra-pure water. So I began to look at what companies specialize in those areas… Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography (ASML) has a basic monopoly on Lithography machines, and recently sold its next generation lithography machines to Intel (more on that below). There are no shortage of Water and Air manufacturing companies. Again, focusing on US based companies, I arrived at Air Products ($APD), Hitachi ($HTHIY), and Xylem ($XYL). US based APD has been relatively stagnant, but HTHIY has been on a general uptrend for a couple years now. This maybe an option as I get more comfortable with investments with overseas companies, but for now I move on to water. XYL hasn’t shown a lot of movement, but they do offer a small dividend. Still, not enough potential for growth in my opinion. So, we have INTC with a ton of intellectual property and next generation Fab capabilities on the horizon. One final step before dumping my IRA into INTC; CEO research? I evaluated three basic components – Who is the CEO, what he’s saying, and what he’s actually doing about it... The CEO: If there was a “Chips hall of fame,” Pat Gelsinger would be in it. He started at Intel in 1979, and has since made pit stops at several huge tech companies (e.g. VM Ware) along his way back to being named CEO in 2021. Bottom Line: Dude understands the industry and the company inner workings well. What he’s saying: He’s put out several bold statements in the last couple years regarding Intel falling behind in AI, and wanting to catch up quickly. His product line going through intel right now is impressive, he’s doubling down on US-based production, and should compete with the major names in the AI Chips space in the near future with intel 4 CPUs and Meteor Lake CPUs. What he’s doing: Pat Gelsingers major investments are currently focused on manufacturing, emphasizing bringing more chip production to the US. In Arizona, Intel invested $30 billion in two chip factories in Chandler. This is their biggest commitment to domestic chip production, and will produce advanced chips. As I mentioned above, Intel will be the first company to get the EUV lithography tool with a 0.55 numeric aperture (high-NA) from ASML this year and it's also going to obtain the majority of the company's machines in 2024. (What does high NA mean? Link below in comments) A unique opportunity associated with these new high-NA machines is the need for a lot of instrumentation and calibration. MKS Instruments ($MKSI) has been a long-time partner of Intel, and actually have a large location in Beaverton, Oregon, about 10 miles from the new Lithography machines location in at the Intel facility in Hillsboro, Oregon. MKSI has moved with INTC over the last few weeks as a sympathy play, but is approaching a $110 resistance line. If it gets through that, there is quite a bit of room to run prior to ATHs. They also pay a small dividend (1.29%). Maybe a side play with a LEAPS contract or two. My plan is pretty simple, I think. Put 7K contribution into INTC (140 shares at $50). This will bring me to a total of 340 shares. Sell 3x Jan 26 $60 strike covered calls (~$8 each) and put the $2400 in premium back into more INTC shares. I'm sure I screwed some stuff up, and satisficed my way into an INTC outcome, but this was my zig zag research process.

The most expensive and important part in this is not manufacturing anymore, its packing. Its the most labor intensive part which is why its done in asia since its cheap.

First is the value chain showing the 3 steps to chip creation; design, fabrication, and Assembly, Test, and Packaging (ATP). Cool, now I just find out who does all of these things and invest, right? Not saying that wouldn’t work, but I’m kind of looking for an undervalued company with potential to grow (NVDA is out of my league at ~500/share, and probably overpriced). There are a lot of companies that compete in these spaces, some in one, many in multiple. Design: I focused on Design and Fabrication. There may be diamonds in the rough for ATP, but it was quite a bit broad in my initial research, and hard to narrow down/nothing stood out. Starting with Design, the CSIS article provided a good starting point with a list of several major players. The same article stated that “in the US and UK, Intel, ARM, and Cadence were core leaders in Intellectual property. For that reason, they were the three I chose to focus on. Fabrication: Fabrication plants (Fabs) are the most critical physical component in the manufacturing process, and there is a disproportionate dependency on TSMC fabs in Taiwan. There could be another post on the potential for China/Taiwan issues having a significant impact on the chip market, but for now, I will just highlight that the smallest chips in the world currently in mass production (3nm) are produced in TSMC and Samsung Fabs, making them key centers of gravity in the semi world. But fabs are simply another “system” in the larger system… What are they made of? The three key components for fabs are lithography machines, ultra-pure air, and ultra-pure water. So I began to look at what companies specialize in those areas… Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography (ASML) has a basic monopoly on Lithography machines, and recently sold its next generation lithography machines to Intel (more on that below). There are no shortage of Water and Air manufacturing companies. Again, focusing on US based companies, I arrived at Air Products ($APD), Hitachi ($HTHIY), and Xylem ($XYL). US based APD has been relatively stagnant, but HTHIY has been on a general uptrend for a couple years now. This maybe an option as I get more comfortable with investments with overseas companies, but for now I move on to water. XYL hasn’t shown a lot of movement, but they do offer a small dividend. Still, not enough potential for growth in my opinion. So, we have INTC with a ton of intellectual property and next generation Fab capabilities on the horizon. One final step before dumping my IRA into INTC; CEO research? I evaluated three basic components – Who is the CEO, what he’s saying, and what he’s actually doing about it... The CEO: If there was a “Chips hall of fame,” Pat Gelsinger would be in it. He started at Intel in 1979, and has since made pit stops at several huge tech companies (e.g. VM Ware) along his way back to being named CEO in 2021. Bottom Line: Dude understands the industry and the company inner workings well. What he’s saying: He’s put out several bold statements in the last couple years regarding Intel falling behind in AI, and wanting to catch up quickly. His product line going through intel right now is impressive, he’s doubling down on US-based production, and should compete with the major names in the AI Chips space in the near future with intel 4 CPUs and Meteor Lake CPUs. What he’s doing: Pat Gelsingers major investments are currently focused on manufacturing, emphasizing bringing more chip production to the US. In Arizona, Intel invested $30 billion in two chip factories in Chandler. This is their biggest commitment to domestic chip production, and will produce advanced chips. As I mentioned above, Intel will be the first company to get the EUV lithography tool with a 0.55 numeric aperture (high-NA) from ASML this year and it's also going to obtain the majority of the company's machines in 2024. (What does high NA mean? Link below in comments) A unique opportunity associated with these new high-NA machines is the need for a lot of instrumentation and calibration. MKS Instruments ($MKSI) has been a long-time partner of Intel, and actually have a large location in Beaverton, Oregon, about 10 miles from the new Lithography machines location in at the Intel facility in Hillsboro, Oregon. MKSI has moved with INTC over the last few weeks as a sympathy play, but is approaching a $110 resistance line. If it gets through that, there is quite a bit of room to run prior to ATHs. They also pay a small dividend (1.29%). Maybe a side play with a LEAPS contract or two. My plan is pretty simple, I think. Put 7K contribution into INTC (140 shares at $50). This will bring me to a total of 340 shares. Sell 3x Jan 26 $60 strike covered calls (~$8 each) and put the $2400 in premium back into more INTC shares. I'm sure I screwed some stuff up, and satisficed my way into an INTC outcome, but this was my zig zag research process. (edit) TL;DR: INTC is likely to move up in the chip space as they prioritize next gen fabrication and AI. New fabs in Ohio, Israel, and Germany. My $7K IRA contribution this year is going all to INTC shares.","This is somewhat late but I wanted to see if you had an update on INTC as the share price is catering.The financials for INTC look horrible. There is nearly a 40% drop in revenues since 2019 and profit margins have largely disappeared. I'm not sure exactly what's going on but it looks like their computer chips business is becoming commoditized. Revenues for chips in desktops/laptops is doing okay but they are lagging in data center (dominated by NVDA) and network/edge computing.Long term, I think desktop/laptop chips will be commoditized and data center (including AI chips) will be the rage. At a current 80B market cap, it isn't even really that cheap right now at a 42 P/E. If we assume earnings normalize, I estimate the P/E could be around 16 which still isn't that cheap.Pat Gelsinger is a great guy but typically these huge corporations ossify and even the best CEO can't change course. Do you know if they fixed their manufacturing issues yet?",0,0.535,1.0,NEGATIVE

There are a lot of companies that compete in these spaces, some in one, many in multiple. Design: I focused on Design and Fabrication. There may be diamonds in the rough for ATP, but it was quite a bit broad in my initial research, and hard to narrow down/nothing stood out. Starting with Design, the CSIS article provided a good starting point with a list of several major players. The same article stated that “in the US and UK, Intel, ARM, and Cadence were core leaders in Intellectual property. For that reason, they were the three I chose to focus on. Fabrication: Fabrication plants (Fabs) are the most critical physical component in the manufacturing process, and there is a disproportionate dependency on TSMC fabs in Taiwan. There could be another post on the potential for China/Taiwan issues having a significant impact on the chip market, but for now, I will just highlight that the smallest chips in the world currently in mass production (3nm) are produced in TSMC and Samsung Fabs, making them key centers of gravity in the semi world. But fabs are simply another “system” in the larger system… What are they made of? The three key components for fabs are lithography machines, ultra-pure air, and ultra-pure water. So I began to look at what companies specialize in those areas… Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography (ASML) has a basic monopoly on Lithography machines, and recently sold its next generation lithography machines to Intel (more on that below). There are no shortage of Water and Air manufacturing companies. Again, focusing on US based companies, I arrived at Air Products ($APD), Hitachi ($HTHIY), and Xylem ($XYL).

One final step before dumping my IRA into INTC; CEO research? I evaluated three basic components – Who is the CEO, what he’s saying, and what he’s actually doing about it... The CEO: If there was a “Chips hall of fame,” Pat Gelsinger would be in it. He started at Intel in 1979, and has since made pit stops at several huge tech companies (e.g. VM Ware) along his way back to being named CEO in 2021. Bottom Line: Dude understands the industry and the company inner workings well. What he’s saying: He’s put out several bold statements in the last couple years regarding Intel falling behind in AI, and wanting to catch up quickly. His product line going through intel right now is impressive, he’s doubling down on US-based production, and should compete with the major names in the AI Chips space in the near future with intel 4 CPUs and Meteor Lake CPUs. What he’s doing: Pat Gelsingers major investments are currently focused on manufacturing, emphasizing bringing more chip production to the US. In Arizona, Intel invested $30 billion in two chip factories in Chandler. This is their biggest commitment to domestic chip production, and will produce advanced chips. As I mentioned above, Intel will be the first company to get the EUV lithography tool with a 0.55 numeric aperture (high-NA) from ASML this year and it's also going to obtain the majority of the company's machines in 2024. (What does high NA mean? Link below in comments) A unique opportunity associated with these new high-NA machines is the need for a lot of instrumentation and calibration. MKS Instruments ($MKSI) has been a long-time partner of Intel, and actually have a large location in Beaverton, Oregon, about 10 miles from the new Lithography machines location in at the Intel facility in Hillsboro, Oregon. MKSI has moved with INTC over the last few weeks as a sympathy play, but is approaching a $110 resistance line. If it gets through that, there is quite a bit of room to run prior to ATHs. They also pay a small dividend (1.29%). Maybe a side play with a LEAPS contract or two. My plan is pretty simple, I think. Put 7K contribution into INTC (140 shares at $50).

Reading the book CHIP WARS changed my portfolio and investment strategy. I’d heard of TSMC, AMD and NVDA, but wasn’t really sure how to quantify their value or compare against one another other than stock price (NVDA must be the best one, right?). According to the author, chips are the new gold, and will shape the global power alignment for the next couple decades. The book talks a ton about the history of semiconductors and the processes needed to create them, then and now, highlighting several key dependencies in the manufacturing and supply chain that I thought would represent potential targets for investment. I began researching the supply chain in greater detail in the hopes of making it easier for a non-technical guy like me to understand the holistic system from a systems theory approach. A Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) article had a few graphics that helped The article. First is the value chain showing the 3 steps to chip creation; design, fabrication, and Assembly, Test, and Packaging (ATP). Cool, now I just find out who does all of these things and invest, right? Not saying that wouldn’t work, but I’m kind of looking for an undervalued company with potential to grow (NVDA is out of my league at ~500/share, and probably overpriced). There are a lot of companies that compete in these spaces, some in one, many in multiple. Design: I focused on Design and Fabrication. There may be diamonds in the rough for ATP, but it was quite a bit broad in my initial research, and hard to narrow down/nothing stood out. Starting with Design, the CSIS article provided a good starting point with a list of several major players. The same article stated that “in the US and UK, Intel, ARM, and Cadence were core leaders in Intellectual property. For that reason, they were the three I chose to focus on. Fabrication: Fabrication plants (Fabs) are the most critical physical component in the manufacturing process, and there is a disproportionate dependency on TSMC fabs in Taiwan. There could be another post on the potential for China/Taiwan issues having a significant impact on the chip market, but for now, I will just highlight that the smallest chips in the world currently in mass production (3nm) are produced in TSMC and Samsung Fabs, making them key centers of gravity in the semi world. But fabs are simply another “system” in the larger system… What are they made of? The three key components for fabs are lithography machines, ultra-pure air, and ultra-pure water. So I began to look at what companies specialize in those areas… Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography (ASML) has a basic monopoly on Lithography machines, and recently sold its next generation lithography machines to Intel (more on that below). There are no shortage of Water and Air manufacturing companies. Again, focusing on US based companies, I arrived at Air Products ($APD), Hitachi ($HTHIY), and Xylem ($XYL). US based APD has been relatively stagnant, but HTHIY has been on a general uptrend for a couple years now. This maybe an option as I get more comfortable with investments with overseas companies, but for now I move on to water. XYL hasn’t shown a lot of movement, but they do offer a small dividend. Still, not enough potential for growth in my opinion. So, we have INTC with a ton of intellectual property and next generation Fab capabilities on the horizon.
