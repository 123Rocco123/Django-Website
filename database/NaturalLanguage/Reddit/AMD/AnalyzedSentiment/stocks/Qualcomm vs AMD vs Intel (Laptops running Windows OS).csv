Everyone is hyping up ARM as if it's new tech. It isn't. Microsoft has already tried the ARM in windows thing, and consumers didn't like that 70% of applications simply refused to run on it. Want to run this steam game from 2013? Good luck. Need to install a niece program for a work or class assignment? Unless the person running that has a new release that supports ARM, you're out of luck. Simply put, there have been a ton of ""x86"" killers released for decades, and none of them succeed, because when so much of modern computing is built on x86, it doesn't make a lot of sense to shift away from it. The only reason why Apple and Qualcomm are even using ARM is because it is open for use, while x86 and x86-64 aren't. There is literally no reason why you should use an ARM chip over an x86 in a laptop or desktop.It should also be noted that ARM is not just one architecture, it's a dozen, all requiring different programs and tooling. x86 is also not fundamentally more power sucking, as tuning the clock down(servers and laptops do this already) can significantly reduce the power draw. The only reason ARM succeeded in mobile is because Intel fumbled, Qualcomm and Co. succeeded, and the feedback loop that followed meant there was basically no entry room for x86.",0,0.523,1.0,NEGATIVE

First, servers are the most likely to get ARM'd, because most software there can be shifted to ARM, as AWS can easily make their software engineers develop something for ARM. That's the market share that Nvidia sees the most potential in. As for Qualcomm and their recent developments, this is kinda not true. To get the high performance advertised, the chips need to hit a near 80TDP, and we haven't had thorough testing from 3rd parties to confirm or deny. The point about Intel and AMD is pretty much nothing. These chips from QC are coming out a whole year and a half after any AMD or Intel chips(Yes, I know about the refresh, but that isn't an architecture change, so it doesn't really count), it'd be like comparing a 14900k to a Ryzen 3rd gen. The difference in time between the release of these chips is a big reason why Intel and AMD are behind.Microsoft has literally developed software support for any chip and any architecture with any traction. You can find windows for PowerPC, DEC Alpha, SPARC, and plenty of others. They don't care who's chips run on their devices, what they care about is ensuring that another developer doesn't take their market share. Putting any layer of abstraction(Ie emulating x86 to ARM) creates performance overhead that any serious developer won't risk. Apple was able to create something unique with their M chips because it's a full SOC and they control the entire ecosystem of development and deployment. QC and Windows will never have this advantage.",2,0.54,0.999,NEGATIVE

For a mobile device you care about power.Developers are okay with the emulation layer, as long as it works and proof of that is Apple'a Rosetta, it has been there for years now, nothing new.The overhead of the emulation layer is not even 5% for gaming, as most of the bottle neck in games is the GPU, as long as the CPU don't starve the GPU the emulation overhead is not significant.",3,0.535,1.0,NEGATIVE

Comparing two leading chips from x86 and ARM(M3 Max and 14900HX) the two have similar TDPs and consume very similar amounts of power. These chips trade blows across the board, and for anything requiring large amounts of RAM or cache, you're gonna need an Intel chip. AMD 7945HX also has similar performance and TDP numbers. This isn't even mentioning the fact that the Apple OS has been ultra optimized for these very specific chips, or even the fact that Intel and AMD chips are running on architecture that is more than a year older than the M3 chips.The emulation layer is much more than 5%. Not only is the emulation layer much higher in overhead(closer to 15-20%) but ARM chips do not take advantage of the same RAM speeds and bandwidth as x86, which hurts a lot in RAM intensive programs. The only reason why you wouldn't see high performance losses in gaming is because most games aren't CPU bound. However, if you're an engineering student, or someone that runs PyTorch natively, or someone who needs something that can process a high load will not like something that cannot run at the same speeds as native.Developers don't care whether their program is emulated or run natively, just that it works. The problem is that you're comparing Rosetta to other emulation software, while conveniently forgetting that Apple controls EVERYTHING within that system. Apple can control everything down to a tea, meaning they know exactly what will run best on the M chips. Microsoft, on the other hand, would need to build emulation software for each different skew of ARM.",4,0.529,0.999,NEGATIVE

They all show a 20-50% overhead for emulation. That is not even close to ""minimal"", that's 1-2 generational difference type of overhead.The thermal argument is just dumb because x86 chips only hit higher thermals and power load when they turbo up to 4ghz+. You're also comparing chips designed on older manufacturing processes and nodes to newer ones, when that makes a very big difference in thermals and TDP. The TDP for chips that are manufactured around the same time (M2 ultra and 7945hx) you get very a performance beat for AMD, with a slight power efficiency beat for the M2. These chips aren't fundamentally more power consuming, as most x86 chips are just designed to run as fast as possible with the given power and cooling, but if you don't give it that power(taking it on the go, for example) you end up with a computer that will run at a very similar TDP.",2,0.52,0.993,NEGATIVE

I mean, Microsoft has said Rosetta is the benchmark, and if the benchmark is 20-50% behind native, that's not good at all for ARM. You also have to account for the fact that emulation is a power sucking process, as adding any abstraction layers will cause overhead for the CPU. This is especially present with programs made in cpp, as they are mostly designed to be extremely fast, but by adding any layer of abstraction you're effectively making the language higher level, and forcing the machine to work harder to process both types.It's incredibly hard to truly measure TDP and power draw, as every OEM will have different MOBOs that allocated different amounts of power and completely different cooling. I can tell you that, in no uncertain terms, that Intel doesn't care. Windows and Apple have long been trying to make the switch over to ARM in some regard, and it is likely that Apple, with its full control over the ecosystem, will be fairly successful in this endeavor, but Microsoft is significantly less likely to end up with those same benefits. If Intel and AMD went running every time a new ""x86 killer"" was announced, the building would be in chaos. These companies have bigger worries than ARM. ARM is just another chip for them. Another competitor. They don't care if it's running x86 or ARM or PowerPC, what they care about is market share, and right now ARM doesn't have it. Intel is coming out with their 15th gen later this year, which will be on a whole new process node, and that will give them considerable power and thermal improvements.",4,0.538,1.0,NEGATIVE

Second, ARM is not fundamentally better. ARM emphasizes RISC, which makes compilers have to work significantly harder to convert code into pieces that a device can actually work with. Meanwhile, x86 with its CISC architecture can leverage stronger microcode, which allows x86 to simply run faster. CISC is also designed to be more diverse in terms of its instruction set, and since desktops, laptops, and servers are fundamentally designed for more diverse and complex tasks. Anything that is needing extremely complex math(I.e. research, code compilation, higher end media formats and encoding, running literally any engineering task, ect) just won't run as well on ARM. Now, ARM has done a great job in smaller devices, namely wearables, embedded, and mobile. This is because the chips are open for license and the RISC limitations tend not to be an issue because 1-2 companies control the entire development ecosystem. If you want to develop for an Apple watch or an iPhone, you need to use Swift(or obj-c, but, like, yuck). Pretty much anything that runs on these devices goes through a very specific process to be developed. PCs don't have this advantage. You're gonna be developing for a very wide range of hardware, and there's about 500 different languages someone can choose to develop with, and tons of different things that can ONLY run on a desktop. ARM cannot account for these use cases. Also, how do developers account for the different types of ARM chips out there? ARM chips get designed by ARM, by OEMs, by all sorts of players. Hell, if you had the money and time, you could theoretically develop an ARM chip. This creates massive differences in what exactly can run on an ARM chip, while x86 and x86-64 are pretty much universal. Intel has no control over the ecosystem, which is a point you completely overlook. Windows only develops the OS, and they have versions of Windows for things like PowerPC and DEC Alpha. They'll continue to throw devs at anything that can make them money.x86 chips do consume more power, because they are faster, but that doesn't mean they must fundamentally be more consuming. Comparing two leading chips from x86 and ARM(M3 Max and 14900HX) the two have similar TDPs and consume very similar amounts of power. These chips trade blows across the board, and for anything requiring large amounts of RAM or cache, you're gonna need an Intel chip. AMD 7945HX also has similar performance and TDP numbers. This isn't even mentioning the fact that the Apple OS has been ultra optimized for these very specific chips, or even the fact that Intel and AMD chips are running on architecture that is more than a year older than the M3 chips.x86 beat ARM in the desktop and laptop market because it was designed very specifically for this market. ARM is not. There was no ""first to the market"" advantage. While x86 did have first to the market, ARM came out with its first chip just a few years after x86, and at this point there was basically no commercially recognized standard. ARM chose to focus on smaller embedded devices, and once more developers started developing for x86, it was clear that x86 would beat ARM. However, there have been multiple players that tried to unseat x86. PowerPC is probably the most notable, with IBM and Apple both going all in on this ISA. This too was a RISC chip, with diverse software and hardware support from multiple large companies. It failed because x86 was fundamentally better. There's a reason AMD chose to back design the x86 to x86-64, and it's because it was a better choice for the company. And look now, AMD and Intel are basically the only real players in the CPU space.The point about Apple and the M chips is basically mute. First, the company has been using the most advanced development techniques through TSMC 3nm, and they've been releasing chips way more than Intel and AMD, which both haven't released full generations since 2022, and in chipmaking world, that's a really long time. Apple also controls the software, which means they can do a lot more software optimization and tricks to make applications work better within their ecosystem. Apple created Swift, and they control the compiler. It's also worth noting that Apple's M series is an SOC, which holds a big advantage in terms of dye travel times and speed. The distance between your RAM and CPU can be a serious performance overhead if you're doing something serious. Packaging all these parts together, combined with them adding multiple smaller specialized chips makes the SOC much faster, while AMD and Intel can't currently offer an SOC, but I'm sure that'll change soon enough.",2,0.538,0.996,NEGATIVE

Not as well as a discrete GPU but about as well as a console.I think the main selling point for Snapdragon is that it has a long battery life and low power draw. It needs to be priced effectively to basically sell people the lowest tier of laptops. Otherwise it doesn't have functionality to compete with x86 competition and it is just a worse version of the MacBook.,6,0.535,1.0,NEGATIVE
