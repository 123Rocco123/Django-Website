,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",lol how does one have so much money without knowing anything about it,0,0.518,0.994,POSITIVE

Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days.

IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","Its a troll, op is full of shit",2,0.502,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank.

This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",ZS has 5x it's revenue and the stock has 10x in 5 years. That's definitely what I consider trash.,4,0.563,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days.

,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","My grandfather used to manage my stock account, and when he got too old to keep up, then I started trying to do it on my own.

The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","50 times of your salary in stock, that is very impressive! How did you allocate the fund in the account to achieve this? Prior to investing in stock market, I did very well in real estate investment. 3/4 of my net worth today is in real estate equity. The rental net income I have is good enough for me to retire actually as it’s already more than my job income.I was very depressed about my bad timing on when I started stock investing and couldn’t be more happier when I broke even. But right now all the holdings I have are the companies that I spend time studying and researching so I wonder if it were you, which companies will you drop (I updated details on my post on each of the companies I hold) or how will you reallocate the fund I have in the stock? I want to spend more time from now on to think about my investment allocation rather than having all in stocks.",2,0.566,0.991,POSITIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s.

Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",Thank you for your kind response.

,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price.

In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1).

And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",I’ve seen people park 27 million in a bank account with 250k fdic insurance if someone is Rich it’s because they either inherited or got really good at one thing.

,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","The Jed Clampett syndrome, I call it…",2,0.503,0.888,NEGATIVE

The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",You put 1.5 million mostly into ZIRP trash?

,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s.

Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1).

Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s.

It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","I am gonna call Schwab and ask them to suspend their account. They shouldn't be buying stocks. If the OP just bought 80% SPY and 20% cash and equivalent, they would have made around 30% buy now, which they could have then put in high yield fixed income like Treasury Bills, and get around $70,000 of income doing nothing while waiting for the economy to cool.Prime example of why people should seek advice. Buying stocks doesn't make you smarter, but in the contrary, it will make you look like a moron.FFS, the OP went to buy companies that are not really generating tons of cash flow when inflation was sky-high",1,0.525,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low.

In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green.

Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","For a starter, no its not, and if you think investing is for decades, then you are not as smart as you think you are.“An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return.”That is literally what investing is all about. Investing has no timeline, especially when you close to retiring age. Build and maintain. The only set it and forget is the market as a whole. Otherwise, you must actively manageSecond of all, that is one of the dumbest things I have ever heard in my life about investing. You really think interest rate and risk free assets have no correlation to investing decisions? Its not like you can buy AAA bonds for 30 years that are yielding 4.5-5.5% today.Yes, no shit. Interest rates are not going to be 5% for ever. It may be 5.5%, maybe 6%, maybe 3%, or maybe 2%, no one knows, and yet, your estimated return should be over the interest rate yield, especially LTT if you buy stocks, 101 math.Buying a stock that yields 5% when treasuries are yielding 5% is stupid. US businesses will not yield more than 6.5% annually over the next 2 decades, and more or less, this number is close to 5.5% than 7% since you are long term bullshit bullshit, and ignoring the impact of interest rates on making investing decisions is ludicrous.",3,0.527,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far.

Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","Posts like these make me feel good.

,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day.

Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily.

It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","I mean 40% of the portfolio in questionable plays like Upstart, Zofi and Zscaler?We'll likely be seeing another sob story thread in 2024 or 2025 about how they lost a million bucks.",2,0.53,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location.

After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","No they did not, If they bought SPY on September 21st they’d also be around even.

,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far.

ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s.

This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",Can I ask how old you are?,0,0.508,0.531,NEGATIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy.

Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","And yet, he is doing better than 90% of r/stocks",2,0.545,0.98,POSITIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market.

Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday?

Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",So the first thing you did when you started investing was dump $1mm+ in?

,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",If you're actually investing long term (10+ years) then there's no reason not to do that.,1,0.549,0.969,POSITIVE

When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",This works if you buy the index. That's what reconstitutes itself with winners over time and comes back. UPST? Who knows,2,0.532,0.892,NEGATIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s.

Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","yea, that is what gets me the most lol.",1,0.495,0.998,POSITIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data.

In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1).

Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",But it's not like they did that in a vacuum.

,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",Well duh.

Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","First mistake was paying money to a ""stock pick service""",0,0.6,0.999,NEGATIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.

This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","Worse, it was Motley Fool!",2,0.498,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover.

,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far.

They also are small minded and don’t realize that over 10-20 years you only need a few of those companies to do really well to make a lot of money.Also they seemed to ignore you invested right before a decent sized crash especially for start up type tech companies.

I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",You actually held lol.

,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post.

The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",I updated my post on why I have big UPST position,1,0.533,0.981,NEGATIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price.

Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1).

And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","This is one of the rare scenarios where DCA actually works.However, you should never have used or paid for this ""stock pick service"".

,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.

The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",😂,1,0.5,0.761,NEGATIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense.

I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",Do you mean the rest companies are not good companies in your opinion?

,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data.

In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday?

And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","To have everyone see it, I updated my post to answer your question",1,0.507,0.855,POSITIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","I also subscribed to Motley Fool in 2021.

With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","Sell this shit immediately, break even, and put it in a few index funds... when you have a 7 figure portfolio, it is best to invest reasonably to protect your wealth and grow it",0,0.518,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around.

I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders.

Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.

Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday?

Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","Congratulations to your +219% gain YTD. Except UPSI and a couple more I had one time owned almost all of yours. Exchanged for low volatility stuff.A closer study shows only NET:+51%, SOFI: +62.9% gain w/ a total of $59K led the show. The more popular Tsla, AMD, UNH barely moved from wrong time you acquired them.I have also looking at the rating of your winners. UPSI has a better opportunity than SOFI or NET. I just sold all my SOFI bought because of the sports stadium. I lost -$482. The Fin Tech price recent hike is only because of Supreme Court blocked Biden's student loan forgiveness program not because of any fundamentals changes to its bottom line. Soon it will be back to $6-7. I also dumped Loan Club, a struggling lender. As for Cloud stocks NET, it used to be my favorite stock. I sold them sometime ago moved to semi-conductors.What is going to be potential gain/loss for second half of the year it is really hard to say. I wish you the best.",0,0.549,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year.

I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s.

,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far.

I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",Dis brought back old CEO to cut cost to boost stock price. Do you think he won’t be able to achieve it? (I understand their financial situation not being good),1,0.551,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post.

The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",You're only breakeven after you sell.

,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low.

And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",Motley ‘Fool’,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","Some quality companies in there, you should be fine long term (10+ years).

Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1).

The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",I can also do inspect element on the browser,0,0.561,0.979,POSITIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense.

Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","""I paid for a stock pick service"".I call bullshit",0,0.607,0.999,NEGATIVE
,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data.

Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1).

Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","How are u up money on Upstart, Docusign, Crowdstrike, etc.. or we’re they only very small purchases of the overall invested money.Al do I what stock pick service are you using, was it Motley Fool?

,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market.

Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far.

The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI. Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank. IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE ZS, CRWD are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison: Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s) Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s) Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability. That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector. I own NET even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET IOT is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily. BILL is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated. GLBE is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium. Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS TMDX: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession. HIMS: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me. Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector. MELI A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company. DIS I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",The money was sitting in my checking account as I used it to invest in real estate.

,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly. I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation. I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120... Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000. I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day. On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD. I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate. I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day. Portfolio and 2-year&YTD charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk ===============================Update on 7/12/2023 ======================= 1) To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make. 2) To answer the question about why I hold these stocks: UPST Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens. Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy. Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%  SOFI I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s.

The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs OPEN I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data. Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN 3) To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover. I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss. Just to give a few examples: I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green. Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS. Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back. Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44. Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)   So in short, swing trade and rebalancing (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far. Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",Why?,1,0.5,0.979,NEGATIVE
