,"No positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers) To clarify since I've been asked: I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel: they're just my perspective of where a stock could potentially go. Percentages signify what the stock is trading at when I write up the report and are NOT predictions of stock price EOD. Some of the stocks I post are <$500M market cap and are NOT good long-term investments, but are good candidates to day trade. JBLU/SAVE, liquidity 9/10- SAVE rose to $7.70 today, likely due to JBLU saying they will appeal the decision. I personally am not a long-term holder in this, if JBLU really succeeds in appealing this is a process that will likely takes months. RVSN, liquidity, 8/10- Mainline System received certification for EU Railway Standards SEDG- liquidity, 7/10- Announces a restructuring plan with 15% workforce reduction NVDA, liquidity 8/10- Broke $600- but not cleanly. Still short the stock, but since the $600 broke so uncleanly I won’t be adding to my position. AMD/TSM/Semis/etc. – Moving opposite to NVDA- this could be the day they diverge, and NVDA could crack soon after (wild conjecture). Worth watching. Standing tickers TSLA, liquidity 7/10- Worth watching with Elon Musk fighting for 25% ownership of the company. RIOT/MARA/COIN/BITO/IBIT/HOOD/GBTC – Outflows are confirmed to get larger (possibly larger whales taking advantage of the additional liquidity. JNPR, liquidity 9/10 – HPE confirmed to buy JNPR at $40/cash, just leaving this on here for people to be aware, or if you want to play the merger arb. NS- to be acquired by Sunoco for $7B in stock. M- rejects $5.8B cash bid, saying it is not good enough (21/sh). Could see this go higher from a rival bidder",Tf is this and what do you mean by liquidity,0,0.5,0.907,POSITIVE

I'm an ex-prop trader and I like to make these watchlists for fun.I answer the liquidity question here:I'd say that there's a hierarchy to liquidity-10/10 - SPY, AAPL, QQQ, anything you can dump millions of dollars in and move the bid/ask a few cents (if at all)9/10 - Same as above, but usually lower priced and more prone to having a 2+ cent difference in bid/ask (which can be significant if you're dealing with a lower priced stock) (JNPR currently)8/10 - a normal company in the SP500 that has algos in it, can be a high priced or low priced stock but can be subject to slippage. (NVDA)7/10- Companies that have algos but never have that bid-ask spread as tight as needed, almost always have some form of slippage (TSLA being a notable example).6/10- Pretty much a case by case basis, but I tend not to put stocks like that on the watchlist. Not that liquid and wide bid/ask spread.",1,0.529,0.938,NEGATIVE

It is up over 1,386% this month as of today. That’s crazy! I’d never even heard of it until a week ago. I came searching to see if anyone was talking about it and your post is the only mention of that ticker I’ve found. I’m still not entirely sure what the company is.",0,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE
