,"I really don't like the ""Magnificent 7"" name at all, but since everyone has adopted it, let's just roll with it. For those who don't know the Magnificent 7 are: AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, META, TSLA, NVDA. With a combined market cap of more than $11 trillion, they currently make up approx. 29% of the S&P 500's market cap. The 7 giants have gained 71% so far this year while the rest of the 493 stocks included in the benchmark index have gained 6%. They have also outperformed all other stocks in terms of growth, profit margins and forward EPS growth, and have stronger balance sheets. Most analysts expect that the M7 will continue to outperform all other companies until 2025 at least. Now I know this is a ""stocks"" subreddit but just like the majority of retail investors, a large chunk of my portfolio is alocated to an S&P 500 ETF. So I am actually considering instead of DCAing into a broad index ETF, why don't I just DCA into those 7? Maybe even swap META & TSLA since I am not rly a big fan of, with other 2-3 large caps that I favor, like AMD, and ADBE. Should we expect these 7 to continue outperforming the rest of the world? Should we consider cyclicality? There's no doubt that all 7 of these companies are leaders and are probably not going anywhere in the near future. Nowdays it's as difficult as ever to overtake these giants, imo.",If you bought a m7 of the 1990s you’d own some mediocre oil and pharma stocks,0,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE
