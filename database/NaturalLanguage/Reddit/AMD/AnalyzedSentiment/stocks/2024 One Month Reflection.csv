,"Coming into 2024 there were hopes of six rate cuts. Institutions started positioning themselves into small caps in November and December thinking the rate cuts will drive small caps. Tech had such a great year last year, but most of the gains were from losses in 2022. Based on chairman Powell's remarks yesterday it is unlikely we see a rate cut in march. That is when we started to see another selloff. Besides the rate cuts probably not happening until May their is also risk in the regional banking sector when they start realizing the losses in commercial real estate. There is also instability in the Middle East which is affecting shipping. Oil prices have not gone up yet due to this conflict. As long as the conflict is contained and does not start to grow I don't see this being a big issue. Tech earnings started to come in and it has been a mixed bag so far. SMCI is showing great strength from the AI boom. AMD's Lisa SU said,“We are in the very early stages of the AI computing era, and the rate of adoption and growth is faster than any other technology in recent history” Microsoft reported 30% growth in Azure revenue. Based on this information the broader market should start to do better around April leading into the May Fed meeting. There is risk if we don't see the rate cuts in May which are not guaranteed. I would stay out of the regional banks even if their are cuts due to the commercial real estate risk. Hopefully this will not bleed over to ther areas of the economy. Lastly I think tech will continue to outperform for at least a few years due to the early AI cycle. This is going to lead to PC sales, data center, and cellular phone sales, to name a few that will see growth due to everyone upgrading for the AI technology. Growth in the income will start to then reflect in the stocks. What are your observations and how are you setting yourself up?","I see 2024 being a great year overall for stocks/ overall economy . Maybe even better than 2023 . Things will slow down a lot in 2025 /2026 , that's when the recession will hit , it will be mild a  recession likely lasting the average length of a recession .

The biggest permabull, tom lee, also expect roughly 10% correction starting this month.It's not a wild take. It's actually a very normal take, if not a bullish one, considering the median sp500 target for the end of year 2024 is roughly 4800. Tom Lee with the highest target sees it only at 5200 in 11 months. Those targets bake in earnings that would be roughly 10% higher than todayA wild take is actually the US entering a recession some time in the next few months, which according to cam Harvey, the guy who discovered the yield curve inversion, would still fall within historical norms of historical lag time of recession. If this does happen, sp500 would likely revisit 3500",2,0.536,1.0,NEGATIVE

I was in financials before the run-up, sold out of MS at $92/share while calling a financial & small cap (much of which is regional banking) roll off at earnings + rotation back into the comfort of big tech due to the run up being wildly premature since earnings benefit of rate hikes isn’t going to be felt for some time. After the roll off, I bought back into MS since the wealth management business constituting 55%-ish of their revenue will benefit from AUM increase by way of big tech pulling the index up. That benefit will come in later quarters, so I’m positioned with covered calls. I also picked up PLTR on a buy-write with just over 7% premium from selling 2/23 17 strike covered calls (earnings are 2/5). Everything else is index based, including a fair bit of SSO.My expectation is that there will be a lot of internal chop as institutions try to find earnings growth, without much sticky growth coming until the second half.",0,0.541,0.999,NEGATIVE
