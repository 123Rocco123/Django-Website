INTC, which is what I assume you mean by INTL, is up 30% lately, while CVX is down 30% lately.If they revert to mean, that's a heck of a pairs trade.Counterpoint though is that buying something on the decline is ill-advised when you don't know where the bottom is. Chevron could certainly continue to fall on production and demand issues and weather issues, and other issues.Intel might have another breakout related to ongoing chips act and foundry optimism.That said I too have sold Intel and added to Chevron. However I'm not that strongly convicted on either of those positions.",0,0.533,1.0,NEGATIVE
