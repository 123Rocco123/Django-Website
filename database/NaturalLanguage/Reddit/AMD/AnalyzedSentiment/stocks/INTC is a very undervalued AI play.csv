AMD is cheaper, and far cheaper still are ASICs, ARM-based processors, and so much of the ML community relies on cuda through NVIDIA GPUs.On the manufacturing side, intel fabs are several lithography generations behind TSMC. Intel itself uses TSMC for the latest generation processors because their fabs are behind. Investing in new fab tech is always a multi-year gamble ahead and we haven‚Äôt seen the customer base or the steep investment in new cutting edge fab techniques.What intel has going for it is xenophobic gov buyers who want American vertical integration, even if it means semiconductors are less efficient or several generations behind the state of the art.",0,0.545,0.999,NEGATIVE
