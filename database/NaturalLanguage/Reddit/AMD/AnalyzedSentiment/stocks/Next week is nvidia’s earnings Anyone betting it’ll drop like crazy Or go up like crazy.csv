It makes no money on its own. It solely goes up and down based on people’s sentiments about it. It makes zero sense to me, yet it still gets hype every so often.NVDA is a powerhouse with different segments of profitability. AI is what crypto was a couple years ago. The difference being that any tech hype will involve NVDA until the day it doesn’t. That will be a long time from now. So, to me, as long as tech keeps evolving, and the makers keep their money in tech, NVDA will continue to pull in larger pieces of the pie than other companies.One day they will get knocked off by an infant company of today, but until then NVDA will stay the king for a long time the way AAPL did/is (their fall may be on the horizon).

Using a 40 multiple, the share price would be $1,040.Or you can dial back the multiple to 30, and you could justify a price of $780.But huge growth comes with higher multiples.
