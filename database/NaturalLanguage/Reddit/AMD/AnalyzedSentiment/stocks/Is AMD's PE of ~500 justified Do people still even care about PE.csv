Both are probably overpriced though, but who knows if there is more room to grow and the actual future demand is still unknown.",0,0.579,1.0,NEGATIVE

For example, Model Y makes extensive use of large ""megacastings"", which eliminates a lot of robots. Everything from electrical systems to seating are continuously under optimization. The result is that Tesla can drive down costs far faster than anyone else.Tesla is also operationally very efficient. If you look at their OpEx in the quarterly reports, they've been very disciplined at holding expenses steady even as the business grows.Finally, Tesla has a growing energy business. They have a factory in Lathrop, California, specifically dedicated to Megapack production. Utilities worldwide are using these systems to gradually replace gas-fired peaker plants. Tesla is also working on another Megapack factory in China.Bots, AI services, and AI software are a potential source of future revenue.

Or do people not care about PE anymore and just believe that AMD will continue grow its revenue amidst the AI tsunami?","This puzzles me as well..AMD's PE (TTM) is now at 1,403, while NVDA is at 78??Hope anyone here can explain..",2,0.568,0.704,NEGATIVE
,"AMD has been on a crazy hot streak the last few years, outperforming the market by many multiples, outperforming its peers (INTL, NVDA) and outperforming just about every other stock except for a few giants. This stock is super frothy at this point, right? Granted that it still makes good products, but I don't know how the ~500 PE can be justified when NVDA is ~220 and INTL is ~negative. Or do people not care about PE anymore and just believe that AMD will continue grow its revenue amidst the AI tsunami?",Do you understand PER? negative PER is worse than any positive one.,0,0.554,1.0,NEGATIVE
