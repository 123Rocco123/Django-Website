Will this help the struggling Intel stock?","Intel has finally caught up with AMD and Nvidia in terms of raw performancethey didnt catch up with AMD. let alone Nvidia, in terms of raw performance.you're not understanding what raw performance means.ignoring several things, the Arc b580 caught up on the budget performance GPU market. not to mention, only compared to their (AMD/nvidias) old GPU lines",0,0.563,NEGATIVE,1.0

,"Intel has launched Arc B580 GPU which has received pretty positive reviews. It means, being a late player, Intel has finally caught up with AMD and Nvidia in terms of raw performance.

,"Intel has launched Arc B580 GPU which has received pretty positive reviews. It means, being a late player, Intel has finally caught up with AMD and Nvidia in terms of raw performance. Will this help the struggling Intel stock?",Battlemage by itself probably can't make a big enough impact. But my question is more around the fact that they have caught up with the competition to the point that they are able undercut the competition at the price bracket. That means they have potential to take a bigger market share and potentially enter more GPU market segments (AI/server?).,1,0.546,NEGATIVE,0.982
,"Intel has launched Arc B580 GPU which has received pretty positive reviews. It means, being a late player, Intel has finally caught up with AMD and Nvidia in terms of raw performance.

It's not guarantee salvation for Intel but it does show they can be competitive in prince/performance/features...at least on the gpu side.

Will this help the struggling Intel stock?","I wouldn't call it caught up when AMD and Nvidia probably have the ability to make even better gpus than battlemage at that price, but have never had a reason to. Now they will. Once they do that, you'd have to be silly to buy an intel knowing how immature their driver support is.",2,0.552,NEGATIVE,0.761

,"Intel has launched Arc B580 GPU which has received pretty positive reviews. It means, being a late player, Intel has finally caught up with AMD and Nvidia in terms of raw performance. Will this help the struggling Intel stock?","I actually think battlemage is a way bigger win than some people seem to believe.Intel's XeSS 2.0 with frame generation is actually bonkers. There is currently only 1 title with it, but it works really really well. AMD gets crushed by it. It initially seems like it might be better than DLSS 3.0 as well, but we need to see more titles that support it.The B580 is also selling out, a lot of people are trying to get one now. Ideally, this suggests that market share is increasing for ARC graphics, which is more important than profits right now. I honestly think now is a great time to buy Intel stock. It's very close to the 52 week low, and the news has been pretty positive. People have good reason to shit on Intel stock, but after seeing the recent reviews and benchmarks for the B580 in games, I'm very hopeful.I'm in for 300 shares and 40 options, with a price target of $25-30 by end of January.",0,0.555,POSITIVE,0.985

I don't think I know enough about his individual contributions and impact to have a valid opinion on the board's decision. Initially, it sounded like people thought the board made an aggressive but correct call. Recently though, in the past couple of weeks, I've been hearing more of the opposite sentiment.Interested in why you think it was such a bad call, since you are presumably more informed on the subject?",2,0.508,NEGATIVE,1.0
