,"I was digging deep into a lot of tech stocks on my watch lists and came across what I think are two big differences that separate AMD and NVDA from a margins perspective and a management approach. Obviously, at the moment NVDA has superior technology and the current story for AMD's expected rise (an inevitable rise in the eyes of most) is that they'll steal future market share from NVDA. That they'll close the gap and capture billions of dollars worth of market share. Well, that might eventually happen, but I couldn't ignore these two differences during my research. The first is margins. NVDA is rocking an astounding 42% profit margin and 57% operating margin. AMD on the other hand is looking at an abysmal .9% profit margin and 4% operating margins. Furthermore, when it comes to management, NVDA is sitting at 27% of a return on assets and 69% return on equity while AMD posts .08% return on assets and .08% return in equity. Thats an insane gap in my eyes. Speaking to management there was another insane difference. AMD's president rakes home 6 million a year while the next highest paid person is making just 2 million. NVDA's CEO is making 1.6 million and the second highest paid employee makes 990k. That to me looks like greedy president on the AMD side versus a company that values it's second tier employees in NVDA. I've been riding the NVDA wave for nearly a decade now and have been looking at opening a defensive position in AMD, but those margins and the CEO salary disparity I found to be alarming at the moment. Maybe if they can increase their margins it'll be a buy for me, but waiting for a pull back until then and possibly a more company friendly President.","Pretty stupid when NVDA ceo is paid mostly in stock options which is worth hundreds of millions.EDIT: ok looked it, his salary is 95% from bonuses and stock options. So the argument that he is only paid $1.6 million a year is wrong, that’s just his base salary.",0,0.586,1.0,NEGATIVE

Is it dragging the company down? Yes. But excluding it is the very definition of cherry picking, which you're accusing him of.The entire reason why the industry and regulators adopted GAAP is because without it, a company can report any way they wish, so it gives the appearance of the business being stronger than it actually is. The only reason why you lean on non GAAP is if the GAAP earnings looks bad. Thats it.

It is in the process of being acquired by AMD, a deal that is expected to close by the end of 2021. As part of the acquisition, Xilinx has to amortize some of its intangible assets, such as patents and customer relationships, over a certain period of time. This means that Xilinx has to reduce the value of these assets on its balance sheet and recognize the expense on its income statement.According to its latest quarterly report, Xilinx recorded an amortization expense of $29 million in the fiscal second quarter of 2022, which ended on October 2, 2021. This was a decrease of $2 million from the previous quarter. Xilinx did not disclose the total amount of intangible assets subject to amortization or the remaining amortization period in its report. However, based on its previous annual report, Xilinx had $1.17 billion of intangible assets as of March 27, 2021, and the weighted-average amortization period was 9.5 years.Assuming that the amortization expense is constant over time and that there are no impairments or additions to the intangible assets, it would take Xilinx about 40 quarters or 10 years to complete the amortization of its intangible assets. However, this is a rough estimate and may not reflect the actual amortization schedule or the impact of the acquisition by AMD.""",2,0.553,0.999,NEGATIVE

Currently Nvidia has many more years of software development and support for their Hardware. However since AMD has open source software I'm betting that there will be more adoption if their Hardware is good and cheaper than NVIDIA. The biggest limiting factor going forward is the power a chip can consume. Thermals become an issue as well as generally just powering the chips. Alot of the performance of a chip for a given size of silicon comes down to the density of the logic and SRAM transistors. Smaller transistors allow for greater efficiencies since they require less voltage to operate when compared to larger ones and they also allow for less parasitic when switching. Remember that capacitance is directly correlated to area, so a smaller capacitor has less capacitance. Capacitance limits the switching frequency of the IC and is a partial reason for the energy usage of an IC. This is why intel isn’t competitive in terms of power when compared to AMD cpus. In gamers nexus’s review the 14900k draws about twice the power as the 7950x while providing a similar performance. Intel’s 10nm node is showing its age and so they physically cannot improve their designs without either shrinking the node or increasing the die size. Currently the The 14900k has a die size of 257 mm² and a zen 4 ccd has a die size of 70mm2. While not directly a fair comparison (since im ignoring the io die) AMD is able to provide the same performance as the intel cpu while using half the power and almost half the die area due to the process node advantage. Why does this matter? Transistor scaling is slowing down significantly since we are reaching the limits of nature. If we look at the process node densities for nvidas gpus we can see that ampere had 44.56 million transistors per mm2 on Samsung 8, and 143.7 million transistors per mm2 on tsmc 4. However tsmc 3 only has a density of 173.1 million transistors per mm2. Furthermore SRAM, which is a significant portion of logic circuits on a CPU/GPU, is slowing down significantly. Tsmcs n3 node only provides 5% downwards scaling on SRAM when compared to TSMC 5. As transistors slowdown in scaling downwards new packaging technology is required for Moore's law to continue. AMD is the only company who has years of experience designing chips around these packaging technologies and what they have created is incredible for how modular everything is. Smaller dies allow for better yields, they allow for them to use cheaper older nodes for the SRAM cells as seen in the x3d products. This is why hardware wise AMD currently is superior to NVIDIA. The physical limitations of size are happening and with that we will see more and more companies adopt the chiplet strategy out of necessity.",2,0.538,0.995,NEGATIVE

Obviously, at the moment NVDA has superior technology and the current story for AMD's expected rise (an inevitable rise in the eyes of most) is that they'll steal future market share from NVDA. That they'll close the gap and capture billions of dollars worth of market share. Well, that might eventually happen, but I couldn't ignore these two differences during my research. The first is margins. NVDA is rocking an astounding 42% profit margin and 57% operating margin. AMD on the other hand is looking at an abysmal .9% profit margin and 4% operating margins. Furthermore, when it comes to management, NVDA is sitting at 27% of a return on assets and 69% return on equity while AMD posts .08% return on assets and .08% return in equity. Thats an insane gap in my eyes. Speaking to management there was another insane difference. AMD's president rakes home 6 million a year while the next highest paid person is making just 2 million. NVDA's CEO is making 1.6 million and the second highest paid employee makes 990k. That to me looks like greedy president on the AMD side versus a company that values it's second tier employees in NVDA. I've been riding the NVDA wave for nearly a decade now and have been looking at opening a defensive position in AMD, but those margins and the CEO salary disparity I found to be alarming at the moment. Maybe if they can increase their margins it'll be a buy for me, but waiting for a pull back until then and possibly a more company friendly President.",Bet on a jockey!! Lisa is smart she will not scare nvda that they are a threat but slowly shift the ground like they did with Intel!! My two cents!,0,0.513,0.997,NEGATIVE
