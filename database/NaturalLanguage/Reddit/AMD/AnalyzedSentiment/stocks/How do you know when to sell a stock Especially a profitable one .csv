For example, sell after a 20% gain, or sell when it reaches a resistance level. Whatever. A plan of some kind. It could be sell as it reaches a percentage of your total portfolio too, so even if you want to hold for a long time, you can trim.You don't want to buy a stock without a plan.

You don't realistically know if AMD is heading for 50 or 200. Your best strategy is to just keep a decent risk allocation and not let any single position become outsized in your portfolio. Basically trim shares to keep the percentage similar in relation to your other assets and roll the money into an index.

Here's an excerpt:""I believe there are three reasons, and three reasons only, for the sale of any common stock which has been originally selected according to the investment principles already discussed. The first of these reasons should be obvious to anyone. This is when a mistake has been made in the original purchase and it becomes increasingly clear that the factual background of the particular company is, by a significant margin, less favorable than originally believed. The proper handling of this type of situation is largely a matter of emotional self-control. To some degree it also depends upon the investor’s ability to be honest with himself.""He has a great section on the psychology of selling a stock:""However, there is a complicating factor that makes the handling of investment mistakes more difficult. This is the ego in each of us. None of us likes to admit to himself that he has been wrong. If we have made a mistake in buying a stock but can sell the stock at a small profit, we have somehow lost any sense of having been foolish. On the other hand, if we sell at a small loss we are quite unhappy about the whole matter. This reaction, while completely natural and normal, is probably one of the most dangerous in which we can indulge ourselves in the entire investment process.""I know you were just asking about AMD in particular, but these principles have been really helpful for me.

Would you still invest in the company? If you would then keep holding, because all you’re doing if you sell is taking the profits and reinvesting it in another stock, if it’s still good enough to invest in then just cut out the extra set of reinvesting in the same stock and just keep holding.
