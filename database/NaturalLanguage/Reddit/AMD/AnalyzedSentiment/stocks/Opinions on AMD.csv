,"Hey guys. Wanted to get some more experienced people's opinions. I don't know if this kind of post is allowed or not. If not, I apologize and feel free to remove. So I'm a pc gamer and have noticed AMD has been popping off in all aspects. Almost nothing bad has been said about them this generation and I have heard and seen a lot of people moving from Intel and nvidia to AMD. I bought some calls on it since I believe it to continue to go up. These are my current options, it's not much, but I'm a beginner. And before anyone says it, I know people recommend to not do options early on and I understand why. I'm not afraid of losing the little bit of money I have in there. My goal is to get some decent chunks of change from AMD's calls and reinvest the profits into actual shares and using the original investment into calls again. Here are my options. The first 3 are cheap yolos that I know have a small chance. The second 2 are the ones I care about and really hoping does well. I feel like I made pretty decent choices. Opinions?","I have a sizable position in AMD, built up over the past few years, and I am very bullish on the company’s long term prospects. That having been said, you’re going to get absolutely wrecked on these options.",0,0.596,1.0,NEGATIVE

This means that compute will be offloaded to other types of semiconductor chips aside from CPUs. This implies a decelerating TAM for CPUs and an accelerating TAM for GPUs and ASICs. Intel’s business is heavily concentrated in CPU sales, and they are far far far behind NVIDIA and even AMD in GPU design.The fabrication business is not going to be easy for Intel to grow profits from. Fabrication is high capex, and again Intel is far behind TSMC and Samsung. Furthermore, the current valuation assumes they will make massive profits from the fab business in the future.

Opinions?",Analysts have a $121 price target on it. The PC market is starting to recover but it's not there yet. In 2023 AMD products have solidly outperformed Intel's but they are considered second rate compared to Nvidia. The gap between AMD and Intel is shrinking with the two product Intel launched in December. So a lot of the competition comes down to pricing. Because of that I don't see AMD earnings rocketing up. Even on the AI front I am guessing AMD will need to price their chips aggressively. Between that and having to pay TSMC their cut I don't think AMD will keep rocketing up.,0,0.584,0.998,NEGATIVE

Kodak for cameras. Intel for PC CPU’s. Digital Equipment for minicomputers. Wang for word processors. Sun for workstations. CP/M from Digital Research (first PC operating system). Many more. My point is these companies were close to monopolies in their time. The best by far. Way ahead of the bunch. Unbeatable or so many thought.

It's been very profitable for us all.As for your play, short dated options are essentially just gambling. If that's your thing, go for it.

Opinions?","Over the very long term these chip companies I suspect will have trouble.The calculus of the market is changing and quickly. Take Google. They just completed the training and now doing the inference with Gemini all on their own silicon. Without needing Nvidia or AMD.Google is now also doing their own chip in the Pixels.Not sure why it took Microsoft so long to get it. But now they are going to copy Google and try to do their own AI chips like the TPUs. A decade behind but they will eventually get there.This is the future. What changed is how big the providers have become. It is no longer a bunch of sales for the chip companies but more and more a concentration of sales.That creates a ROI for the companies to do their own chips. Key is how there is now TSMC, Samsung and Intel to do the fabrication of the chips.",0,0.56,0.834,NEGATIVE
