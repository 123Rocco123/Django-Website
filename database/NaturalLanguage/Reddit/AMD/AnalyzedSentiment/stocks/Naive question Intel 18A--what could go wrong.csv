Edit3: typos So, is buying Intel really a risk with its dirt-cheap pricing right now? Is it really ""dirt-cheap""?","It's not about the equipment but about the process. Every step needs to be extremely well controlled and understood. Each step has many variables that can be tuned, thousands of parameters to be set in the equipment and it all needs to be controlled with feedback loops to find and keep the sweet spot.TSMC has very advanced and successful analysis systems that have helped them really understanding how each critial step is doing and whether/ what they need to slightly tweak to adjust for fluctuations upstream.Samsung has had issues with not being able to find where the real issues are in the process, struggling to find a good sweet spot to begin with.Intel has had process issues, but also design issues where they went for an architecture that relied on some process steps to be really good...and they weren't and could not be fixed without open heart surgery. But still much more controlled and promising than Samsung, just not at the efficency and margins of TSMC.They can skip a generation because the learnings build upon each other, so you can just keep going beyond the point where you could've put a stick in the sand and say ""this process flow I will freeze and make a technology line"". Just keep going with development, and you'll end up at another of those opportunities, and you'd call that a next generation. There are some real revolutions in design, those a more binary jumps, like bspdn and gaa.The Downside is that you don't monetize, and don't learn any new insights from indistrializing the process.

Korean company with chaebol base like Samsung is very famous for their poor cultural issues. Like Korean drama, constant blame game and shifting responsibility instead of all hands of deck and resolving the issues. Thus, resulting in particularly slow and steady bleeding. While they have smart people, they may not able to utilise in effective and efficient manners.And to answer people that insist EUV is able to save the company, Samsung is one company that is very aggressive on implementing EUV in 1Z DRAM, where hynix only start putting in on 1alpha, and Micron only start putting in on 1gamma. And yet, samsung is the one behind in DRAM now.EUV is not the saviour, its a tool. It depends on who wields it. Either is a genius, or fool, only time will tell.",3,0.535,NEGATIVE,1.0
