,"Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Wednesday, September the 4th, 2024- Stock futures fall after worst S&P 500 day since early August rout: Live updates U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday after the major averages kick-started September lower, with the S&P 500 clocking its worst day since early August. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid 93 points, or 0.2%. Nvidia shares fell nearly 1% in the premarket after a Bloomberg report, citing sources familiar, said the U.S. Justice Department sent subpoenas to the chipmaker. The move comes after Nvidia tumbled more than 9% in Tuesday’s session amid a broader pullback in semiconductor stocks. Wall Street is coming off a losing session, with the major benchmarks posting their worst day going back to the Aug. 5th sell-off, as chip names came under pressure and the latest economic data implied slowing growth for the U.S. economy. The 30-stock Dow fell more than 600 points, or 1.5%, while the S&P 500 slid 2.1%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.3%. Traders are bracing for more volatility in September, historically a weak month for equities. Many investors anticipate a pullback of 5% or more in the coming weeks, although some money managers view any decline as a buying opportunity. “The next eight weeks should be a prime, a very prime opportunity, to rebalance your portfolio, get more diversified, and actually let the market activity go in your favor,” Chris Hyzy, investment chief at Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday. Corporate earnings season is largely behind investors, with Hewlett Packard Enterprise is set to post earnings after the close. Traders will also look to the latest releases on the U.S. trade deficit, job openings and labor turnover (JOLTS) survey, and factory orders data.
