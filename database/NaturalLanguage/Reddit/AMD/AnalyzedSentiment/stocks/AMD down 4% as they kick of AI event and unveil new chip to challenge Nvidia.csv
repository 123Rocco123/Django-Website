,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has kicked off its Advancing AI keynote, with Chief Executive Lisa Su taking the stage to preview the company’s latest innovations. This event proved a major catalyst for AMD’s stock last year, with shares rising 10% in the session following the event before going on a strong run through the end of the year. Investors may be hopeful that this year’s version will wind up a similar driver of stock momentum, especially since AMD shares have risen just 16% so far this year, ahead of the event, trailing the S&P 500. AMD is looking to get a bigger piece of the massive budgets being thrown toward artificial-intelligence hardware. Nvidia Corp. is by far the market leader, but analysts see room for multiple companies to win given the size of the opportunity. Su seemed to hint at that in her keynote presentation. “There’s no one company that has every answer,” she said, noting that AMD hopes to stand out in part through its embrace of open industry standards. Companies need “the right compute for the right applications,” she said, adding that AMD has “the best portfolio in the industry to address end-to-end AI,” in her view. Su opened by showing off the company’s new fifth-generation Epyc server central-processing unit for cloud, enterprise and AI use cases. The product, nicknamed Turin, offers up to four times more throughput performance. Amin Vahdat, the vice president for machine learning, systems and cloud AI at Google, came onstage to discuss the product and praise the performance per watt with AMD offerings.","Lots of bearish sentiment hereCan only mean a 30% run through the rest of the year.

The market suddenly likes semis again so I anticipate all of them will rally to close the year.I’d add the reason AMD has underperformed this year is flat revenues for 2 years now.
