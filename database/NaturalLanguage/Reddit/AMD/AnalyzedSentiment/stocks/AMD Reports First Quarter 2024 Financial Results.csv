I seen slowndown in gaming for example like never before. Low attention spans have taken over the entire thing. Nobody wants to invest themselves as much anymore when its all not as attractive as it used to be, anyone can get 10 sec dopamine hit with 10 sec investment these days.Even with economy, when people have for example 25% less money, its not going make them spend less 25% on leisure stuff, its going to make them cut leisure entirely and focus on something else.Third thing is stagnation, there has been a lot of criticisms from people that watched huge progression in everything from 1970 - 2010 and now just don't see it. AI in this case really takes over the entire spotlight.Sequentially, AMD expects Data Center segment revenue to be flat, with a seasonal decline in server sales offset by a strong Data Center GPU ramp. Client, Embedded and Gaming segment sales are expected to decline sequentially, with semi-custom revenue expected to decline by a significant double-digit percentage.AMD themselves predicted blood for 2024.I am not for now as optimistic, i think it has nothing to do with FED rates on top of that.",1,0.534,1.0,NEGATIVE

With that said, video games aren't even close to the biggest drivers for these companies. Professional work, corporations with desktops, individuals with laptops. Everyone needs a computer. And going forward, people will continue to buy new computers and upgrade current computers going forward. You're under the assumption that client computing all comes from gamers; it doesn't. There's a reason it's a market that averages around 70-80 billion in sales each year; because EVERYONE needs a computer. Currently, the slowdown comes from the fact that people aren't upgrading because of predictions of an economic slowdown, which are slowly proving to be untrue. Eventually, people will need to buy more computers. Also, Intel revenue, especially on the client computing side, has gone up, and they predict that client computing will drive revenue up before data centers do.As for why interest rates are affecting sales, they affect the data center sales. Many companies that previously chose to borrow to upgrade servers are choosing to stick with their current servers instead of upgrading, as they don't want to borrow money at 5-8% to upgrade their server setups. This will subside, as eventually companies will need to upgrade current servers. Most run on a timetable, which got majorly pushed up during covid. This means a lot of companies upgraded during the pandemic, but are now more cautions about upgrading. Thing is, the longest you can really support a server is 5 years, and we're coming right up to that mark, meaning companies are gonna need to bite the bullet.The Ai sales are temporary.
