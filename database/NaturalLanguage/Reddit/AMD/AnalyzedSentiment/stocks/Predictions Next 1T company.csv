This allows decision makers to make better decisions and spot potential problems ahead of time (like where production bottlenecks might occur).You can see demo videos on YouTube from actual customers (search for Palantir FoundryCon and AIPCon). Notable examples are Panasonic using Foundry to make battery cell manufacturing more efficient at the Tesla Gigafactory in Nevada, and Tyson Foods using Foundry to save 200 million/year in operational costs. Cleveland Clinic also uses Foundry, and the software is gaining traction in health care generally because it was designed with strong privacy and auditing controls.The products are real and generate significant value for clients.Palantir has the potential to be everywhere in business and government.I don't think PLTR will reach 1 Trillion market cap anytime soon, but I think it will grow steadily over the next decade.4% of my portfolio is in PLTR.",2,0.538,1.0,POSITIVE

AMD is doing well in both consumer and enterprise tech but not enough to skyrocket their stock price. Intel is an interesting option, they're trimming a ton of fat and pushing hard into their foundry business including opening multiple foundries in the US. Intel is also developing new GPUs which have large amounts of the gaming community foaming at the mouth for budget GPUs and competition to lower the prices. Intel has also been making the right moves in CPU development, they currently do quite well in single-core performance but lack in multi-core but they're increasing core counts again to improve multi-core performance. Their new Zeon CPUs (low-end enterprise) have an insanely high amount of PCIe lanes (which is good) and show the possibility of bringing back competition against AMD which has gotten lazy in Enterprise. Intel also pays dividends for the dividend lovers out there.
