And that most of the time, you are right in assuming it is a fad that will die out. We've seen that play out over and over again.And I'm not really one to pick a side here. I've been both long and short NVDA in the past year. I don't really know what it's going to do or where it's gonna go.One thing I can tell you though. AI is legit. Very legit. Honestly, what they've done is wildly, wildly impressive. I honestly think this is something that can become bigger than the internet itself.I don't know if NVDA will always be the AI ""king"" as their premium price seems to imply, but they've taken the crown for now.You can't really think about AI in its utility in terms of the end user either - e.g. just asking silly questions like ""what should we eat for dinner tonight"".You need to think more like the head of a major corporation: what can we do with ChatGPT that can streamline our operations, and improve our user experience? Should we invest in the API? Could this be used to automate some of our processes and to cut costs? You need to think of AI as another type of tool (like a spreadsheet except far more powerful) that dramatically simplifies work, substantially increasing productivity.Right now NVDA has basically taken the AI king crown. It is what big fund managers view as the ""safest"" AI beta along with MSFT. What you're seeing is the effect of Wall Street pricing in what they think AI could be capable of doing.It might feel like hype right now, but I think we've only just begun to see the beginning.

CUDA is very important and mostly monopolized, but there are alternatives and they are quickly developing due to the locked-in nature of NVDA AI and CUDA. There are competitors like AMD, Intel, and Broadcom. Not to mention many Chinese companies which likely will take over the Chinese/Russian market due to sanctions.As someone who has worked with LLMs pretty extensively, I see them as one of the clearest practical use cases for AI. There likely will be more applications in the future. However, I've also seen LLMs that were cut down extensively to 7 billion parameters, given access to the internet and external memory, and which perform similarly to GPT 3.5 or Bard.This means that LLMs will become democratized. Anyone can make their own with a few thousand bucks and a programmer. Furthermore, the larger cutting-edge LLM can be cut down to a smaller size for focused applications. These require much less AI training.Cutting-edge research and megafirms and big data centers will need the best LLMs. They will need NVDA gear. But your small companies won't need more than a few weeks with Cloud Access to AI gear to develop their own LLMs. They can then run the cut-down program on an ASIC.NVDA deserves its high valuation. I just don't see it expanding that valuation more when it's not truly a monopoly and demand isn't infinite. AI is training AI to become smarter more efficiently.",2,0.531,0.886,POSITIVE

And I hope it can become democratized.I do know that the data pruning/cleaning, training and RLHF efforts can be expensive in terms of compute and/or hours of human time depending on the scope of the AI. Even a smaller AI will still have its costs to implement - especially if you want to implement one with a minimal amount of bias and variance. There's a lot of human work that has to go into LLMs being as effective as they are.My reply to the OP was less about NVDA and its valuation, and more about what the demand for AI will look like in the future.
