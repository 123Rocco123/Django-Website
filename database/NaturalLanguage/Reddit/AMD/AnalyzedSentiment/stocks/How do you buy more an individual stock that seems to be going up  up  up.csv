Let's assume it grows by 10% over the next decade. 2023: 11B, 2024: 12.1..etc.Now, let's sum all of this money: you're gonna get a number around 160B.Now, you get that in 10 years, assuming a 10% growth, that's 160B. Current Coca Cola market cap is 266B thus FCF in 10 years over market cap is 60%. This is not really great. You can get *more* money, and safer, if you invest in bonds. In fact, you should discount annualized growth by 5% bond yields (so 5% instead of 10%).That means that Coca Cola's price is not attractive to me as an investor right now.Now, if the price was 40$...The ratio would be more or less 1 and it would be more attactive. It's 60$ now. Obviously Coca Cola is a wonderful business and a nice stock which is why it gets such premium price over its financials.A faster rule of thumb I have is this:- if the current price is 100 (of whatever stock), do I believe that 10 years from now the company will have 85 of earnings? Meaning I'm willing to pay for a growth company 100B today if I believe it will be making 85 B at least 10 years from now.Let's do an Nvidia example.Nvidia has a 1.1 T market cap. Do I believe they will have 900+ B in earnings in 2023? Obviously not, it's crazy, that would demand a constant growth around 45% per year for a decade, those are not realistic figures, especially in cyclical markets like tech.Last important note, there's companies (such as energy or raw materials) that have earnings much higher than their book value those rules do not apply to them.",2,0.564,0.758,NEGATIVE
