,"So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years. I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030. However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now. I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices. The plan: -Buy 100 shares of LYMS (European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ - I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done) -Buy around 2 500 $ worth of Norwegian dividend stocks (Done) -Buy shares in AMD for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs) -Buy shares in Alphabet ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now) -Buy shares sin Tesla Corp TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030) -Buy shares in TSMC TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible) -Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to bank account I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time) Some possible additions right now: -Considering Invesco S&P 500 UCITS ETF Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises) -Considering Franklin FTSE China UCITS ETF FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention) -Considering Franklin FTSE India UCITS ETF FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment) -Considering Apple APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually) -Considering Microsoft MSF, Meta FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either) -Considering Amazon (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time) -Berkshire Hathaway Class B BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here) -Considering Palantir PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights) -Considered Nvidia (FOMO) -Considered IBM and Intel as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term) So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies? Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)","This feels like you are just making your own S&P 500 but worse and Meme-ier. It feels like the end result of this will be a portfolio that mirrors the market but just vaguely worse.Like not even a wallstreets bet thing where it will definitely go bad but you can imagine it being some 1 in a million win. It just seems like ""I would like market returns but kinda maybe trail them slightly""",0,0.53,1.0,NEGATIVE

It is not in the list of things I plan to buy immediately mostly because risk due to an expected American recession seems to weaken Norway's national currency, as it is seen as a currency that inherently carries higher risk than the Euro and Dollar, and in turn I will, until a soft landing has occurred or a contraction/recession has happened, be weaker due to investors being more risk averse. Essentially allowing me to buy less S&P 500 for the same money compared to what will likely be the case half a year or so from now regardless of whether the US faces a recession or soft landing (recession->lower stock prices->cheaper ETF shares), (soft landing->stronger NOK->cheaper ETF shares). Normally 1 USD would be like 8-9 NOK, but this year it has been more like 10-11, assuming 9 is the normal that would make buying the S&P 500 22% more expensive than its current price, now about 11%.

They have been stagnating for the last decade. If you bought Apple strictly and sold CC’s above strike you would probably win more without the headache of diversification. I would narrow it down to 1-2 ETF’s that have high volume so you sell weekly’s against them (SPY) or (JEPI if you want dividend and are in a tax free account) then focus on 5 companies you believe will be around forever like KO or AMZN. Target things people need and legacy business that have a proven track record of printing money (googl) (major financial institutions that own the world like BLK),0,0.526,0.999,NEGATIVE

If I follow the ""common sense"" strategy you would find recommended to Americans I screw myself because I will massively increase how much I will have to pay in taxes off of this. I am trying to adapt it to work from Norway, though.It might now have come across clearly enough - the last part where I mention stocks that I have been or am considering, but not planning to buy, should probably not have been in the post. AMD, Alphabet, Tesla, and TSMC are the stocks that make the cut for me. Apple might be a better stock than those, especially AMD if AMD fails to produce as good, or better, AI chips than Nvidia like I think they will succeed in.I think your philosophy when selecting companies to hold long term is very sensible in general, and that the specific examples (KO, AMZN, GOOGL, BLK) are good buys too.The specifics of this look a bit different from Norway. Essentially I want my index tracking ETFs and dividends to be tax free and Europe domiciled so I don't pay taxes on the sure thing. My risiker investments into specific companies will be in a different kind of account where I am allowed to buy American stocks, pay taxes on dividends, but also can make tax write offs should the price fall. So what I am looking for is stocks that can give a high pay off with a somewhat higher risk tolerance than what I have in general.I am holding off on putting everything into stocks and ETFs because I am waiting for either:An American contraction/recession to buy in cheaperA soft landing increasing risk tolerance in the American market, in turn strengthening Norway's national currency, likely still allowing me to buy in cheaper.The only market segment I don't think I benefit from holding off a bit in is AI as I can totally see stock prices for companies involved never come back down where it is today as more of the potential of the technology becomes clear. Should I be wrong and the market crash that is even better as I have the money to buy the dip.If I am wrong about something or you would have done something different yourself I appreciate the feedback! :)",1,0.542,1.0,NEGATIVE

Right now I own 3 stocks of which I truly understand 1, and have a decent level of knowledge of the other 2, and then some bitcoin which I hold a solid understanding of.So if you want to pick stocks, which contrary to popular believe is very doable as a retail investor (without the downside of having to avoid downturns like fund manager) even if it might take you a few years to develop sufficient understanding to outperform the market, I would recommend a few companies you really understand and spent tens if not hundreds of hours researching over ""diversifying"" into 10 stocks you only know the basics of.

It seems the consensus in the responses here is I am not far enough along that spectrum for this to be much more than gambling at the time being.I think I might still buy shares in the companies mentioned, but fewer, and to instead prioritize buying shares in an S&P 500 tracing ETF (P500).",1,0.518,1.0,NEGATIVE

Investing a little so you're not just investing with paper money is definitely a necessity to really learn how to invest, but unless you're willing to risk losing a significant part of what you're starting with it's probably smart to start smaller (like 25-50% of your money) and put the rest in an ETF.Just know that while you probably want to shift towards 100% in picked stocks over time, it's very difficult to decide when is the time. I probably would've thought ~6 months in I knew enough, when in actuality I needed ~2 years before I really started to get a grasp on what kind of knowledge was needed before investing in a company.",2,0.53,0.999,NEGATIVE

I will probably scale the amount invested in stock down slightly due to the fairly consistent feedback that I am gambling hahahI have been looking into other's opinions about each of those, P/E, earnings and debt over time, future price estimates, and where the price stands historically, but I totally believe you because these days I feel I learn something new that slightly changes how I see investing every other day!With that said I have taken a course in Macroeconomics and Behavioural economics, watched a ton of YouTube videos about how to go about this, and become fairly fond of Investopedia. The reason I am not fully getting started before now is mostly that there's a lot of technicalities these books, videos, and pages don't describe that are more particular to Norway. Specifically Norwegian taxation rules that are very generous for some assets, but less so for others, which is why I prefer the P500 to VOO, for instance, even though it has higher fees. And yeah not to mention that the current exchange rate has to enter the picture at all times in a way it doesn't have to when you are investing directly using Euros or Dollars.For me these standard ETFs have had their price elevated about 15-22% almost the entire year until now if we are being pessimistic about where the national currency will eventually stabilize simply due to exchange rate. I was not aware how great the impact of risk aversity in the American market on the Norwegian national currency was until now, but I guess I know for next time.I have applied for being allowed to own Euros and Dollars directly on a Norwegian brokerage and I won't buy any international stocks until I can do that. I will buy ETFs, though, as European based ETFs that track American indicies get the tax benefits I touched on earlier in Norway.",3,0.533,0.611,POSITIVE
