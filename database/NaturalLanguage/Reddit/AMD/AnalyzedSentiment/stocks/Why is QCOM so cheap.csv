If investors last quarter are starting to pay attention to capex spending by hyperscalers and looking for revenue growth to justify those spending, I don't see how the hyperscalers can continue to keep increasing their capex, especially when the economy is slowing. Furthermore, they have increased their capex for almost 2 years now and it's probably getting to a point where they need to slow down and observe the results of their investments, especially when their revenue growth YoY is starting to decelerate.",1,0.531,0.992,NEGATIVE

I’m not as familiar with AMDs products so I wouldn’t personally touch that, but if it has skin in AI scaling, take it.The thing is, we are in a tech war with scaling gen AI systems with the biggest, most profitable and cash rich companies. They have not seen a slowing of results through scaling, and none of them can cut back on spending while the others are still spending. If they do, they will fall behind and may never catch up. In fact, even more players are continuing to enter the race.This will not end until some other resource depletes and gates scaling. Right now it’s silicon, next will likely be energy. Utilities, batteries, etc.Or, when scaling AI systems shows decreasing returns. But this is hard to define because a small increase in neural net size (relatively, say 10x) for say 100x the cost SEEMS on the surface to be a poor investment. You get 1/10 of the scale per unit of cost. However what matters is capability, and then application of that capability.This may go on for several years, or more. This silicon cycle is not one that I’d say for sure will follow the typical semi cycles. Eventually of course it will, I just don’t think the timelines are remotely the same",2,0.532,0.986,NEGATIVE

While they are first provider of ARM for Windows, they are in a crowded segment with AMD and Intel in their heels. Snapdragon X surely offers ARM as first for Windows, but we will need to see sales before concluding them the winner. Intel's Lunar lake more closely copies the M chips from Apple. Meanwhile, sales have slumped for Apple on the M series as the upgrades becomes less and less, while there is a big chunk of upgrades for Windows, similar is expected but with more competition. QCOM is big in mobile, but again, many competitors with recent Huawei ban, Google's chips for Pixel etc. catching up to speed, QCOM is not market leader at the moment, etc.I think QCOM was a great buy before people started to discover it when NVDA went amok, I think they are decently priced now with potential upside, just not sure how high an upside and whether we will see the chip market slump a bit before taking off again.Curious to hear other's opinion and analysis.EDIT: Brooos and the event I had not expected, a lot of talk about it, but still sounded a bit unlikely - Apple has dropped QCOM for cellular chips due to in-house efforts.

I've looked into some retailers that actually stock them and provide sales numbers - x86 laptops outsell Snapdragon by several orders of magnitude.On the business side of things I don't think they will make an impact. Companies that use Windows often don't want to shift from Intel to AMD and now we are talking about a completely different CPU architecture. Company I work for will never use ARM laptops, I am absolutely sure about it. It would require supporting tools for two architectures for absolutely no gain whatsoever.

Agree, there is a lack of commitment from MSFT to ARM to push developers to make better integrations with compatibility. Rosetta helps somewhat, but nowhere near the conversion we saw Apple do a couple of years back - with pretty much everything working on M chips.Also, already saw a ton of discounts of high end brands with the Snapdragon X, not sure what to make of it.Overall, I think the benefits of ARM is quite clearly demonstrated by Apple, most of the world today is mobile with laptops being the primary work station. Battery life is great and the high performance for office related apps are the most important. I see your point in many Windows user also using prof software that is currently not running on ARM. But with the performance of various video editing software etc. on M chips, I would hope prof software moves to ARM soon enough.

It just so happens that ARM has a flexible licence that did not constrain Apple in terms of manufacturing. Intel designing and manufacturing their CPUs meant that once they fell behind in one area, the whole product is not very compelling. Only recently did Intel removed that constrain from their product team - they are now allowed to manufacture their designs externally.Which leads us to what you've mentioned in your first post. Intel is going to introduce Lunar Lake soon, which is an x86 design specifically built for battery life and efficiency in mind. What's important is that they will use leading-edge TSCM nodes for production, as well as simplifying the power delivery design to make them easier to deploy in a predictable manner by their partners.Most probably this will make Snapdragon X Elite completely redundant three months after release.",3,0.522,1.0,NEGATIVE

India is the fastest growing major economy and will only continue to do so with a 6%-8% GDP growth surpassing China. World’s largest population, and biggest young population. More than 50% under 25 and 65% under 35, highly educated and can speak English. So we aren’t just talking factory workers, but also software developers. As the economy grows the middle class will as well, and the financial sector will continue to boom. I also like ICICI out of there since they deal with more corporate loans.As for trades: HROW bought calls a year out when they were valued at $750m. They make an eye anesthetic IHEEZO which got FDA approval and caught my attention. They also have a few other drugs which were ramping up. At its $750m valuation seemed like they had an easy path to $1b in revenue, and I was essentially just paying for 1 drug. Sure enough, my calls sold for $4000 each after its recent run up. I did not expect it to pay off so quickly.Now tell me, what do you buy? Or do you just come on reddit harassing people you disagree with? It’s not that deep buddy.",5,0.544,1.0,NEGATIVE
