Everyone is trying to scale up to being able to use it, the chatbots and such available now are just toys. But from the software side everyone is trying to increase efficiency in being able to produce advanced AI. Right now it takes a ton of infrastructure and Nvidia is the only one capable of providing that. Others (AMD) will likely catch up eventually. And there are more competing trends: more hardware right now directly corresponds to more advanced AI. Advances in the software space will decrease the hardware needed to get to advanced ai, but more available applications of AI will drive the need up at the same time.So from the finance side: I know less about this, but it seems like a very volatile space. A lot of promise is probably creating a bubble effect. There are a lot of analogues to the dot com: we know it’s gunna be big, but we don’t understand how yet. A lot of companies are going to blow up on promise and then go under. I don’t know how to make savvy decisions here yet, but what I am sure of is that I should watch it carefully but do anything very cautiously.",0,0.542,0.998,NEGATIVE
