Then there‚Äôs MSFT and ODFL. Then SBUX and SPOT. Then probably AMD and ABNB or MTCH.Option 1: HD is a solid company that already has its hold, pays a great dividend, and I don‚Äôt see it going anywhere. Nice and steady growth. Axon makes tasers and software/cloud for them. It‚Äôs more of a long term growth play for me. I see their high growth rate continuing, possibly with ups and downs, but ultimately police around the world will be pushed toward tasers and body cams more. Note that they recently released a new taser that has ‚Äústopping power‚Äù that can potentially be safer for police.Option 2: MSFT is a solid company, known revenue streams and a lot of potential as technology continues to grow. Also offers a small dividend and has buybacks. ODFL is a shipping company that has good margins and is extremely efficient. More consumption means more demand. Has a good dividend.Option 3: SBUX has known Revenue streams, good dividend, and coffee is a legal drug. White chicks won‚Äôt give up Starbucks. They‚Äôre having a tough time in China atm but they‚Äôre on the right track. SPOT has the majority of music streaming market, I believe they have pricing power as well. They haven‚Äôt taken advantage of that, but I think they could raise prices 20-40% and not lose a significant amount of subscribers. Also they‚Äôre slowly getting into podcasts and audiobooks, it‚Äôs been slow but again on the right track.Option 4: AMD well it‚Äôs AMD, they have great leadership, good market share, and a good product. Technology is going to keep creating more and more demand. ABNB has its niche, hotels are great but so are airbnbs. I see the potential here but I know lots won‚Äôt. Could swap it with MTCH, which dominates online dating. I‚Äôm on the younger side, but the kids younger than me seriously lack social skills. Covid did a real number on a whole generation. I think online dating is going to be the main way future generations meet people. They‚Äôre introducing a $500 membership and i know people will pay that much (you see the guy dropping $100k/month on onlyfans). Also check our many Asian countries and South America having pop growth issues, online dating will likely do well in those areas.Incase you didn‚Äôt notice the pattern I think it is best to pick one really solid company that will match or maybe beat the market but you don‚Äôt have to worry much.
