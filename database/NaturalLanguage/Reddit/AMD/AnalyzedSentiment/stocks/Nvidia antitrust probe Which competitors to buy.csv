Microsoft and Amazon have just entered into this space, and are only on their first or second gen. And that’s not even talking about the software Google has built out for their TPUs. Half the process is the chip, the other half is the compiler/ inference engine / runtime environment, another aspect where Google’s time in the market benefits them, as they’ve had much more time than Google and Amazon to build out their software stack.No, they probably won’t end up selling their TPUs individually to businesses.

There's a place and nice.LLMs so far aren't generating meaningful revenue for end customers (while different story, I digress) and as most LLMs converge in terms of performance, the game then changes to who can perform inference faster and cheaper.

I think it's fair to assume they should be worth $10B-$15B based on conservative multipliers around sales/growth.But we all know IPOs can cause some crazy valuations. Personally, I would be hesitant to invest in the first 6 months of the IPO if their valuation is anything above $20B (take a look at $SNOW's crazy valuation history).If you can get some around $10B-$15B from IPO, then it's probably worth it.",2,0.538,1.0,NEGATIVE
