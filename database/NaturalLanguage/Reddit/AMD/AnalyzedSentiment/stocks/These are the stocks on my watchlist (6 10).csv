","Yes- essentially they're diluting the company if you're a shareholder.Imagine a company has 100M shares outstanding, and a market cap of $1B- the share price is (theoretically) at $10.If a company has a share offering for 10M shares, then there's now 110M shares outstanding, and the market cap stays the same- $1B/110M = $9.09 per share.Also people perceive it as the company needed to give up some control of their company for more cash (on the other hand, most well-performing companies want to control more of their stock in order to reap more of their own earnings and make the shares their current shareholders hold worth MORE).Something that stuck out to me was that the share offering for GME is close to 25% of the shares outstanding- that's HUGE, because 10% share offerings are considered ""large"". Management was trying to capitalize on the price spike. However, GME has a pretty big cash position so who knows what they're going to do with it.",1,0.588,1.0,NEGATIVE
