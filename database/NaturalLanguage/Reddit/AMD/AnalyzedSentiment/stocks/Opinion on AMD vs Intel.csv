About 2 years ago, it almost felt like Intel was just a blast from the past, AMD will finally be the next leader in the CPU market, at least thats what the stock prices looked like. But then, Intels performance throughout this year has been a slow, but steady gain, while AMD has been well below its ATH. What will the future bring? Intel has just recently confirmed its ramp in production capacity, while AMD as a fabless company is strongly dependent on foundries like TSMC, who, howerer, have already confirmed to prioritize apple, nvidia and then also intel with their 3nm node.

Apple is the largest company and both of them rely on TSMC which is the 12th largest.This is fine, with the margins Nvidia has the cost of manufacturing is minor. Their focus should be spent working on their technological advantage, which is what is allowing them to maintain those high margins.Fabless means you can shop around and use whoever has the best silicon, which pushes your products further ahead.

Samsung is nearly as much of a meme as Intel is for yields and deadlines.TSMC is valid, but even Intel's 'non leadership' nodes aren't bad in comparison to TSMC. Intel 20A is esentially a nerfed TSMC 3nm with all the DTCO goodies of BSPD and GAAEFET. TSMC isn't getting GAAFET until 2nm, and not getting BSPD until N2P. You obviously don't need those two extra features for a node to be good, but they add extra layers of flexibility that separates them from TSMC as a node and gives another reason for customers to warm up for Intel 20A/Intel 18A.Intel 4 is impressive for what it is, density wise. TSMC 3nm level HP cell density. I'm guessing perf/watt isn't up to par to call it a ""3nm"" class node though, it lacks HD cells, and SRAM density is horrendous. Intel 3 looks to be fine though, albeit still worse than TSMC 3nm. It's going to have to be priced worse than TSMC 3nm, but tbh even if Intel 3 was better than TSMC 3nm, they would still be forced to price those wafers low since they are unproven, etc etc.",3,0.517,0.861,POSITIVE

But I currently have AMD and INTC and NVDA.The reason is they offer different risk/reward propositions and different (perceived) times scales and values.I would have sold AMD at my $130 PT but missed, so I've been marking time with it. The thesis is that if they make some well received announcements in the coming months, my PT might be attainable.INTC is for value, with more of a time-based exit around foundry and domestic chip production that's one or more years out.NVDA is for the shortest term, when it dipped to $425 in the quiet period before an anticipated earnings report. My sense from extrapolating comments from company officials made just before the quiet period was that their business was so overwhelmingly strong that any or all hiccups with China would be meaningless. I then averaged up between $425 and $450 and had an exit PT of $525. I think $5252 was hit, but not during regular session, so ended up holding it. I'll give it a 10% down stop from here so it won't hurt me. If it does hit my PT really quickly, I'll be out.

Otherwise, we just have to take Intel's word for it.They appear to be missing the AI bubbleI mean compared to Nvidia, sure. But compared to Intel? I mean they have Gaudi ig...and TSMC is prioritizing others for their most advanced processesI don't think that's as much as TSMC not prioritizing AMD as much as AMD not wanting to use TSMC's cutting edge process. AMD typically doesn't use TSMC's latest node, for a couple reasons really. Cost, node maturity, volume, just to name a few. Yet AMD is still using N3 for Zen 5 (likely Zen 5-C based DC products), and these are probably launching around the same time as Intel's TSMC 3nm based Arrow Lake CPUs.which lets INTC catch up more easily in the datacenter (they already caught up on Client)Definitely. And Intel has actually been slowly climbing back starting with ICL really in terms of how competitive they are. I still expect GNR to be worse than Turin, but it looks like it would close the gap even more than say, SPR vs Genoa. However it's important to remember that node isn't everything- core design heavily matters as well. And I don't think AMD is losing in that department vs Intel either.",1,0.538,1.0,NEGATIVE

GNR should be ~iso node vs Turin and Genoa though. In the comment above, I was specifically talking about SPR vs Milan, which are iso node. Genoa has AVX-512, though SPR still has larger core private caches and AMX.New products might close that gap but for the near future they are buying silicon from their largest foundry competitor, TSMNot for their flagship DC products, Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest. These products are those that should be getting the highest margins as well.Clearwater Forest continues that trend with using Intel 18A.The products that use TSMC are GPUs/GPU tiles, LNL and the CPU tiles for ARL, and related SOC tiles for client. However, they are also fabbing client products using their own nodes as well, Intel has reiterated the existence of 20A ARL tiles numerous times so far.

When Pat talked about stemming the bleed of CPU marketshare in the DC market, it's not because SPR was competitive with Genoa, it's because they priced SPR insanely low compared to what it cost to make.As for the 'real performance upside', Intel has a better argument there than with client through the use of specialized core extensions (AVX-512, AMX) as well as HBM.

Opening Uncle Sam's wallet for investments in Intel. However they're still technologically behind and have been for years now. They have a plan, and they need to execute on that plan to succeed. Until then they're dead to me.If war breaks out in Taiwan, I think Intel will surge for being in the US. I expect TSMC to go up in flames in that scenario, and AMD will absolutely tank. TSMC is building fabs in US to mitigate this risk.Until Intel catches up to AMD technologically (if they ever do), AMD will continue to take market share from Intel imo. AMD may be threatened by NVIDIA's AI dominance by being slightly later with their chip, but I think Intel is devastatingly behind on AI chips. I've seen some analysts wonder, if NVIDIA will sit so hard on the AI chip market, that everyone else has missed the boat. Everyone is pouring money into AI chips, and if they're all buying NVIDIA, it can be hard to get them to buy something else later on. Either because of the tech/architecture/software or simply because money dries up for additional investments. I've also read that AMD's forthcoming AI chip can certainly compete with NVIDIA. So far I consider that marketing and rumours, but I have faith in Lisa Su.My money's on AMD, but with the China-Taiwan risk, it wouldn't hurt to have some Intel as well.",0,0.561,0.997,NEGATIVE

I fully expect Intel to continue selling their Xeons at terrible margins in order to stem AMD from gaining market share. And I'm guessing AMD is relatively fine with this lol, considering they are going to be selling their CPUs at comparatively crazy high margins where perf is more important.AMD may be threatened by NVIDIA's AI dominance by being slightly later with their chip, but I think Intel is devastatingly behind on AI chipsI think this is a pretty fair assessment. Ponte Vecchio looks like a HPC focused, massively complex GPU that I doubt is going to be able to ramp much at all simply because of how ridiculously complex it is for the perf a customer can get. To be fair though, Intel also has Habana. Hugging Face recently released an article talking about how Gaudi 2 can be optimized to run 40% faster than H100s in vision-language models.While CPUs will be obviously less powerful for most tasks, Intel claims that something like 1/4 of SPR sales were related to AI as well.I've also read that AMD's forthcoming AI chip can certainly compete with NVIDIAHardware wise, based on rumored TFlops, it looks like it could, but the main point of contention is the software gap.",1,0.562,1.0,NEGATIVE

Last I checked, AMD has both now. So no surprise amd has been taking their market share and, by extension, no surprise amd has a higher market cap now. They are pivoting to chip fab at least in part because the rest of their business is failing due to poor execution.",0,0.596,0.964,NEGATIVE
