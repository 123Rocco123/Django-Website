,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc. gave an upbeat revenue forecast for the current quarter, signaling that its new artificial intelligence processors are helping bolster growth. Revenue will be roughly $6.7 billion in the third quarter, the chipmaker said in a statement Tuesday. Analysts estimated $6.62 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The outlook suggests that AMD is making headway in its pursuit of Nvidia Corp., which dominates the market for so-called AI accelerators — chips used to develop artificial intelligence models. Nvidia has capitalized on booming demand to send its shares and stock price soaring over the past year, becoming the world’s most valuable chipmaker in the process. Now AMD is looking to make inroads with its own lineup, called MI300. AMD is Nvidia’s nearest rival in the market, but still trailing by a wide margin. The hope is to gain more of the money that data-center operators such as Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are pouring into the creation of AI tools. AMD shares rose about 2% in extended trading following the announcement. They had earlier closed at $138.44 in New York, leaving them down 6.1% for the year. AMD’s quarterly report kicks off a week of earnings updates from large semiconductor makers. Qualcomm Inc., Arm Holdings Plc and Intel Corp. all report numbers this week, and it comes at a delicate time for the chip industry.

Revenue will be roughly $6.7 billion in the third quarter, the chipmaker said in a statement Tuesday. Analysts estimated $6.62 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The outlook suggests that AMD is making headway in its pursuit of Nvidia Corp., which dominates the market for so-called AI accelerators — chips used to develop artificial intelligence models. Nvidia has capitalized on booming demand to send its shares and stock price soaring over the past year, becoming the world’s most valuable chipmaker in the process. Now AMD is looking to make inroads with its own lineup, called MI300. AMD is Nvidia’s nearest rival in the market, but still trailing by a wide margin. The hope is to gain more of the money that data-center operators such as Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are pouring into the creation of AI tools. AMD shares rose about 2% in extended trading following the announcement. They had earlier closed at $138.44 in New York, leaving them down 6.1% for the year. AMD’s quarterly report kicks off a week of earnings updates from large semiconductor makers.

The problem is that developers have been educationally invested into Nvidia software to work on AI products. Nvidia software was the best tbf. And because Nvidia doesn't allow other hardware to use the software commercially, companies have to buy Nvidia cards.AMD did try successfully to support the inofficial use of Nvidia software for their hardware by supporting unaffiliated devs who made it possible but since large companies can't use them officially, they can't create products with it.Will be interesting how AMD can fix that bc devs will unlikely be willing to move over to AMD software when they are already experts in Nvidia software. Similar problem existed when Android and Apple dominated the mobile apps market. Noone could pull the devs to new platformsOne possibility could be companies/job market pressuring devs to adopt AMD because they can't buy nvidia hardware with the shortage on supply. But without machine learning libraries adopted or recreated for other tools, it is not practical for devs to switch over.(Supplement words with Cuda API and machine learning Libraries, which are the crucial software advantage other companies have trouble competing with)",0,0.571,1.0,NEGATIVE
