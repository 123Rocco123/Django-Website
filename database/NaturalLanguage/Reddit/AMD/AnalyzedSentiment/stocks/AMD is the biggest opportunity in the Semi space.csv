Standard business dev. However Intel screwed up last two releases and as hardware architects we simply could not use them in our builds because AMD was too far ahead. We will be using intels new processors and will see how those go but they look okay on paper. Having two vendors is also ideal because it lets us source from two different supply chains which reduces risk. It’s not all just about performance there are several factors to consider.

There has been some concern this week with Micron and the PC business but i think the market is overlooking the fact that there is a massive upgrade cycle coming for AI personal computers. Think about all the outdated PC's that are currently out there. That's thousands of companies and corporations, Universities/colleges/schools, data centers and personal home computers that are not optimized for AI and the AI apps that will come down the pipeline next year. The addressable market is massive, this isn't limited to the US but think Europe, Asia, South America all looking to have an AI enabled PC in their office or home. You cant have the AI software development without having AI enabled PC's. Apple discovered this with their AI phones. You need upgrades on CPU's, Upgraded GPU's, Upgraded RAM and hard drives/storage. Next lets talk about custom chip designs. The market went wild when Broadcom brought this up. No one realizes that AMD has been working on this for a while. They also make AI accelerators that directly compete with everyone else in performance. Their website has a list of their products this isnt something new they are jumping into. https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-ai-matures-chip-industry-will-look-beyond-gpus-amd-chief-says-fec6776a The total addressable market is massive. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amds-dr-lisa-su-predicts-172450644.html AMD keeps beating earnings expectations consistently.

,"To the victor go the spoils and AMD beat Intel, so now its time to reap the rewards of being the biggest in their space. I think Intel will be sold and parts of their business bought out by various companies and the Fab business separated from the chip side of things.

We started at $160 down to $130 and now $118.Biggest semi opportunity is Nvidia. Based on analyst expectations they’re poised to double again in the next 2 years.AMD isn’t going to grow just because it had a bad year. It jumped 128% in 2023 despite not having much AI datacenter revenue. This year the stock has repriced since their AI revenue is still tiny next to Nvidia. Next year they’re expected to double again $10b in AI sales and 55% margin compared to $160b and 75% margin for Nvidia.Buy AMD if you want but it would be a fraction of your Nvidia position.,0,0.62,NEGATIVE,1.0
