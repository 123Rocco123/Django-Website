And then some high risk long term individual stocks like rivian, palintir and intel if it continues to drop for a while. I’d say aapl and Tesla are pretty high risk as well and may drop before they rise again, if they rise. AAPL because Tim Cook has no vision and Tesla because Elon is aging and getting crazier and is still overworking himself and still shit posting on a platform that he lost over $20 billion on.

You are going from a balanced portfolio to an unbalanced tech/growth portfolio based on past performance.Take 10% of your portfolio - just 10% - and invest it in your best 5 stocks. Maybe best 3. And see how you do, and if you are comfortable owning stocks.After two or three years, start to add to that if you want. Go to 20%. And then shift 10% every year after that.Don't jump in with both feet. You don't know what you are doing yet. You haven't experienced 50% down on everything you own and 90% down on some of it yet, and you aren't likely to get that with VOO. But it will happen to you in growth stocks, even these.
