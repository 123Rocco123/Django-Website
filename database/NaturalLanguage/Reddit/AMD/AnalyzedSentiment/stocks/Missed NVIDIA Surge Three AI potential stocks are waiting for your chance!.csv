,"This year, stocks of the “Big 7,” including Amazon, Meta Platforms, Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple, have soared, including a nearly 3% gain on Wednesday. Tech ETFs have hit 29 new highs this year. Oracle: strong growth, attractive valuation Oracle shares fell 6% to $178 after reporting fiscal second-quarter earnings on Monday. Nonetheless, its shares have doubled since the end of 2022. This share price decline is a natural market reaction to high expectations. The earnings report showed good prospects for Oracle future growth. Quarterly revenue rose 8.6% year-on-year to $14.1 billion, with cloud revenue up 24% to $5.9 billion and cloud infrastructure revenue reaching a further $2.4 billion. Oracle is migrating customers from traditional data storage to its efficient AI-enabled services. Future third-quarter revenue is expected to grow 8%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate growth of up to 10% Oracle cloud infrastructure business is growing faster than the industry average, and overall annual revenue growth is expected to remain above 10% going forward. Although AI-related investments will put pressure on margins in the short term, analysts expect its average annual earnings per share growth rate to reach 18% over the next four years. Its current price-to-earnings ratio of 27 times expected earnings over the next 12 months is significantly lower than the average for the U.S. software industry, but its growth outlook is much stronger and the stock has room for further upside Teradyne: Robotics and Chip Testing Shares of Teradyne, a $19 billion robotics and chip-testing equipment maker, are down about 27% from their summer high of $163.21, and currently stand at $120. A recent slowdown in capital spending by industrial customers has led to a deceleration in growth in its industrial business, but the long-term outlook remains positive Sales in this segment are expected to recover as industrial customers resume investment in automation equipment. Meanwhile, growing demand for AI chips is driving increased demand for chip test equipment. Total revenue for the third quarter increased 5% to $737 million. The analysis predicts that the market in which Teradyne is located could reach $19 billion by the end of the century, with its industry position strong and only Tokyo-based Advantest as its main competitor Analysts expect Teradyne revenue and earnings per share to grow to $4.1 billion and $5.99, respectively, by 2026. If the company proves to be on a good trajectory, shares are expected to rally. Its price-to-earnings ratio is currently 28 times, down from a yearly high of 37 times AMD: The AI chip chaser AMD shares fell 39% to $127 from a high of $227.30 in March as AI chip sales missed expectations. However, the company recently raised its full-year revenue guidance to $5 billion from $4.5 billion AMD CEO Zifeng Su said the long-term size of the AI chip market could exceed $500 billion. NVIDIA currently occupies a $100 billion market, but customers still need to diversify their supply chains, and AMD is the second-biggest option after NVIDIA Analysts expect AMD annual sales of data center chips, including AI chips, to grow 36% to $31 billion by 2027. A lower price-to-earnings ratio (26x vs. Nvidia 33x) also provides upside to its stock price These three companies are uniquely positioned for long-term growth potential in the AI wave, and may be worth considering as a “second tier” for investors who missed Nvidia surge",Why do you assume the market hasn't priced this in already?,0,0.556,NEGATIVE,0.995
