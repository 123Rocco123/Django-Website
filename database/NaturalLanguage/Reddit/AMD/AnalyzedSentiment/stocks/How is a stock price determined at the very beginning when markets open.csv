,"When the market closes the stock has a fixed price. We have trading during closing hours and that affects the price as well. But I have seen multiple times on stocks such as AMD that when I open an order to buy before the opening hours, I have to pay more than the price during closing hours. I don't understand how can the price jump when I sent my order a few minutes before the market opens.","The Ask and the BidThe potential buyers announce a price they would be willing to pay, known as the ""bid."" The potential sellers announce a price they would be willing to sell, known as the ""ask."" A market maker in the middle works to create liquidity by facilitating trades between the two parties. NotePut simply, the ask and the bid determine stock price.When a buyer and seller come together, a trade is executed, and the price at which the trade occurred becomes the quoted market value. That's the number you see across television ticker tapes, internet financial portals, and brokerage account pages.source: https://www.thebalancemoney.com/how-stock-prices-are-determined-358144Now that you're aware of Ask and Bid. Outside of official trading hours, there is pre market and after market trading. Trading in this period has much less volume, than during open market. Which can cause Ask and Bid to have a big spread. There are simply not enough orders to fulfill your transaction.For this reason pre market and after market price can be a mirage compared to the price during open market.",0,0.545,0.526,NEGATIVE

Pre market and after hours prices do not always carry over when the market opens. I watch AMD frequently, it happens with any stock. The price is determined by what one is willing to pay and the other is willing to sell!",0,0.581,0.899,POSITIVE
