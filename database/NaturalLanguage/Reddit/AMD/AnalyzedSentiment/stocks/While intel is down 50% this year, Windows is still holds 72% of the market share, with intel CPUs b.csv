Sales are going down and their attempts at a new generation of CPUs have gone from bad to outright failure. This means future prospects are looking rightfully dim...Also consumer CPUs is a miniscule market. The big thing is data centers where Intel used to dominate but now AMD is slowly but surely eating their lunch. AMD also has the whole freaking console market locked down. AMD is growing strongly in every COU sector and Intel is bleeding, they are looking more and more like a zombie company by the day. Rotting from the head and down...So no, OP. Being a former gigant is not enough to be bullish, Nokia used to dominate the global phone market so much their old marketshare was as if you combined Apple and Samsung both! Yet they fell out of favour due to poor leadership and went from globally dominant to penny stock. I'm not saying Intel is dead, but there is litterary no reason to be bullish.

When you look outside the window at industry leaders, you can’t help but think if pay is the reason they are industry leaders when you pay employees top dollars. Intel was an industry leader but paid shit for an industry leader. It’s easy to lose talent to join industry leaders that actually pay industry leading salaries.

Intel still dominates there. AMD’s advantage is less distinct. Power density and thermal density in a rack environment mean PCI lanes aren’t as big of an advantage. You can only pack so much in anyway.Not to mention the desktop market in the corporate space is solidly Intel with AMD not even having a competitive offering. Intels low end chips are enough for these applications, very low cost, and very power efficient at idle, which at scale matters. AMD’s chiplet design means idle power consumption is higher. Thats important because companies upgrade on 4-5 year cycles with many thousands of units. Thats reliable income for Intel AMD can’t touch, and ARM can’t touch until windows for ARM doesn’t suck.Intel has design issues to fix, and manufacturing issues, but a lot of this thread is pump and dump for AMD.

Can Intel actually collapse with so much market share superiority?","Intel as a company basically had 3 moats:x86 dominance in the server market.intel inside cpu dominance for PCs/MacsSoftware moat from years and years of everything basically being written for intel CPUs.Related to (1) and (2) they had the most advanced CPUs and chip manufacturing processes, designs and output. They were the most dominant because they were the best.Since then, they have:under invested in the next generation of chip/fab stuff for servers (eUV tech)have fallen behind on processor design to AMD for x86 - thereby losing ground the server market. (And hobby enthusiasts market as well - but not revenue significant)have lost a major client in the consumer pc space via apple, and now windows has announced partnerships with Qualcomm for ARM ISA computers instead of x86.They missed the boat on mobile CPUs to Qualcomm and have the boat on specialized compute to Nvidia.They are fast losing their software moat as well:Apple proved that cross ISA translation is “good enough”in the server space, AMD is x86, same as intel, and so several applications have a lot less work to do to port stuff over (although not none)AMD servers are so much better at Compute/$ that companies are willing to put in RnD costs to save on capex long or even medium term.They made a half hearted attempt to compete with Qualcomm on mobile and lost, while never even really trying in the GPU/TPU space.If any of the intel original founders were around, they’d be ashamed. Intel used to pride itself on innovating its way out of problems (like breakdown of moore’s law, pre UV lithography) or changes in market conditions (eg death of memory chip manufacturers in the US in light of better and cheaper ships from Japan/Korea).They have entirely lost that edge since sometime in late 2000s and early 2010s and the in the last decade or so all of the rewards from past investments have dried up.So as a value play, Intel is fucked. They have maybe 3-4 years (roughly 2 hardware refresh cycles) to convince people and companies that they have something competitive, otherwise AMD/Qualcomm/Nvidia and even ARM/Samsung will eat their lunch.Intel is now where IBM probably was 30ish years ago and they will likely decline much faster.",0,0.538,0.999,NEGATIVE

Semis are of national strategic importance and the US can't risk sole reliance on anything in Taiwan. If Intel manages to fail, it would be bailed out and stock holders would be wiped. The drop in price now is a confluence of repeated failures over the last few years resulting in lower profits and losing market share. INTC is on a downward trajectory. Can it recover? Sure.

Intel is too far behind in the GPU market; it continues to make mistakes in the CPU business, and its fabrication business is making losses hand over fist. The only way Intel can catch TSMC is if they can get 18A to be reasonably profitable. That's going to be a hard ask, but if it fails, Intel's business model will fail, that's according to Pat Gelsinger.From an outside perspective, it matters not if Intel fails. Companies fail all the time, yes people lose jobs, the market will be volatile, but someone will eventually come along to fill the gap. If Intel fails, the bigger problem for the industry will be what happens after. Intel owns too many valuable IPs so there'll always be interested parties, but Intel will be too expensive no matter how low the stock sinks. There aren't that many companies that can bail out Intel, and the government's competition laws aren't going to like any of the potential buyers.",0,0.539,1.0,NEGATIVE

In that number maybe 0.5% is high end gaming PC's, the other 99.9% is boring office PC's, cash registers, etc.The new fab's in the works caused an huge jump in expenditure and data center sales were down. Data center sales are down because some of their biggest customers are shoveling money into NPU's right now, but that bubble like every other bubble will burst.So basically: no surprises. The AI craze is causing Data Center's to defer CPU upgrades momentarily and yea new Fab's are insanely expensive but the feds are pushing Intel to do so now, and fast thanks to China, and passing up on all that free money would be an even worse move when you zoom out and look at the 10 year horizon.",0,0.555,1.0,NEGATIVE

,"With the rise if AI everybody's talking about GPUs, in the meantime, It's unlikely intel actually goes anywhere in the CPU industry. Can AMD take their market share? Can Intel actually collapse with so much market share superiority?","Break down Intel into two major pillars: Design and manufacturing.Their x86 designs have been dominating the general purpose computing market for nearly 2 decades now. Running anything other than Intel was fairly uncommon and usually was for a reason (budget, special purpose, etc).But x86 nowadays is quickly becoming a relic of the past. ARM designs are much more efficient, and are at a point they can do most of what an Intel chip can do. And if ARM can't do it, it will fall under special purpose computing (like AI chips).Intel and x86 is being squeezed out of the market in favor of more efficient computing and special purpose computing. AMD is also in this box.So that leaves manufacturing, something Intel hasn't been doing great recently. You've seen the articles about oxidization on their chips causing them to malfunction, and the articles about offloading some manufacturing to TSMC. I don't have high hopes for them lapping TSMC, but the possibility is always there. They have an advantage with American HQ and manufacturing, but that factor doesn't seem to be very important, and not worthy enough for an entire market to shift back to.I do not believe in an Intel future, but they still have the possibility to hold on to manufacturing.",0,0.532,0.966,NEGATIVE
