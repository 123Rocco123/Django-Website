The people that don't follow the stock closely will overreact and panic sell or avoid the stock or whatever. But you're more informed, and can capitalize on it. That's your advantage.People just looking at a list of stocks won't have that additional context. And that probably goes for every stock on the list in the original post.Just keep in mind, you can't expect everyone to know every reason why a stock's metrics are temporarily inflated due to a one time charge. It's probably not people deliberately messing it up, it's just that not everyone follows AMD closely and the numbers are valid, but misleading.",1,0.541,0.985,NEGATIVE
