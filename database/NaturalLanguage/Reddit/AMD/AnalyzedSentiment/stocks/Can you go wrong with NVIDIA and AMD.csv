They’re shaping up to be two of the biggest players in an industry that is going to 10x in the next 7 years. Where is the risk?,"My reasoning is simply my bad experiences with high valuation tech. It may not be rational but it is painful history. Besides having about $500k in my 401k in early 2000 mostly in growth, I got a huge bonus that year of near $400,000 and I invested $250,000 in single issue tech stocks. I also bought two corvettes. 18 months later my Corvettes were worth close to the same $100,000 but my $250,000 of stock was worth less than $50,000 which I needed to help pay the tax I owed on that bonus. So I simply don't like investing in high flying tech companies. I have been there and done that and suffered enough that I won't do it again. But particularly if you are young and investing for retirement decades out you can outwait Tech performance like the Amazon price drop from $90 in early 2000 to $6 in 2010 and up to whatever it is now. If you can handle that kind of drop and dry period before you need the money there is no reason not to buy either. I do expect 20-40 years from now they will be a lot higher than they are now.

Six weeks later, when all the profits were tallied, operating earnings for tech stocks came in at $7.69.If analysts can be off by nearly 25 percent in forecasting earnings of a quarter that has just ended, what confidence can investors have in their prediction for the coming year - or, for that matter, for the next three to five years?
