Naturally, Tesla will be behind on actually having a driverless car out there, but once they get that done, they’re finished.

And add to that - the valuation ratios (price-to-earnings, price-to-sales, etc.) of these companies right now are generally more expensive than they've been in the past (when logically the valuation ratios should be lower with 4-5% interest rates and the law of large numbers kicking in - which naturally makes it harder for huge companies to grow percentage-wise as they mature).",0,0.558,1.0,NEGATIVE

They also had declining revenue in 2016 yet look at where they are now. Also their decline in 2016 was way steeper than 2022 to 2023. Their revenue decreased 2.8% from 2022 to 2023. How terrible. Oh yeah sounds like their in big trouble after big double digit increases the years prior but that 3% decline in one year I guess that means its the end of Apple right? Also have you not been paying attention to their Services division? Thats where their growth is coming from. Plus expansion into other markets like India.,4,0.557,1.0,NEGATIVE

Apple does not have many avenues of big revenue growth ahead of them. Yes they can milk their existing users and add a few more, but the declines seen in recent times show a picture of a matured yet stagnating company. I know this is blasphemy to a lot of Apple stock (or product) owners, but any other company with these kind of growth rates would not have the stock valuation Apple has.",5,0.588,1.0,NEGATIVE
