,"I realized capital losses last year on many stocks, including PYPL, DIS and BABA and I might realized more losses by end of this year on ENPH, NIO and GM. On the other hand, I have unrealized gains on stocks I bought last year close to bottom, including AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL and AMD. I do not want to sell my winner because I believe in those stocks for long term. So I now have large realized capital losses with little capital gains. I cannot recover these losses if I do not sell my winners. Should I create a separate small account for short term investment to buy and sell stocks to recover these losses? I know it might take years but I am ok with that. Any suggestions?","I think you're confusing things.Capital gains/losses for taxes- you can write off 3k of losses per year. If you lost more, you can carry the extra forward to future years. This is a good thing, you don't want to sell winners to balance the year to 0 because you lose the tax advantage of the loss.Recovering losses typically means my account is down X amount and I want to try to earn it back. If you've lost money in a stock and sold it, you can put the money towards other things that you expect to perform better to hope it grows back. That's about it.",0,0.541,0.985,NEGATIVE

I know it might take years but I am ok with that. Any suggestions?","What is your point? Why is that bad? Why do you want to sell a winner just to balance things? The money is already invested, the stock has gone down, you need to think with a clear slate. If you trust stock A more, invest into that. If you don't trust stock B, sell it. It doesn't matter what happened oro what you started with, what you have now is what you have and other than tax liability of sales, you should just be focused on how to grow your money.Having a bad year on paper is meaningless other than the tax deductions. Balancing it out to an even year means nothing, but selling a stock you believe in to balance it means you may miss a run-up on that stock. You might also be able to buy back in later to that stock cheaper, no one can predict the future so I say just don't time it, sell the crap and invest back into winners.What are you looking for here? There's no way to make your money back instantly, selling a winner is not advised unless you need the cash, and a loss on a stock is part of the risk of picking stocks.",2,0.571,1.0,NEGATIVE
