What do the others need to do to take away NVIDIAs dominance ?","The problem with Nvidia is the same problem you get in every single market: high volumes and high margins attract competition and investment. But worse, because you're in tech and you're only as good as your latest products. Companies very often get complacent when they are market leaders (see Oracle, IBM, Intel recently).AMD was never lured to fight much Nvidia on the peanuts of the gaming market, they never made any money on pc GPU, but this may change with AI. Intel too has recently started competing.Point is: what really matters to customers of those GPUs eventually is how much computing power they get for their money. There's different models and different software out there.Anybody expecting Nvidia to dominate without a competition for a decade clearly does not understand the complexity of long term dominance in tech which is very hard to obtain and maintain.",0,0.547,1.0,NEGATIVE
