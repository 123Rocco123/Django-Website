,There was earlier discussion pre covid that this could be the next Tesla or Amd ? Is there no mass appeal for consumers to buy Lucid vehicles or is it because they heavily rely on the Middle East Royalty to keep funding them and don’t have a visionary ceo like Elon to carry it through its current slump ?,"I mean right now the financials look terrible and I don’t know about any major catalyst that will change that. The ev market got crowded, even Ford is having to sharply discount their new trucks to stay competitive.So you tell us, what’s the upside for lucid?",0,0.534,1.0,NEGATIVE

Is there no mass appeal for consumers to buy Lucid vehicles or is it because they heavily rely on the Middle East Royalty to keep funding them and don’t have a visionary ceo like Elon to carry it through its current slump ?,"All true and good points about early Tesla predictions. But, the EV market has changed significantly since Tesla came on the scene. Tesla almost lost it all more than once and they have had first mover advantage, huge cash injections, and the tech to back it up. The question is, does Lucid have all that it takes plus more to compete in today's EV market? As an example, Rolls Royce just announced the new Spectre all EV. If Lucid thinks it's a luxury car, Rolls Royce pulled up and slapped them into reality.",2,0.533,0.995,NEGATIVE

Is there no mass appeal for consumers to buy Lucid vehicles or is it because they heavily rely on the Middle East Royalty to keep funding them and don’t have a visionary ceo like Elon to carry it through its current slump ?,"But why would anyone in the upper class get a Lucid vehicle over an Audi, Mercedes, BMW, or Porsche EV? All of the aforementioned brands have bigger brand recognition? Also, why would you get a Lucid vehicle over Model S, again a model and brnd that is more recognizable which is exactly what upper class individuals want.",2,0.516,0.981,NEGATIVE

They don't say the model on them, so they're all the same to me. Model 3? Model S? Who the hell knows. It's definitely a knock against the model S as a status symbol.",3,0.502,0.685,NEGATIVE

But if you can't then that's ok, hopefully for Tesla's sake other's are able to differentiate between the two.",6,0.516,0.996,NEGATIVE

Is there no mass appeal for consumers to buy Lucid vehicles or is it because they heavily rely on the Middle East Royalty to keep funding them and don’t have a visionary ceo like Elon to carry it through its current slump ?,"Well that’s the theory, but the problem is right now they aren’t selling nearly enough cars to cover their costs. So what’s going to change that? Why will the rich suddenly decide they want a lucid as opposed to a rolls, Bentley, Ferrari, Lamborghini etc?",2,0.508,0.984,NEGATIVE

Is there no mass appeal for consumers to buy Lucid vehicles or is it because they heavily rely on the Middle East Royalty to keep funding them and don’t have a visionary ceo like Elon to carry it through its current slump ?,"All of them either have or set a date for evs. There’s also the question of what makes you so sure the rich want evs? Again, numbers speak for themselves. Lucid isn’t selling many cars, so if there truly is such a demand for high end ev, what aren’t they capturing it",4,0.519,0.545,NEGATIVE

Seems you don’t really understand the needs and wants of rich people? Further, let’s put it this way: Tesla’s Model S outsells all of the luxury sedan options from its competitors, and it is nowhere near enough business to come remotely close to justifying Tesla’s valuation. Tesla could stop producing the Model S and X tomorrow and simply keep going about the rest of its business just fine. You expect a company that sells 10% the volume of just the Model S to be considered in the same league or a threat to Tesla? Surely this is a joke post?",2,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE

Is there no mass appeal for consumers to buy Lucid vehicles or is it because they heavily rely on the Middle East Royalty to keep funding them and don’t have a visionary ceo like Elon to carry it through its current slump ?,The rolex comparison is a poor attempt at making your point. Rolex has a rich heritage and immense brand value to the point where the demand for their watches is such that they are classified as a veblen good. You have people lining up to drop thousands on entry level models to build a relationship with their AD so that they can get a chance in the near future to access the watches they really want.You cannot say the same for Lucid.,2,0.51,1.0,NEGATIVE

Not in quality obviously, rolex's are very well made but in target demographic. The 'wannabes', shall we say. Not rich but want to seem rich.Personally I don't get expensive watches, at all. Carrying 20k+ held on by a little clasp on your wrist, just waiting to be snatched or dropped, they require annual expensive servicing like cars too, nope.",2,0.507,1.0,NEGATIVE

Look at warren buffets or bill gates car. Only middle class people pretending to be rich buy luxury goods and they get the most loud things so I doubt they would pick Lucid. They would want the Gucci of cars like the i8 electric bmw,2,0.513,1.0,NEGATIVE

Does catering to a small subsection work?Rolex a rich person/collector might also own many. There's markets for selling/collecting.

They actually make money too! Go for PSNY and RIVN for small ev everything else is a big risk. Rivian is backed by Amazon they have I believe around a 11% stake in Rivian.
