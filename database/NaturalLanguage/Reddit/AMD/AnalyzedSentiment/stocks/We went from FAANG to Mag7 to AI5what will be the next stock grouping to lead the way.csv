I have purchased shares every single month since that time. (Full disclosure, in my job when I get big checks i buy significantly more in certain months) but I stay consistent, reinvested the dividend and, as I previously said, 17 years later, it’s been a big hit for me. I should note it was SCARY as hell when the financial crisis came but my father told me to stick it out and buy more when everyone was selling. Subsequently, I was fortunate enough to get a purchase of nearly 500 shares for $95 and some change in, bizarrely, May of 2009 as I recall. From there it was really a straight shot (more or less) until the pandemic and, when the stock market got drilled, I didnt panic, I did the same thing I did in 09’ I bought heavier.Real simple process, mindless to be honest, but it works and, while you’re not going to get the sexy 1000% returns in 10 years, a solid 7-10% annual return is more than enough for me to be happy and certainly adds up.

Rocket Lab was the reason I started investing in stocks, as I believe in huge upside potential of anything related to space - a market that is emerging right now, dominated by a handful of rapidly diversifying/growing companies.However, I think it'll take a few years until the sector js a viable investment opportunity. SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and Blue Origin are shaping up to dominate the market for the forseeable future, with SpaceX soon printing money with Starlink. But it will take some time, qnd better launch capabilities, to have a proper space-based economy.However with Starship, New Glenn, and Neuron, which focus on larger payloads, high launch cadence, and low costs, a recruitment effect may be around the corner. Build it, and they will come.",1,0.536,0.999,NEGATIVE
