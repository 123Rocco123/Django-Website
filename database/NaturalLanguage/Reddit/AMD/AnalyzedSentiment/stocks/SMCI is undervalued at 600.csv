,"SMCI’s Quarterly revenue was $3.66 billion, P/E ratio - 41.38, Mkt. Cap - 32.41 billion. Their guidance says their annual revenue for 2024 will be around 14-15 billion. Profitability looks good, free cash flow around $450 million. Their server racks are the fastest to hit the market and they have reasonable moat, good relations with nvidia, AMD, Microsoft, and Meta. Now let’s take a look at some other stocks, AMD’s revenue is around $6.5 billion latest quarter, and market cap is around $275.38 billion, FCF - 1 billion. Sure AMD and super micro are not in the same league but they will both benefit equally from AI boom and are operating under nvidia’s shadows. Their operating income and net incomes are comparable too. And yet SMCI is over 8 times undervalued than AMD. I don’t even hold SMCI and don’t plan on buying it at current levels. Am I missing something?","Not an expert here but revenue is misleading when you're comparing companies with wildly different margins.Looking at their most recent 10Q, their gross margins are 15%. Profit margin is 8%. I'm assuming SMCI is currently in their good macro days.I can see that just years ago their profit margin was 2%. They were founded in 1993 so that profit margin would already be maximized and not startup margins.Assuming 8% profit margins going forward, if they were worth $275bn and let's assume a 25 PE ratio which is lower than SP500 average, they would need revenues of $137.5bn.I do not know how much market share they currently have and what's their TAM, but the $15bn for 2024 is a LONG way from $137.5bn. If their market share is already dominant and TAM is limited, then it's impossible to get there without entering new markets.The coverage of big tech companies sometimes makes one lose perspective on how hard even $300bn market cap is to achieve. AMD is the 15th largest *tech company in the world, and they haven't grown profits into their valuation yet.In summary, using AMD's valuation as a comparable for a company in a different industry with wildly different margins (50% vs 15%) then comparing revenue, will only lead you to erroneous conclusions.Try to figure out what SMCI's future growth looks like. I see analyst forecasts put revenue above 20bn a couple of years out, and gross margins improving to 17%, so it may indeed be undervalued, but it won't have anything to do with AMD.",0,0.559,1.0,NEGATIVE

Am I missing something?","If you're comparing mid term outlooks (like 1-2 years) then SMCI is super undervalued. The ai boon is very real and every single time people laughed at NVDA shooting to the moon, it went up again. It was multiple hundred billion dollar company growing like a startup. This isn't just a couple quarters of amazing revenue. It's first mover into potentially a transformative and revolutionary computing paradigm. Tech giants are willing to pay out the ass for this stuff.The reason SMCI was operating on slim margins was b/c they competed in a saturated market of giants like IBM, HP, dell, etc. making classic server architecture. And they were a fine business that made good shit. But AI chips demand a unique scaffold. And apparently SMCI's is the best, especially for NVDA chips. So in the mid term, they are gonna rocket. This is especially true if the rest of the S&P remains stagnant.Longer term (5+ years) is more uncertain. If they can expand capacity quickly, that portends favorable things. But ultimately, they need AI to deliver real computing gains and tech revolutions. But now during its infancy, we can't know what that future brings. So you should ride the momentum until competitors show up or AI starts to underdeliver.",1,0.535,0.959,NEGATIVE
