,"I think there is something to a 3d arrangement of wires vs 2d where gravity, pressure, and joint 3d electron forces come together with clock speed fluctuations to produce electron adeterminism. The consequence is micro noise in the system. Additional theory: Memory of past state is fundamentally different at different pressures. Evidence: Take a look at a comparison between the ryzen 7 5700x (no 3d) and ryzen 7 5800x3d (with 3d) and note in a period of lower frames, note 41 vs 29 .1% FPS https://i.imgur.com/K6zvFZ3.jpg .1% FPS is important to perceived fluidity and may speak to/coordinate with frame time as well.  And consider the fact Intel is not rushing to this technology, despite having access to TSMC which has 3d cache capacity ",Just look at the benchmarks. They proove the 3d memory works and performs better.AMD and TSMC have the tightest cooperation. Intel is ebcomjng a competitor.,0,0.551,0.93,NEGATIVE

Actually fuck that. It's straight up a missreprsetion of facts. Furthermore 3d v-cashes optimal use case isn't even on the client side but on the server.You're just wrong, don't know what you're talking about, everybody who read your post have lost brain cells.",0,0.507,1.0,NEGATIVE

Not about valuation. How did you even jump to that conclusion.,2,0.552,1.0,NEGATIVE
