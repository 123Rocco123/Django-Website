,"Let me give you the lowdown on what’s going on with AMD and how I'm playing it. Current Play: So, AMD's been moving—up 0.8% on Friday, to be exact. It hit a high of $169.45 and settled at $168.16. But here’s the kicker: only 14.5 million shares traded hands, way below the usual 66.8 million. That’s a 78% drop in volume! Something’s brewing. Analyst Chatter: The street’s buzzing. Here’s the breakdown: Citigroup: Slashed their target from $192 to $176, still says “buy.” Morgan Stanley: Cut theirs from $193 to $177, also keeps an “overweight” rating. KeyCorp: Dropped from $270 to $230, sticking with “overweight.” DZ Bank: Upped to a “buy” with a $190 target. Wedbush: Stays “outperform” with a $200 target. Overall, it’s a solid “Moderate Buy” from 28 out of 31 analysts, with an average target of $185.26. They’re mostly bullish, with a couple of cautious voices in the mix. Financial Pulse: Earnings came in at $0.62 per share, just a hair above the consensus of $0.61. Revenue’s at $5.47 billion, a tiny miss against the $5.48 billion estimate but up 2.2% year-over-year. Not earth-shattering, but steady. Key ratios to watch: Debt-to-equity: 0.03. Quick ratio: 1.92. Current ratio: 2.64. Market cap sits at $271.33 billion, with a P/E ratio of 246.87. The PEG ratio is 1.92, and it’s got a beta of 1.69, so it’s got some juice in a volatile market. Insider Moves: Now, insiders are moving. CEO Lisa Su unloaded 125,000 shares for about $24.4 million, and EVP Mark Papermaster sold 16,200 shares for around $2.7 million. Total insider sales in the past three months hit about $30.1 million. They still hold 0.73% of the stock. Could be normal cashing out, but always worth noting. Institutional Maneuvers: Big players are piling in: Norges Bank: Dropped $3.4 billion into AMD. DZ BANK AG: Boosted their stake by over 800%. International Assets Investment Management LLC and Capital World Investors: Both made hefty buys, each around half a billion. Price T Rowe Associates Inc.: Upped their game, now holding $4.08 billion worth. My Strategy: Technical Setup: 50-Day Moving Average: $161.33. 200-Day Moving Average: $161.36. Key levels to watch: the previous close at $166.78 and the moving averages. Entry Points: Short-Term: I’m eyeing a dip around $165. That’s close to the 50-day moving average and looks like a sweet spot for a bounce. Long-Term: If it slides to the 200-day moving average ($161.36) or even below, it’s time to load up. Exit Strategy: Short-Term Gains: I’m looking to cash out around $176 to $177, right in line with Citigroup and Morgan Stanley’s targets. Quick win. Long-Term Hold: Eyeing around $200, where Wedbush’s target lies. That’s a juicy exit if it runs up there. Market Conditions: Keep an ear to the ground for earnings and industry news. The semiconductor space can flip on a dime with supply chain issues or new tech breakthroughs. The Bottom Line: AMD’s got some strong fundamentals and analyst support, despite some recent target cuts. It’s a play worth considering, with a potential sweet spot for entry at $165 and a target exit anywhere between $176 and $200. Stay sharp, and let’s see how this ride goes!

Hell Intel is trying to get into gpus with a huge history of chip design and their ARC gpus are really struggling to get anything but the lowest end business.",5,0.563,0.981,POSITIVE
,"Let me give you the lowdown on what’s going on with AMD and how I'm playing it. Current Play: So, AMD's been moving—up 0.8% on Friday, to be exact. It hit a high of $169.45 and settled at $168.16. But here’s the kicker: only 14.5 million shares traded hands, way below the usual 66.8 million. That’s a 78% drop in volume! Something’s brewing. Analyst Chatter: The street’s buzzing. Here’s the breakdown: Citigroup: Slashed their target from $192 to $176, still says “buy.” Morgan Stanley: Cut theirs from $193 to $177, also keeps an “overweight” rating. KeyCorp: Dropped from $270 to $230, sticking with “overweight.” DZ Bank: Upped to a “buy” with a $190 target. Wedbush: Stays “outperform” with a $200 target. Overall, it’s a solid “Moderate Buy” from 28 out of 31 analysts, with an average target of $185.26. They’re mostly bullish, with a couple of cautious voices in the mix. Financial Pulse: Earnings came in at $0.62 per share, just a hair above the consensus of $0.61. Revenue’s at $5.47 billion, a tiny miss against the $5.48 billion estimate but up 2.2% year-over-year. Not earth-shattering, but steady. Key ratios to watch: Debt-to-equity: 0.03. Quick ratio: 1.92. Current ratio: 2.64. Market cap sits at $271.33 billion, with a P/E ratio of 246.87. The PEG ratio is 1.92, and it’s got a beta of 1.69, so it’s got some juice in a volatile market. Insider Moves: Now, insiders are moving. CEO Lisa Su unloaded 125,000 shares for about $24.4 million, and EVP Mark Papermaster sold 16,200 shares for around $2.7 million. Total insider sales in the past three months hit about $30.1 million. They still hold 0.73% of the stock. Could be normal cashing out, but always worth noting. Institutional Maneuvers: Big players are piling in: Norges Bank: Dropped $3.4 billion into AMD. DZ BANK AG: Boosted their stake by over 800%. International Assets Investment Management LLC and Capital World Investors: Both made hefty buys, each around half a billion. Price T Rowe Associates Inc.: Upped their game, now holding $4.08 billion worth. My Strategy: Technical Setup: 50-Day Moving Average: $161.33. 200-Day Moving Average: $161.36. Key levels to watch: the previous close at $166.78 and the moving averages. Entry Points: Short-Term: I’m eyeing a dip around $165. That’s close to the 50-day moving average and looks like a sweet spot for a bounce. Long-Term: If it slides to the 200-day moving average ($161.36) or even below, it’s time to load up. Exit Strategy: Short-Term Gains: I’m looking to cash out around $176 to $177, right in line with Citigroup and Morgan Stanley’s targets. Quick win. Long-Term Hold: Eyeing around $200, where Wedbush’s target lies. That’s a juicy exit if it runs up there. Market Conditions: Keep an ear to the ground for earnings and industry news. The semiconductor space can flip on a dime with supply chain issues or new tech breakthroughs. The Bottom Line: AMD’s got some strong fundamentals and analyst support, despite some recent target cuts. It’s a play worth considering, with a potential sweet spot for entry at $165 and a target exit anywhere between $176 and $200. Stay sharp, and let’s see how this ride goes! Cheers to smart trading! 🥂","In a few years the hardware will surpass what people need and AMD will be in perfect position to sell cheaper chips that are still way more advanced than what anyone has todayI get your point, and it's a smart prediction. I wonder though, by the time that shift takes place if we're not in a landscape where the big dogs that have already fleshed out huge AI data centres are providing AI as a service1, meaning there may never be a ""cottage"" or low-cost AI hardware market. As an example, there isn't really a cottage cloud service space - it's dominated by the companies that built out gigantic facilities over the last several years like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.No one can predict the future - it's going to be an interesting ride, for sure.1 I like the name ""TaaS"", or Tokens as a Service for this kind of AI subscription offering.",6,0.546,0.998,POSITIVE

But here’s the kicker: only 14.5 million shares traded hands, way below the usual 66.8 million. That’s a 78% drop in volume! Something’s brewing. Analyst Chatter: The street’s buzzing. Here’s the breakdown: Citigroup: Slashed their target from $192 to $176, still says “buy.” Morgan Stanley: Cut theirs from $193 to $177, also keeps an “overweight” rating. KeyCorp: Dropped from $270 to $230, sticking with “overweight.” DZ Bank: Upped to a “buy” with a $190 target. Wedbush: Stays “outperform” with a $200 target. Overall, it’s a solid “Moderate Buy” from 28 out of 31 analysts, with an average target of $185.26. They’re mostly bullish, with a couple of cautious voices in the mix. Financial Pulse: Earnings came in at $0.62 per share, just a hair above the consensus of $0.61. Revenue’s at $5.47 billion, a tiny miss against the $5.48 billion estimate but up 2.2% year-over-year.

KeyCorp: Dropped from $270 to $230, sticking with “overweight.” DZ Bank: Upped to a “buy” with a $190 target. Wedbush: Stays “outperform” with a $200 target. Overall, it’s a solid “Moderate Buy” from 28 out of 31 analysts, with an average target of $185.26. They’re mostly bullish, with a couple of cautious voices in the mix. Financial Pulse: Earnings came in at $0.62 per share, just a hair above the consensus of $0.61. Revenue’s at $5.47 billion, a tiny miss against the $5.48 billion estimate but up 2.2% year-over-year. Not earth-shattering, but steady. Key ratios to watch: Debt-to-equity: 0.03. Quick ratio: 1.92. Current ratio: 2.64. Market cap sits at $271.33 billion, with a P/E ratio of 246.87.

They still hold 0.73% of the stock. Could be normal cashing out, but always worth noting. Institutional Maneuvers: Big players are piling in: Norges Bank: Dropped $3.4 billion into AMD. DZ BANK AG: Boosted their stake by over 800%. International Assets Investment Management LLC and Capital World Investors: Both made hefty buys, each around half a billion. Price T Rowe Associates Inc.: Upped their game, now holding $4.08 billion worth. My Strategy: Technical Setup: 50-Day Moving Average: $161.33. 200-Day Moving Average: $161.36. Key levels to watch: the previous close at $166.78 and the moving averages. Entry Points: Short-Term: I’m eyeing a dip around $165. That’s close to the 50-day moving average and looks like a sweet spot for a bounce. Long-Term: If it slides to the 200-day moving average ($161.36) or even below, it’s time to load up.

,"Let me give you the lowdown on what’s going on with AMD and how I'm playing it. Current Play: So, AMD's been moving—up 0.8% on Friday, to be exact. It hit a high of $169.45 and settled at $168.16. But here’s the kicker: only 14.5 million shares traded hands, way below the usual 66.8 million. That’s a 78% drop in volume! Something’s brewing. Analyst Chatter: The street’s buzzing. Here’s the breakdown: Citigroup: Slashed their target from $192 to $176, still says “buy.” Morgan Stanley: Cut theirs from $193 to $177, also keeps an “overweight” rating. KeyCorp: Dropped from $270 to $230, sticking with “overweight.” DZ Bank: Upped to a “buy” with a $190 target. Wedbush: Stays “outperform” with a $200 target. Overall, it’s a solid “Moderate Buy” from 28 out of 31 analysts, with an average target of $185.26. They’re mostly bullish, with a couple of cautious voices in the mix. Financial Pulse: Earnings came in at $0.62 per share, just a hair above the consensus of $0.61. Revenue’s at $5.47 billion, a tiny miss against the $5.48 billion estimate but up 2.2% year-over-year. Not earth-shattering, but steady. Key ratios to watch: Debt-to-equity: 0.03. Quick ratio: 1.92. Current ratio: 2.64. Market cap sits at $271.33 billion, with a P/E ratio of 246.87. The PEG ratio is 1.92, and it’s got a beta of 1.69, so it’s got some juice in a volatile market. Insider Moves: Now, insiders are moving.

That’s close to the 50-day moving average and looks like a sweet spot for a bounce. Long-Term: If it slides to the 200-day moving average ($161.36) or even below, it’s time to load up.

Overall, it’s a solid “Moderate Buy” from 28 out of 31 analysts, with an average target of $185.26. They’re mostly bullish, with a couple of cautious voices in the mix. Financial Pulse: Earnings came in at $0.62 per share, just a hair above the consensus of $0.61. Revenue’s at $5.47 billion, a tiny miss against the $5.48 billion estimate but up 2.2% year-over-year. Not earth-shattering, but steady. Key ratios to watch: Debt-to-equity: 0.03. Quick ratio: 1.92. Current ratio: 2.64. Market cap sits at $271.33 billion, with a P/E ratio of 246.87. The PEG ratio is 1.92, and it’s got a beta of 1.69, so it’s got some juice in a volatile market. Insider Moves: Now, insiders are moving. CEO Lisa Su unloaded 125,000 shares for about $24.4 million, and EVP Mark Papermaster sold 16,200 shares for around $2.7 million. Total insider sales in the past three months hit about $30.1 million. They still hold 0.73% of the stock. Could be normal cashing out, but always worth noting. Institutional Maneuvers: Big players are piling in: Norges Bank: Dropped $3.4 billion into AMD. DZ BANK AG: Boosted their stake by over 800%. International Assets Investment Management LLC and Capital World Investors: Both made hefty buys, each around half a billion. Price T Rowe Associates Inc.: Upped their game, now holding $4.08 billion worth. My Strategy: Technical Setup: 50-Day Moving Average: $161.33. 200-Day Moving Average: $161.36. Key levels to watch: the previous close at $166.78 and the moving averages. Entry Points: Short-Term: I’m eyeing a dip around $165. That’s close to the 50-day moving average and looks like a sweet spot for a bounce. Long-Term: If it slides to the 200-day moving average ($161.36) or even below, it’s time to load up. Exit Strategy: Short-Term Gains: I’m looking to cash out around $176 to $177, right in line with Citigroup and Morgan Stanley’s targets. Quick win. Long-Term Hold: Eyeing around $200, where Wedbush’s target lies. That’s a juicy exit if it runs up there. Market Conditions: Keep an ear to the ground for earnings and industry news.

,"Let me give you the lowdown on what’s going on with AMD and how I'm playing it. Current Play: So, AMD's been moving—up 0.8% on Friday, to be exact. It hit a high of $169.45 and settled at $168.16. But here’s the kicker: only 14.5 million shares traded hands, way below the usual 66.8 million. That’s a 78% drop in volume! Something’s brewing. Analyst Chatter: The street’s buzzing. Here’s the breakdown: Citigroup: Slashed their target from $192 to $176, still says “buy.” Morgan Stanley: Cut theirs from $193 to $177, also keeps an “overweight” rating. KeyCorp: Dropped from $270 to $230, sticking with “overweight.” DZ Bank: Upped to a “buy” with a $190 target. Wedbush: Stays “outperform” with a $200 target. Overall, it’s a solid “Moderate Buy” from 28 out of 31 analysts, with an average target of $185.26. They’re mostly bullish, with a couple of cautious voices in the mix. Financial Pulse: Earnings came in at $0.62 per share, just a hair above the consensus of $0.61. Revenue’s at $5.47 billion, a tiny miss against the $5.48 billion estimate but up 2.2% year-over-year. Not earth-shattering, but steady. Key ratios to watch: Debt-to-equity: 0.03. Quick ratio: 1.92. Current ratio: 2.64. Market cap sits at $271.33 billion, with a P/E ratio of 246.87. The PEG ratio is 1.92, and it’s got a beta of 1.69, so it’s got some juice in a volatile market. Insider Moves: Now, insiders are moving. CEO Lisa Su unloaded 125,000 shares for about $24.4 million, and EVP Mark Papermaster sold 16,200 shares for around $2.7 million. Total insider sales in the past three months hit about $30.1 million. They still hold 0.73% of the stock. Could be normal cashing out, but always worth noting. Institutional Maneuvers: Big players are piling in: Norges Bank: Dropped $3.4 billion into AMD. DZ BANK AG: Boosted their stake by over 800%. International Assets Investment Management LLC and Capital World Investors: Both made hefty buys, each around half a billion. Price T Rowe Associates Inc.: Upped their game, now holding $4.08 billion worth. My Strategy: Technical Setup: 50-Day Moving Average: $161.33. 200-Day Moving Average: $161.36. Key levels to watch: the previous close at $166.78 and the moving averages. Entry Points: Short-Term: I’m eyeing a dip around $165. That’s close to the 50-day moving average and looks like a sweet spot for a bounce. Long-Term: If it slides to the 200-day moving average ($161.36) or even below, it’s time to load up.

,"Let me give you the lowdown on what’s going on with AMD and how I'm playing it. Current Play: So, AMD's been moving—up 0.8% on Friday, to be exact. It hit a high of $169.45 and settled at $168.16. But here’s the kicker: only 14.5 million shares traded hands, way below the usual 66.8 million. That’s a 78% drop in volume! Something’s brewing. Analyst Chatter: The street’s buzzing. Here’s the breakdown: Citigroup: Slashed their target from $192 to $176, still says “buy.” Morgan Stanley: Cut theirs from $193 to $177, also keeps an “overweight” rating. KeyCorp: Dropped from $270 to $230, sticking with “overweight.” DZ Bank: Upped to a “buy” with a $190 target. Wedbush: Stays “outperform” with a $200 target. Overall, it’s a solid “Moderate Buy” from 28 out of 31 analysts, with an average target of $185.26. They’re mostly bullish, with a couple of cautious voices in the mix. Financial Pulse: Earnings came in at $0.62 per share, just a hair above the consensus of $0.61. Revenue’s at $5.47 billion, a tiny miss against the $5.48 billion estimate but up 2.2% year-over-year. Not earth-shattering, but steady. Key ratios to watch: Debt-to-equity: 0.03. Quick ratio: 1.92. Current ratio: 2.64. Market cap sits at $271.33 billion, with a P/E ratio of 246.87. The PEG ratio is 1.92, and it’s got a beta of 1.69, so it’s got some juice in a volatile market. Insider Moves: Now, insiders are moving. CEO Lisa Su unloaded 125,000 shares for about $24.4 million, and EVP Mark Papermaster sold 16,200 shares for around $2.7 million. Total insider sales in the past three months hit about $30.1 million. They still hold 0.73% of the stock. Could be normal cashing out, but always worth noting. Institutional Maneuvers: Big players are piling in: Norges Bank: Dropped $3.4 billion into AMD.

CEO Lisa Su unloaded 125,000 shares for about $24.4 million, and EVP Mark Papermaster sold 16,200 shares for around $2.7 million. Total insider sales in the past three months hit about $30.1 million. They still hold 0.73% of the stock. Could be normal cashing out, but always worth noting. Institutional Maneuvers: Big players are piling in: Norges Bank: Dropped $3.4 billion into AMD. DZ BANK AG: Boosted their stake by over 800%. International Assets Investment Management LLC and Capital World Investors: Both made hefty buys, each around half a billion. Price T Rowe Associates Inc.: Upped their game, now holding $4.08 billion worth. My Strategy: Technical Setup: 50-Day Moving Average: $161.33. 200-Day Moving Average: $161.36. Key levels to watch: the previous close at $166.78 and the moving averages. Entry Points: Short-Term: I’m eyeing a dip around $165. That’s close to the 50-day moving average and looks like a sweet spot for a bounce. Long-Term: If it slides to the 200-day moving average ($161.36) or even below, it’s time to load up. Exit Strategy: Short-Term Gains: I’m looking to cash out around $176 to $177, right in line with Citigroup and Morgan Stanley’s targets. Quick win. Long-Term Hold: Eyeing around $200, where Wedbush’s target lies. That’s a juicy exit if it runs up there. Market Conditions: Keep an ear to the ground for earnings and industry news. The semiconductor space can flip on a dime with supply chain issues or new tech breakthroughs. The Bottom Line: AMD’s got some strong fundamentals and analyst support, despite some recent target cuts. It’s a play worth considering, with a potential sweet spot for entry at $165 and a target exit anywhere between $176 and $200. Stay sharp, and let’s see how this ride goes! Cheers to smart trading! 🥂","It's ridiculous PE was due to Xilinx aquisition. Plus, try to study their cash flow and read their roadmap, you'd be enlightened :)Its not a short term stock, people who invested AMD is for long term. Their growth is not crazy like Nvidia, but more safe and steady. Still have lots of potential. They are also trying to expand market beyond gaming.",3,0.563,0.999,NEGATIVE
,"Let me give you the lowdown on what’s going on with AMD and how I'm playing it. Current Play: So, AMD's been moving—up 0.8% on Friday, to be exact. It hit a high of $169.45 and settled at $168.16. But here’s the kicker: only 14.5 million shares traded hands, way below the usual 66.8 million. That’s a 78% drop in volume! Something’s brewing. Analyst Chatter: The street’s buzzing. Here’s the breakdown: Citigroup: Slashed their target from $192 to $176, still says “buy.” Morgan Stanley: Cut theirs from $193 to $177, also keeps an “overweight” rating. KeyCorp: Dropped from $270 to $230, sticking with “overweight.” DZ Bank: Upped to a “buy” with a $190 target. Wedbush: Stays “outperform” with a $200 target. Overall, it’s a solid “Moderate Buy” from 28 out of 31 analysts, with an average target of $185.26. They’re mostly bullish, with a couple of cautious voices in the mix. Financial Pulse: Earnings came in at $0.62 per share, just a hair above the consensus of $0.61. Revenue’s at $5.47 billion, a tiny miss against the $5.48 billion estimate but up 2.2% year-over-year.
