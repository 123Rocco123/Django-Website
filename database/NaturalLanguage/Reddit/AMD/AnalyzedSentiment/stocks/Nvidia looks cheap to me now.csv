They own 80% of the market for AI chips which is impressive for a company that used to only make graphics cards. It is also a market leader in data centers where they take more and more market share from competitors every quarter. They've diversified away from being a one trick pony with graphics cards and their recent partnership with Amazon sets them up for huge business/revenue increases for the foreseeable future.,1,0.59,0.984,POSITIVE

I am wondering what you guys think.","I still think looking at the fundamentals is key to any good investment strategy. NVidia has pretty solid fundamentals. It used to just make graphics cards and when that was the core of their business, it was pretty susceptible to swings in the market as those were largely considered luxury items. They lost over half their market value during the crypto mining fiasco in, I think, 2017-2018 ish. I started to buy heavily around that time and have held through a lot of ups and downs. I bought in small chunks and held through the split and am up like 700% from my initial investment in 2017. NVidia is now much more diversified as a market leader in data centers and a host of other things. They own something like 80% of the market for AI chips and while other companies like AMD, Microsoft, Intel, etc. are getting into the AI chip game, they are way behind the power curve. If you think AI is the next dot com bubble then you should probably avoid NVidia like the plague. For me, I trust companies to be as greedy as possible and always seek a competitive advantage, and AI helps them do just that. My primary concerns with NVidia are that they have significantly beat earnings expectations 3 or 4 quarters in a row now but in the last two quarters the stock has not really generated significant break outs from the previous quarter like we've come to expect with companies like Tesla (which had a P/E of 1396 at it's highest by the way). If they do not continue to significantly beat projections, or even miss, the stock price is going to suffer greatly. Recent policy decisions by the Biden administration cuts China off from purchasing their AI chips. For now they have a back log of customers they can shift to but they've already invested in tripling their manufacturing capability so once that comes online if they don't have a host of new customers, the chip glut will crash the price of the chips. They are also highly reliant on Taiwan manufacturing and China has openly stated their goal of forced reunification of Taiwan within the next few years. I'm going to be looking for an exit point in the next 6 months to a year once my capital gains tax threshold is met.",0,0.554,1.0,NEGATIVE
