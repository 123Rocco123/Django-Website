If you are truly bearish you should either sell the stock and/or buy puts/protective puts.With covered calls your risk is missing out on a theoretical infinite upside and your reward is capped at whatever you sold the contracts for.

Sell covered calls?",In my opinion anf given what you say about your history with the stock and future goals I think a definitive move one way or another is better rather then creating a small amount of cash flow at the cost of having your shares called away and missing the next run or even never getting back in.I only use covered calls with stocks I don't love long term. If I'm okay losing it or want to trim the position I sell calls. My 3 best plays last year involved this strategy but there are plenty of positions I own where I would never consider covered calls.If I misread and you want to thin your position then I think it's okay but I don't like it as a hedge.,2,0.546,1.0,NEGATIVE

Since you hold AMD I have a feeling you like a little more aggressive investing I would lean more towards SMH checkout their holdings they have NVIDIA, TSMC, AMD, ASML and various other semiconductor companies.Maybe instead of buying just AMD maybe moving forward start buying a bit of SMH or skim off some AMD stock and move it to SMH up to you.",0,0.569,1.0,NEGATIVE

For example, you might say 20% is too high to invest in a single stock and you will trim between 20% and 25% using covered calls. Above 25% it is way too high and you will trim down to that level by selling shares down to 25%.Up to you want your thresholds are. Could be 25% could be be 50%.",0,0.53,0.999,NEGATIVE
