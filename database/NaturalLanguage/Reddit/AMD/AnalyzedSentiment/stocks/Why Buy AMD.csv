AMD will never be as profitable as NVDA like you mentioned they don't have the same products, skill and resource to compete. But NVDA is notorious for jumping on threads for example crypto mining and now AI. Whereas AMD is more quiet and doing it's thing in the background. To me I like the quiet nature of AMD, plus Su has done a great job and the leadership is solid. This is where I fell in love with AMD, they did an amazing job bring the company back to relevance and beating out Intel. This was their closet competition and they finally beat them out. They will not hold a touch light to NVDA because they don't operate and feed on hype. Now the cost of entry is another point, NVDA is higher than AMD, and looking at both business models I felt AMD was a solid option. Don't get me wrong NVDA is the better company, I just don't like when they get on hype train and pump their stocks. In the end NVDA will always dictate the market and sentiment for AMD. So I say why not have both. With AI, I know NVDA will milk the hell out of this hype, I have no doubt about that. When it comes to PC, AMD has done a good job caving out a market for themselves, so although you go for the recognizable brand, AMD positions themselves to be the option for every other person and use case. This will be my final piece, let's say AI just died tomorrow and was not a thing, AMD will survive better than NVDA, because of their business model. AI dying probably won't happen but you get my pointPositions 20 shares @190 of NVDA(sold 10 to grab some profit during this run) 30 shares @110 of AMD",0,0.573,0.996,NEGATIVE
