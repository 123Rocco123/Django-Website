,"Let's summarize the reasons why INTC is at the current price: - Lagging behind in technology - Poor track record of management - In the middle of a pivotal moment in their history - Losing market share in most segments - Record low profits amid market saturation and supply chain issues - Their AI portfolio misses most of the AI golden rush - Alternative architecture ARM is customizable and this spiked in demand these days Still, let's underline some facts: Market valuation landscape: - Up in the value chain, the only competitor is AMD. AMD is 5 times smaller in size, yet has bigger market cap. And remember AMD outsources its fabs, with this info alone you can estimate that the apples-to-apples difference in valuation is 25-fold. - In the fab front, TSMC is valued 5 times higher than Intel. For reference it has 40% less employees. Strategy: Currently everything depends on whether INTC will pull out two moves successfully: - Transitioning to a third party fab model (partly becoming another TSMC) - Catching up to TSMC's tech They have plenty of resources to do that, however it will not be done overnight and the clock is ticking. Everything else (mobile processors, graphics cards, AI) is important and on the right track, but they are secondary and we shouldn't worry too much. Management: The CEO is the best they had in a decade by far. CEO is committed to the new strategy, and made INTC lead efforts in supply chain stability, which should not be understated, as this is of high strategic value for countries and partners alike. If they execute their strategy swiftly, they will be at least remotely comparable to their rivals in market valuation. If they hit several bumps, the current valuation would not seem overvalued. We already have positive things to say about their execution: - They secured preferential treatment from ASML for next gen litography ahead of what TSMC can do. - They approached the 10 biggest clients in the fab business and some already jumped in the bandwagon. Some, like NVIDIA, gave signs they are likely to join. - 25% of their Xeon are used for AI workloads and have competitive offers in graphics cards. - I noticed that the satisfaction regarding Intel-branded products has increased lately, due to competitors becoming greedy with their last successes. Irrational fears: - The fear that AMD will leave INTC in the dust due to the rapid growth of their market share: Hey, it's one thing to believe that catching up is gonna make the parity even, and it's a completely different thing to defend that AMD has some kind of superpower or INTC an unforgiveable defficiency that will lead to an uneven outcome over the long term. 50-50 seems natural. - Intel performance disappointed me / I had losses with this stock: Relatable, but it's not wise to make decisions on these terms. Ngl, this is a long game, but it doesn't look like a bad starting position, especially if we consider the already saturated alternatives. EDIT: Thank you for your points of view, they give me more to think about. After all, my goal is to make the most fair case and orient my thoughts, as I see no good or current publication about this.","Not sure if I find your arguments convincing---AMD outsourcing fabs is a ""negative"" for AMD. Disagree, consumers really don't care whether fabs are made in-house or outsourced. They only care about the performance & pricing of the chipsTSMC being valued 5x higher than INTC despite having half the staff. So they're much more efficient than INTC, not really a negative. TSMC just does 1 thing (fabs) while INTC has several business verticals.INTC play is a long shot. You are betting they can catch up to TSMC and the geopolitical risks with China result in many manufacturers (several of which actually compete with INTC) switch to INTC foundry.",0,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE

Intel has a massive history of success and brand recognition. It takes a lot more than some missteps in innovation to throw them in the trash.If they catch up even moderately, they are severely underpriced right now. Plus they are perfectly positioned to benefit from overseas geopolitical risks, like you said.

After that it will continue growing like it did in the previous years.Why we can assume this:Revenue took a dip in 2022/23 due to supply problems, inventory corrections and saturation of some markets. AMD gained a couple points of market share during this crisis only because they managed this problem slightly better than Intel. That is to say, the problem is not collapsing market share. Revenue kept growing all these years despite steadily losing market to AMD. If there was a halt in that trend, revenue growth could even go up.The recovery of this market is bound to happen by the end of 2024 (to 2020 levels).Costs:I expect costs to stagnate during the current year (production still below capacity, low growth, cost-saving measures), which is safe to say. After that, they will continue to grow at the same rate revenue does (above historical trend for extra safety).------Under these circumstances, Net income (excluding equity in affiliates) will be 17B at the end of next year, still below 2020 levels. Nonetheless, that's a forward PE ratio of 8 (and that's only on the business they've been running till now).Still, NI and Cash flow might take an additional year to fully recover due to new heavy expenditure in new plants and equipment and technology lag, but otherwise we have a solid track record of positive free cash flow that was briefly interrupted during this crisis.What you said about INTC not dominating the world is correct. I simply stated the current business is not overvalued, but if you buy it, you get free tickets to benefit from the evolution of their foundry business, which could be a game changer.",4,0.566,0.993,NEGATIVE

While they may not be overvalued they may make consistent 7-10% gains annually. But look at that opportunity cost compared to NVIDIA and AMD that had gained in the triple digits the past few years because they have ramped up their R&D. Markets are forward looking and investors will throw money into what’s hot.",0,0.554,0.999,NEGATIVE
,"Let's summarize the reasons why INTC is at the current price: - Lagging behind in technology - Poor track record of management - In the middle of a pivotal moment in their history - Losing market share in most segments - Record low profits amid market saturation and supply chain issues - Their AI portfolio misses most of the AI golden rush - Alternative architecture ARM is customizable and this spiked in demand these days Still, let's underline some facts: Market valuation landscape: - Up in the value chain, the only competitor is AMD. AMD is 5 times smaller in size, yet has bigger market cap. And remember AMD outsources its fabs, with this info alone you can estimate that the apples-to-apples difference in valuation is 25-fold. - In the fab front, TSMC is valued 5 times higher than Intel. For reference it has 40% less employees. Strategy: Currently everything depends on whether INTC will pull out two moves successfully: - Transitioning to a third party fab model (partly becoming another TSMC) - Catching up to TSMC's tech They have plenty of resources to do that, however it will not be done overnight and the clock is ticking. Everything else (mobile processors, graphics cards, AI) is important and on the right track, but they are secondary and we shouldn't worry too much. Management: The CEO is the best they had in a decade by far. CEO is committed to the new strategy, and made INTC lead efforts in supply chain stability, which should not be understated, as this is of high strategic value for countries and partners alike. If they execute their strategy swiftly, they will be at least remotely comparable to their rivals in market valuation. If they hit several bumps, the current valuation would not seem overvalued.
