,"Micron Technology Inc.’s stock dropped more than 6% after China’s cyberspace regulator said that its products failed to pass a cybersecurity review in the country. Beijing warned operators of key infrastructure against buying the company’s goods, saying it found “relatively serious” cybersecurity risks in Micron products sold in the country. The components caused “significant security risks to our critical information infrastructure supply chain,” which would affect national security, according to the statement from the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC.Micron’s shares dropped as much as 6.8% in premarket trading, which would be the biggest intraday fall since November if it holds during regular trading. The stock had gained 36% this year, closing at $68.17 on Friday. The CAC had said about six weeks ago that it was launching a security review of imports from Micron, the US’s last major memory chipmaker. The tech sector has become a key battlefield over national security between the two largest economies, with Washington having already blacklisted Chinese tech firms, cut off the flow of sophisticated processors and banned its citizens from providing certain help to the Chinese chip industry. In a statement, the US Commerce Department said Beijing’s conclusion had “no basis in fact” and Washington will continue to try and limit industry disruptions with its allies.

These are political actions pure and simple, and any business could be the next one to be made an example of.” The move brings fresh uncertainty to the other US chipmakers that sell to China, the world’s biggest market for semiconductors. Companies like Qualcomm Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Intel Corp. deliver billions of chips to the country, which puts the components inside electronic products that are shipped all over the world.

The company is assessing its next steps, adding that it looks forward “to continuing to engage in discussions with Chinese authorities.” Analysts at Jefferies including Edison Lee said in a research report that the CAC’s decision will likely have a small impact on Micron because it focuses on “critical information infrastructure,” meaning operations like data centers and cloud computing services with security risks.
