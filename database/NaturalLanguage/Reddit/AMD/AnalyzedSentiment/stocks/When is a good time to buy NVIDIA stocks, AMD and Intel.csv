Then compare the stocks and make up your own mind.My 2 cents is I'd say big US tech is overvalued right now due to AI hype. Even if it isn't massively overvalued, a correction is due. All I know for sure is when the markets are moving up or down at rapid pace is when I decide to stay out of it and just hold. There are quite specific times to sell and times to buy, but holding is always a good idea if the underlying company is able to turn a profit and has cash to burn through in case of an economic emergency. Interest rates are high so companies with not a lot of cash and big amounts of debt + high operating costs would be something I'd stay away from right now.There's an endless amount of counter arguments you could make though, so I'd recommend you learn at least the financial reports and then see what views you come up with yourself.

There are also equipment manufacturers like Lam Research, ASML and Applied Materials to look at. Intel and TSMC are the only two companies that can manufacture the latest logic / processor nodes. Samsung , Micron do memories. Big companies dominate as their fabs are extremely capital intensive investments and I believe there is space for all major player to co-exist. Intel recently has come up with some innovations in packaging etc that will help them regain some lost technological edge. Plus if they can get a big customer for foundry business, that will help them as well.

I can check the specifics of my models when I’m back on a terminal tomorrow though.I think it’s easier, or more realistic at least, to determine what sectors will do well in the short term, which makes it simpler to narrow down the list of companies I’m looking at. For instance, I’m bullish on energy & info tech atm, so I’ll determine subsectors of each I’m confident in (semis are one such subsector), then run a relative valuation of companies in that subsector. That RV model ranks the companies based on the weighted aforementioned factors (Liquidity, operating etc). Then I’ll do a deep dive on individual companies in the top quartile or so of that refined list and determine 12m price targets.So when I do the deep dive on each company I look at everything I can.

Last earnings, the stock sky rockets - this earnings the stock sky rocketed before the report and tanked after the report - which was one of the best reports the stock has ever had.I've traded AMD less than 10 times now - so I'm still learning the daily fluctuations of the stock.As far as Intel is concerned. I've been watching the stock daily.. but I haven't jumped in to trade it yet... because I feel am more comfortable trading Nvidia.I don't know what short term investing is to you - but you could just pick 1 of them. I would pick either Nvidia or Intel and just buy every payday for the next year.If you're looking to daily trade. You need 25k or you're stuck at only 3 trades a week.These stocks are volatile - so get used to seeing big drops and holding for a month or so.A couple months ago, I missed out on a 2.5% gain on Nvidia and watched it fall 8.55% going down to $400 a pop and growing back to over $500 a pop and sitting at $481 now.
