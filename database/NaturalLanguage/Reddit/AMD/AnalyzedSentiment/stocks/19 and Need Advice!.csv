Of course you can do that without one share just looking online, but I think you will find that if you like tech, you won't need SPY and the others (except the KO/VZ part) if you held XSD/XLK/QQQ.

Thank you guys!,"What you are doing is create your own ETF. There is nothing wrong with this strategy as long as you focus on those stocks and don’t expand them into a hundred, then you end up with a lot of little. Also I see some of your stocks pay dividends. Make sure you reinvest them. Finally, stay away from shady stocks like biopharma, they are very risky. You are young so build your portfolio and if you need to sell one stock over another do it but not because the stock is a short term loser. Think long term, example will VZ survive long term? It does pay great dividends but for the past several years has done nothing so although a stock like that may be good for an older investor looking for a steady dividend paying stock, at 19 it’s not a good thing, you don’t need dividends, you need growth. Also if you like a particular sector, get ETFs, and don’t shy away for an S&P ETF, or small caps, historically they have done well.",0,0.549,1.0,NEGATIVE
