One can only imagine how much DLC and other games they may have done had online not been such a cash cow. And that makes me curious how far they might have pushed the online features now that they are developing towards those long term goals.I'm sure that GTA6 will still launch with an epic story campaign because that's the hook, but I imagine it'll be designed to interconnect players with the online platform. I can't imagine Social Club and all that will stay as its outdated and poorly integrated form.I do also like it as a short play, because once the game launches... who knows, could go either way. That said, quality is quality, and if GTA6 does what Rockstar is known for, then we'll have a new bar set across the industry.It will get hyped til release regardless.",2,0.543,1.0,NEGATIVE
