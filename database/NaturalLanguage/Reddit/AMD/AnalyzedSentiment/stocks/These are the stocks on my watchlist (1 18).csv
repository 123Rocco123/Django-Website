,"No positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers) To clarify since I've been asked: I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel: they're just my perspective of where a stock could potentially go. Percentages signify what the stock is trading at when I write up the report and are NOT predictions of stock price EOD. Some of the stocks I post are <$500M market cap and are NOT good long-term investments, but are good candidates to day trade. JBLU/SAVE, liquidity 9/10- SAVE fell another 10% today- this probably isn’t going to go to 0, but I plan to trade any order flow that comes in with moderate/small size. NVDA, liquidity 8/10- Broke all times highs AGAIN- 575, 550, and 600 levels worth watching. This thing is a steam train and $600 is the major level that will make or break this stock (if we ever reach it). Not worth playing otherwise IMO. PLUG, liquidity 8/10- At Market sales agreement for $1B of stock. Similar to an offering, the company is selling stock for cash. AMD/TSM/Semis/etc. – TSM reported earnings/positive guidance today, pushing all the semis higher. Worth watching for the future. SLDP, liquidity 8/10- Solid Power and SK have three new agreements, seeing steady move downwards after initial pop. Worth playing if move becomes larger ($1 level potentially). Standing tickers TSLA, liquidity 7/10- Worth watching with Elon Musk fighting for 25% ownership of the company. RIOT/MARA/COIN/BITO/IBIT/HOOD/GBTC - Worth watching proxies off the open for order flow moves (will remove this when moves no longer get larger). JNPR, liquidity 9/10 – HPE confirmed to buy JNPR at $40/cash, just leaving this on here for people to be aware, or if you want to play the merger arb.",Think $SAVE worth a gamble at $5.25?,0,0.521,0.997,NEGATIVE
