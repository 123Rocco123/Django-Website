,"What most people do not realize is that the majority of the major studies are owned by larger entities that do not suffer from this. Sure its small term pain knowing that certain projects are on hold. There is a lot of content in the coffers that they can still continue to produce without additional writing. Most of the major studios also have other revenue streams that power them through. Let's just take Disney to start. They have $8.3B coming in from parks. They have $5.5B coming in from Streaming. They have 1.9 Billion coming in from cord deals. Look at Comcast, they have Peacock streamers, they have their existing cable business, they have their internet business (mixed with cable subscribers), they have their mobile unit.. they have plenty to keep powering their way through. Then you have weird companies like Apple and Amazon who can take virtual losses forever in entertainment and not care. Netflix is weird because of all its custom content but has a massive catalog of back content to keep subscribers happy for a while. What stocks to look at are the ones that rely only on content to stay alive. Those are the companies to be paying attention too. For instance I'd be very interested in how Warner Bro's/Discovery are going to be doing. I'd also look at Sony who owes a lot to their entertainment divisions for profits (sure they do electronics and niche other areas), but they own some of the larger studios. I also don't want to make this a political topic but the Writers guild really needs to re-think their leverage. Sure the major studio's wont have new content coming out and already put a massive backlog and delays to projects. The major studios now are conglomerates that own so many other businesses they can keep moving along. They also don't realize that these studios will keep generating revenue but don't have to pay any of the writers, actors, production, etc... they have a freeze on money coming in but also a freeze on money going out. The problem with industry consolidation + multi-faceted businesses is you lose your negotiating leverage. Would love to hear other peoples thoughts on this. What do you think? Especially their fear of AI As they know will becoming after their jobs. Netflix already was using it to determine what shows and themes would be the most productive for returns. Disney/ILM started using it to replace opening credits. Disney even hired the group that for the end of Mando Season 2 were Luke showed up, another group of people showed they could do a better Deep Fake and they hired them. If I'm not mistaken Netflix used AI to write one of black mirrors episodes. AI is coming and I can see why writers are so fearful. People are so naive on the idea that AI is coming for jobs even creative. If anything I'd love to hear from people some of the VFX studios if they are public? That would be were I would start putting money into. Ones that are progressive and have a massive catalogue. It sucks ILM is private (Disney owned), Pixar (Disney Owned), Dreamworks, etc. I wish Epic which powers the majority of games but also the Volume that is used in almost all new TV productions.... was public but they are private for now. At the end of the day the stocks to pay attention to are: The Chips Needed to Make these: Intel, Nvidia, AMD The Fabs that produce them: TSCM, Samsung, Intel Then there are companies producing the software: Epic, Blender, Unity. Adobe The Streaming Services: Netflix, Disney+, Max (Warner Bros) -- then you have youtube material being turned into its own streaming service like Curiositystream Inc. The Companies that specialize in building AI Model with datasets: OpenAI (Microsoft), Google, Facebook, ByteDance, etc. Royalty Companies: Dolby, IMAX Then there are the host of startups creating custom chips for these tasks (ASICS), newer software, and existing VFX studios who know how to power them all.

It would be pretty devastating if the strikes don’t get resolved. It’s slightly higher than Disney’s exposure since 40% of their operating income still comes from networks.That being said, I’m not convinced WBD would go bankrupt if the strikes don’t get resolved though. Discovery is pretty profitable, and actually there’s an argument to be made it’s under-monetized as part of the cable bundle. Apparently Discovery ARPU is something like 3-3.5 as part of the bundle? So they could charge 5 bucks for ad free Discovery+ and still come out ahead in the streaming wars. If WBD Stream, their programatic advertising business, does well then even a FAST version of Discovery+ would theoretically be more profitable than as part of the cable bundle. It’s not talked about too much, but Discovery took over Warner Bros from a position of strength in their spin-merge, rather it being a defensive play.For Warner Bros, even in the worst case scenario where they shut down Max entirely and have no new content, they’d still own the back catalog. I could imagine the other streaming players would pay a lot for the rights for Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, LOTR, Batman, Barbie, etc. So they would get the high margin licensing revenue without any additional content spend.

I can tell you with first hand experience how it will hurt the studios.“Scripts and movies that were never made being put back into post” is beyond incorrect lol.Doesn’t matter how many scripts you have when SAG is still out. 2) Most procedural TV shows write their scripts WHILE in production due to needing to change aspects week to week 3) Studios only have a limited number of productions made in any year, nearly all get released at some point. There’s no “massive” back log of content they shot but never released that they could just finish in post and release. 5) WGA and SAG are in expired contracts, anything released that fell within it, will require back pay that adheres to the new contract. Hence why certain content is being pulled from streaming services; they’re anticipating it.The only studio that is as diversified as you claim, is Disney. However, they already had massive revenue hits before the strike and it will be compounded by it.

My friends in Atlanta have said the same.“Anything shot before the strike can be finished afterwards” is beyond incorrect. IASTE isn’t on strike so local 600 (post) could be working on it at any time. Any reshoots can be touched up with VFX. Disney literally has 2 projects in post as we speak, although they’ve wrapped production for them well over a year ago. So no, there’s no “great excess of fresh content just waiting to be cut”.Q2 ‘24 return to work is not pessimistic, my last production ended right before the strike and we all knew then that the strike can easily take a year in regards to what’s at stake (Q1 ‘24). Nothing since then has changed that projection, if anything with how the studios have been behaving it could even be longer. Fall is one of the busiest times for the industry, the fact that nothing has changed is another omen for at least a Q2 ‘24 resolution.I’m not exaggerating when I say content releases can easily be hindered until ‘25 if the strike drags into ‘24; especially with any heavy post IP.",2,0.528,0.999,NEGATIVE

A strike in 2023 is not going to be the same as a strike in 2008. Apple and Amazon don't rely on their entertainment divisions for profit. They don't mind the strike lasting years. Netflix can rely on foreign content. In fact what is to stop traditional networks from canceling U.S. shows and replacing them with foreign shows? They could have shows similar to Grey's Anatomy or NCIU in Asia or Europe.Yet the success of Barbie and Oppenheimer have shown that movies can still be profitable so I think most studio executives want the strike to end.

You are shown movies, pictures, works of art, books, etc. You take all of that and start to use that as a foundation for creating your own works. You don't think AI can do the same thing.

Its not like he magically came out of the womb and was like im ready to direct the next big hit.We keep talking about LLM's but I worked for a company that was specifically designing AI for special awareness. What that means is having it recognize things like ""What is in the top left corner"", ""What is below the stop sign"", etc. Because the outside world has no clue, they only use the words LLM's.

AI creative works of fiction are bland, unengaging, incoherent tropes that don’t grab audiences in a way that make a piece of media worth watching.

,"What most people do not realize is that the majority of the major studies are owned by larger entities that do not suffer from this. Sure its small term pain knowing that certain projects are on hold. There is a lot of content in the coffers that they can still continue to produce without additional writing. Most of the major studios also have other revenue streams that power them through. Let's just take Disney to start. They have $8.3B coming in from parks. They have $5.5B coming in from Streaming. They have 1.9 Billion coming in from cord deals. Look at Comcast, they have Peacock streamers, they have their existing cable business, they have their internet business (mixed with cable subscribers), they have their mobile unit.. they have plenty to keep powering their way through. Then you have weird companies like Apple and Amazon who can take virtual losses forever in entertainment and not care. Netflix is weird because of all its custom content but has a massive catalog of back content to keep subscribers happy for a while. What stocks to look at are the ones that rely only on content to stay alive. Those are the companies to be paying attention too.

I'd also look at Sony who owes a lot to their entertainment divisions for profits (sure they do electronics and niche other areas), but they own some of the larger studios. I also don't want to make this a political topic but the Writers guild really needs to re-think their leverage. Sure the major studio's wont have new content coming out and already put a massive backlog and delays to projects.

For all but the very top productions, those writers are just nice to have. Soap operas required no talent in script writing, and 90% of today's money making shows are just one step above those: the AI would do just fine for them.So. The writing is on the wall. The only thing that is going for writers is that transition to AI will take some time, and during this transitional period - I'd guess 3 to 5 years - the writers would be still needed to fill the (temporary) gaps. That's you leverage. All of it.",0,0.531,0.664,NEGATIVE
