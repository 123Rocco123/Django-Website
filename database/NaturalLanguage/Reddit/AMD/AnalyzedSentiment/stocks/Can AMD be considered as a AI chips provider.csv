There are some new AI farms but that won't have large adoption for production workloads. Neither would spend lot of time training models in these small farms only to realize there are very limited options to host inference applications Azure or OCP. Where is AMD falling behind to improve their market share?,It seems that AMD will keep growing a bit because it is eating the crumbs left by Nvidia.,0,0.579,NEGATIVE,0.932

Where is AMD falling behind to improve their market share?,Back when semiconductors bottomed and I wasn’t as savvy about investing I bought AMD over NVDA because the latter had a high multiple and I thought AMD was a better deal. Here I am a couple years later with a mere double on my investment instead of 10x. I never cared about P/E after that,1,0.554,POSITIVE,0.991

Where is AMD falling behind to improve their market share?,"AMD will be fine. I believe their stock has a path to doubling within 5 years (I am being conservative as I believe it’ll likely happen within 3 years). Their data centre business is brand new and went from $0 to $5b annual in one year. The TAM will increase 4x by 2027. Even if AMD maintains its 4% or so market share it’ll see its data centre revenues increase to $20b annually (which is about what the entire company makes annually). Data centre margins are quite high (53.5% or so).Realistically, AMD’s market share will grow so we’re likely looking at least $30b in annual GPU revenue in the coming years.I still believe Nvidia will be the better performer since their sales and margins are much higher, however AMD will probably undercut their margins by competing on price. I would own both and Broadcom since the hyperscalers will continue to spend big on this.",0,0.589,NEGATIVE,0.986
