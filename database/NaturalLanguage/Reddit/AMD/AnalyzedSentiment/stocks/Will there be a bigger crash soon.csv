No one can predict a crash, however it would seem to me that the speculative bubble kicked off by COVID two years ago has yet to truly pop.The rate hikes of 2022 have yet to be fully realized in valuations of equities. And there are more hikes coming throughout this year. Inflation has not been tamed sufficiently, and unemployment is still at record lows.It’s going to almost certainly serve your financial interest best to be patient and DCA (dollar cost average) into any equity position you are interested in.

Some might use technical analysis to determine what price to DCA in. There're quite a lot of arbitrary ways to do this, and I'm sure none is proven better than the other.All of this isn't really as important as making sure your price target is correct, and your probability is correct since if you time is not perfectly, sure you miss out on some gains.

Then you will need to learn Discount Cash Flow valuation models, which requires a good amount of math. Then you'd need years of practicing the model and back-testing before you feel comfortable putting real money on it.Now you also need to know a bit about macro-economics, since a lot of blue chip cyclical companies performance depend on economic cycles, and interest rate varies quite a lot based on the economy, and interest rate is very important for your DCF valuation model.And then you also need the patience, and composure. You need to not FOMO in when things go up, and you need to not panic and second guess yourself when things go down.You don't have to do all these things, and most retail investors don't. But then how much money are you willing to risk with little investing knowledge? And the frustrating thing is even with all that time dedication, you're not guaranteed to outperform, and even if you do, it probably won't be much (percentage wise) if you measure over 40 years of investing. So it's one of those things where you're not guaranteed better performance with better effort, and even if you get better performance, is it worth the dedication?The alternative is of course dollar cost average into an index fund, either VT or VOO. This requires no time dedication, no mental stress thinking about it, no learning.

It has a cult around it which makes its demand much higher than it should be, therefore propping up the price.On the opposite end, there's BTU which is a coal miner and has artificially low demand due to ESG shit, so it's sitting at 26 a share even though it's gonna probably make 10+ in EPS this year. It printed 3.93 in Q4 and is still at 26 LOL",2,0.538,1.0,NEGATIVE
