,"Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities. This is a daily watchlist for trading. I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you‚Äôre on old reddit, click ‚Äúshow images‚Äù at the top to see all the charts quickly. I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like ‚ÄúThoughts on _____? will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. News: Novavax Soars on $1.2 Billion Sanofi Vaccine Licensing Deal News worth mentioning: We might have a geomagnetic storm that will affect electronics such as GPS, mobile phone networks, power grids, etc. Fed also commented that inflation data has been disappointing and that it is too early to think about cutting rates- we might have 0 rate cuts this year. US will impose tariffs on China EVs likely early next week. Worth watching NIO,BYD, TSLA, etc. SG- Reports -.23 vs -.21 expected EPS, revenue is 157.9M vs 152M exp. Overall met expectations. However, they raised their guidance. AMD- Possibly affected due to news about the rate cut- trading the most cleanly of all the semis for this news. (possibly also from the geomagnetic storm? Unlikely though) NVAX- Watching this for places to both go long and short above $11. News above.   GME- We saw massive momentum Friday at the close, then again Monday in the morning. It hasn‚Äôt retraced the move for the last 5 days. Yesterday I thought it was worth keeping an eye on past $17, today I‚Äôm looking for places to play a short. Longer-term watches: NVDA/SMCI, BA, ULTA, TSLA  ","ZK IPO today, worth watching.",0,0.551,0.999,POSITIVE
