,I am just getting back into stock trading and I would like to know how you guys develop your exit strategy for your stocks? For example I have an enbridge exit for 2028 as a lot of their projects start in 2026 according to morningstar.

I re-evaluate everything every year, but for the most part, I sell when the company changes directions. If a company is bought, I don't always agree with the parent company's direction.

If it's an investment like AAPL or COST, I'll just h0dl and won't be selling for the foreseeable future. If it's a trade I'll set an 8% stop loss and I'm out no questions asked. I'll sell a profitable trade when I sense the trend is reversing and won't ever let a winner turn into a loser.Having said that I allocate most of my portfolio to long term holds.

If a stock's price has gone down then that's great, because whatever reason I had for investing in the company is still true, and now I can pick up some good deals. I would sell a stock if their business model changed and I no longer thought they're a good long term investment, but it's rare for them to change that radically.",0,0.582,0.995,POSITIVE

If it goes down below the stop loss, it simply means you can buy even more when you buy back in.

Nvidia, Qualcomm, Intel, etc., are some of their competitors but this industry has room to grow so everyone can eat.Financially, AMD is doing really well.The products are getting better every year and they are constantly innovating.I don't see a reason to sell unless you see a better opportunity elsewhere.
