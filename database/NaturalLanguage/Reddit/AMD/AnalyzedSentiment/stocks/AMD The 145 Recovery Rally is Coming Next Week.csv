Crux of the matter is AMD’s core business has been lagging while data server revenue has simply offset loses of core biz. Overall revenues have been flat for 2+ years. Underperforming SPY when every tech company is up is pathetic. Heck, you’d have made more money this year holding fixed income rather than AMD.Nvidia is gonna do like $200b next year.

I bought shares when its trading at $17, $30, $70, $90, $130, $170 and $180 . It won’t take much for NVDA to easily loose 10 % market share , companies have to manage their vendor risk. Will I be buying more ? Of course , I strongly believe that AMD will hit $300 by 2027 end . I will just ignore short term noise and unnecessary noise around p/e (without considering xilinx acquisition impact). Check their latest patent filings etc. AMD has a lot of future . Will it hit $145 next week ? It may or it may hit $125 also , ignore short term noise . I am not talking about options traders , good luck with that",0,0.545,POSITIVE,0.962
