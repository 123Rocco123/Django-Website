Thank you all for your help!","Even I can’t project out a company beyond 3 years. I don’t understand how you can do so for 20 years. Knowing what I know about these listed companies, they aren’t all “sleep well at night” stocks. There are risks associated with these investments so you shouldn’t convince yourself that buying at whatever price is okay simply because you plan to hold for 20 years. Unexpected things happen. The top companies of each decade continue to change. Even something as strong as Google had its moat questioned earlier in the year. So I don’t see how you can do a 20 year DCF.For example PANW is in a rising industry and I consider their offerings to be higher quality compared to some of the other cyber companies. But what if PANW starts making stupid acquisitions? Do you keep blindly buying the stock? Another retail favorite for this case is O. I predict they will see chronic underperformance if they continue DCAing into O. The business has changed so investors need to adapt and not hold onto old ideas.The concept of DCA has been bastardized by retail investors. It is perfectly feasible and recommended most people DCA and hold for 20+ years… for broadly diversified ETFs. Not for individual stocks, especially not for unprofitable companies such as RKLB which are impossible to predict more than a couple of years out.If you want outperformance, which I believe you do because you’re taking on extra risk by buying individual stocks, you want to keep assessing if your business is still going on the right track. And if you don’t want outperformance and just want to keep buying high quality businesses, just DCA into the index because those are the top companies in the world.I will close my comment by saying this: I buy stocks and project them for only 3 years but I always HOPE the company keeps executing so I can hold it for 20+ years. I don’t always DCA into them but I don’t mind averaging up or down if the company continues to do well. That’s how I get my 10 baggers. Companies always surprise to the upside or downside.",2,0.549,0.945,NEGATIVE

Thank you all for your help!","You're misunderstanding. Allocating a small percentage of your portfolio to individual stocks is a wise decision, but that's due to limiting risk, it has nothing to do with the comment that these are expensive stocks. Expensive is a relative term. A $50 stock could be more expensive than a $500 stock. The expense is judged in terms of P/E ratio, where P is the price of the stock and E is their most recent annual earnings. When you buy a stock, it's not a number on a screen, it's a tiny piece of a company. Now, if I can own a piece of a company for $10, and they produce $1 in annual earning per share, that's a 10 P/E and could be an excellent investment opportunity IF that company will continue indefinitely and perhaps even grow (growth is also relative to the rest of the economy). In contrast a company with only $1 in earnings but a $50 stock price is a much riskier proposition, because that company would need to grow tremendously for it to be eventually be able to pay out dividends and increase the stock price through buy backs to reward me for my initial investment. In simplified terms, the P/E reflects the growth expectation that's currently priced into the stock. If it exceeds that expectation you do well. If it falls short of that expectation, you'll do poorly. The entire S&P500 is currently at an elevated P/E but few moreso than the ""magnificent 7."" If you've owned any of them for a long time, sure, keep holding, but now is not a good time to buy into MSFT or NVDA, nor AMD, nor COST. Use your own judgment on the rest.",2,0.586,1.0,NEGATIVE

The only two that have some fundamental growth at a reasonable price are Visa and MasterCard. The question is will they outperform the s&p 500 for 20 years? That gets way more hazyIf you told me to take $50,000 and allocate it into something I couldn't touch for 20 years.5,000 would go into Bitcoin and $45,000 would go into the s&p 500Think it out, in 2003, what was popular? That was also an ideal time to buy stocks so you're getting a real help there. You would have bought home builders, you would have bought financials, you might have bought some metals and mining, it wasn't really obvious that trade was working yet though. If you would have bought what was working previously. If you would have hit Amazon and Microsoft even if you messed up the rest, if you held it for 20 years you would be fine. It's just hard to figure that out now because everything you listed is already a grown company. Massive company. The real growth is found in smaller companies that are innovative and changing the world. If one of those pops up. Cool, hold on. But they aren't these massive mega market cap Giants. Think about how ridiculous the market cap would be on just a 2x with Microsoft right now. There are stocks in the Russell 2000 right now that are going to be leaders 10 years from now.
