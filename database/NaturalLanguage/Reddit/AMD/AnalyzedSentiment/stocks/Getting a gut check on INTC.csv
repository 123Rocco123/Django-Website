,"YTD INTC is down about 58.5% as of last check and in the short run it's outlook looks terrible especially given the negative press with their core product desktop CPUs. However I can't help but draw parallels to how AMD was looking about 10 years ago trading for under $2 and now for roughly $130. In some ways I feel Intel has a much better potential to bounce back than even AMD did. Chief of which being how incredibly wide their business is. While AMD is chiefly focused on CPUs and GPUs, Intel has both plus a much stronger presence in wireless chips, storage hardware, the USB patent and may others that AMD does / did not have. In fact if you open up an Intel based desktop or laptop there's a good chance the majority of the comments could be Intel based. Plus they do have manufacturing capabilities that AMD does not have and major sponsorship from the US government to bring that production to the US as a strategicly important product manufacturing firm. This seems to be prime opportunity for Intel to consolidate to their core business and spin off smaller divisions to generate cash to grow their core business back to profitability. And AMD and Intel functioning as essentially a duopoly in the x86 space neither can really go away. However, things are different now than with the recovery of AMD. Chief of which being the rise of ARM and alternatives to the x86 architecture like with Apple silicone. I keep going back on if INTC is the best value buy opportunity in a while or it really is the hot garbage the recent controversy about their 13th and 14th Gen CPUs failing in mass make it seem to be. Note, I'm just a casual stocks speculator and PC gaming enthusiast and really should dig into their balance sheets more. Edit: just to be clear, I haven't bought into INTC yet, just testing the waters and getting a gut check before I make any moves. I feel confident they will recover eventually but, as I mentioned in a comment here, I'm concerned about to what extent and how soon. Is the opportunity cost of buying and holding now or even buying long term call options worth it compared to just holding the cash in a money market or investing in SPY? That opportunity cost I'm not as confident on.","I agree, Intel is a value trap.But sentiment on this thread is so negative it makes me want to buy.

Not good. They are rushing M4 to compete against not Qualcomm, but Intel. Which will have a similar chiplet style like Apple. And on chip power delivery to get that battery life up past 8 hours and it will likely run cool and compete with them on all fronts.Intel has working silicon for their 18A which is 1.8 NM, and it’s coming in 1st half. They will be a foundry by 2027. TSMC could barely get 3nm going. No competition and constant misses.So let’s this sink in for a bit. They literally have an Apple silicon answer and an ARM answer. They are literally building foundries with technology that TSMC is frantically trying to catchup on and is 6 months behind for onboard power delivery for example. And x86 is widely compatible and companies will eat it up.Cutting bloated staff, got 8 billion from the govt to see to this plan through etc.And telegraphed and told us it would be a rough quarter. The 13th and 14th gen is the only woldcard that is driving emotions high for an over represented group of edgy gamers who upgrade their CPU’s every 2-4 years. They just tacked on a 2 year extended warranty. Move on.It’s just not rational this doom and gloom stance. Logical people are being drowned out by people heavy into Nvidia and who know nothing about the actual products and how it is beyond competitive. Remember Jensens biggest fear. This is a cut throat industry and Intel is very much primed to take share in the coming years. It would be suicide to bet against them IMO.",0,0.55,NEGATIVE,1.0

Glad I did, because it's never gone back up since (outside of a hedge fund pump and dump simply to convince the masses to ""buy the deal"" before they shed their losses) despite Intel doing nothing wrong up to recently, and they're not going anywhere. A cantankerous old man once said ""you don't need a formal conspiracy when interests converge"" and I think we're seeing that with the market of today. To the moon, right? ""This bubble is too big to possibly burst"", because it's the ""new normal"" to be overvalued because ""PE doesnt mean anything"" since they can get more investors for the next hype-train. Well... those AI companies are hemorrhaging money, billions, and what happens when those investors come knocking? Well, like we saw today, those who have shared interest will signal to buy ""at a discount"" and then opportunistically sell off in afterhours. Public sentiment is bad because a lot of people lost money by thinking ""line always go up"", yet it never did.Besides the nonsense of the modern market, Intel is the one who will support the US when the inevitable happens across the pacific, and public sentiment will change when nobody can get their precious AI chips. The investors are starting to see that AI burns more money than it generates, is projected to burn more, and still hallucinates wildly limiting its usefulness. Metrics don't matter anymore, the market is dominated by converged interests and Intel will remain in the gutter regardless of their news until something sticks, like an issue in the East, and the masses converge and change their tune to ""it's a bargain"".",0,0.55,NEGATIVE,1.0
