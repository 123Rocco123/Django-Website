,"I’ve sold covered calls in higher volatility stocks before. Enjoy the extra cash and have only lost my shares once (but repurchased later at lower price than what I sold for…lucky I guess). What are other users thoughts on selling covered calls? Any specific strategies (sell short dated calls, long dated, strike price close to current market price or much higher strike)?

The important part is to pick the price point you would be happy to exit the long position at, and the premium becomes the cherry on top.",0,0.525,0.814,POSITIVE

Thx",I sold CC on GOOGL throughout the bear market and had decent returns without shares being called away. I’d sell 30-45 DTE for a price around 1% of the underlying.The issue now is volatility is so low (VIX at 12) that premiums aren’t really worth it. I was looking today and to get 1% on Jan 19 exp would have to sell options only about 5% above the current share price.. totally not worth it as the stock has done like 10% in a week..,0,0.542,1.0,NEGATIVE

Thx","my goal is to collect the premium and not sell shares. for example amazon and google have weekly contracts that expire on friday. so every friday around 10 am i login and setup cc contracts. i price my shares $2-4 above market price and pray that market price does not reach my sell price. the premiums on such contracts are small, i usually make $5-10 on one cc contract.the key is that contract has only one day to trade. it is much less likely to skyrocket and reach sell price and shares be called away.",2,0.541,1.0,NEGATIVE

Thx","It’s up to you on how risky you want to be and how much time you want to invest. I write covered calls often. On the stocks I don’t mind losing, which is really only when I’m doing the wheel strategy, I use a .4-.3 delta. I’ll sell them monthly and check on them every couple days. If the stock moves a ton, I’ll roll it back a month or two and out a little more (getting more premium in the process), but at a certain point it doesn’t make sense to roll and I just let it take my stock. At that time I’ve made good premium selling calls and gains on the stocks increase. I’ll then start selling puts.If I do care about the stock though or I’m doing a poor man’s covered call, I’ll target a .3-.2 (sometimes lower) delta. The premiums are much less, but there is less risk as well. If it does explode for some reason I’ll roll. If it continues to explode, I’ll roll at a loss just to push it even further out and into a .1ish delta. I don’t mind losing some of the premium if the stock is going up a ton and I want to hold for the long term.Remember. Covered calls are best on stocks moving slightly up, slightly down, or staying flat. The more volatility, the higher the premium, but the higher the risk of it hitting your strike.",0,0.531,0.995,NEGATIVE

Thx",I sell covered calls at times and it’s a mixed bag. On one hand it’s a way to lock in profits and get a premium for doing so. On the other hand I’ve kicked myself more than once as I watch the stock increase blow past the premium I got paid for the call,0,0.539,0.992,NEGATIVE
