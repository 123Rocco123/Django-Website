,"Intel stock dropped 6% Wednesday after the company gave investors an update on the company’s turnaround plan to become a foundry competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Intel’s new reporting structure could help control costs at the chipmaker, which is seeking to trim as much as $10 billion from its costs over the next three years. Other chip stocks also fell Wednesday amid a down day for tech stocks. Intel stock dropped 6% Wednesday after the company gave investors an update on the company’s turnaround plan to become a chip manufacturing company competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Wednesday’s update featured Intel’s Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner explaining how the company would soon change the way it reports its financial results to give its foundry business, known as IFS, its own profit-and-loss statement, which would reveal the company’s manufacturing margins. Intel’s new reporting structure could also help control costs at the chipmaker, which is seeking to trim as much as $10 billion from its costs over the next three years. The update comes as investors continue to assess Intel’s turnaround plan under CEO Pat Gelsinger, which depends on catching up with TSMC’s manufacturing technology by 2026, a plan it calls “five nodes in four years.” Intel plans to use its own chips to work out problems in its manufacturing before opening the factories to third-party companies. If Intel catches up with TSMC, then it can compete for contracts to build high-performance chips from companies such as Apple, Nvidia, and Qualcomm , which don’t run their own manufacturing and currently often opt for TSMC or Samsung manufacturing. Intel said it expected to announce a key customer for its foundry business later this year. “The manufacturing group will now face the same market dynamics as their foundry counterparts,” Zinsner told analysts. “They’ll need to compete for volume through performance and price as internal customers will have the option to leverage third-party foundries and to attract external foundry volume, they must do the same.” Wednesday’s update was focused on how Intel would use its manufacturing capabilities for its own chips. It said more updates on the foundry business and third-party customers would come later this year. Intel also said its own chip needs would contribute $20 billion in revenue to the unit next year. Analysts on the call worried about Intel’s gross margins and asked how this plan would increase them. In April, Intel said its gross margin for the first quarter was 38.4%, down 51.3% in a year. Intel management said Wednesday it was shooting for 60% margins. Separately, Intel said Wednesday that it planned to sell 20% of an Austrian subsidiary, IMS Nanofabrication, to private equity firm Bain Capital in a deal that valued the unit at $4.3 billion. “This will turn out to be one of the best acquisitions we’ve ever made, given that level of valuation and investment made,” Zinsner said Wednesday. Other chip stocks also fell Wednesday amid a down day for tech stocks. AMD , Intel’s chief rival, fell nearly 6%, while Qualcomm fell more than 3%. Nvidia, which has been boosted by the recent artificial intelligence wave, fell less than 2%.","Nothing particularly bad was said, don't understand the drop. Having separate reporting is a good thing, and it sounds like they are going to treat them as a separate business, they will have to compete for customers, including intel.

Intel used to have a huge advantage in single threaded performance, now they may have a slight advantage depending on the application. AMD exceeds in most multi-threaded performance. The biggest change is that AMD is now a viable choice for corporate or datacenter usage. 10 years ago, I was dismissed out of hand when I asked for a machine with an AMD processor; now companies are willing to go with them.This means that Intel can no longer command the price premium over AMD; they need to compete on price because their performance is comparable.Also their stand alone aimer at mid tier gpus a770 for 200 bucksYou are making my point for me; they can't sell graphics cards for $500-1000 like AMD and NVidia, so they are stuck competing in the midrange.",3,0.561,1.0,NEGATIVE

,"Intel stock dropped 6% Wednesday after the company gave investors an update on the company’s turnaround plan to become a foundry competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.

Other chip stocks also fell Wednesday amid a down day for tech stocks. Intel stock dropped 6% Wednesday after the company gave investors an update on the company’s turnaround plan to become a chip manufacturing company competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Wednesday’s update featured Intel’s Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner explaining how the company would soon change the way it reports its financial results to give its foundry business, known as IFS, its own profit-and-loss statement, which would reveal the company’s manufacturing margins. Intel’s new reporting structure could also help control costs at the chipmaker, which is seeking to trim as much as $10 billion from its costs over the next three years. The update comes as investors continue to assess Intel’s turnaround plan under CEO Pat Gelsinger, which depends on catching up with TSMC’s manufacturing technology by 2026, a plan it calls “five nodes in four years.” Intel plans to use its own chips to work out problems in its manufacturing before opening the factories to third-party companies. If Intel catches up with TSMC, then it can compete for contracts to build high-performance chips from companies such as Apple, Nvidia, and Qualcomm , which don’t run their own manufacturing and currently often opt for TSMC or Samsung manufacturing. Intel said it expected to announce a key customer for its foundry business later this year. “The manufacturing group will now face the same market dynamics as their foundry counterparts,” Zinsner told analysts. “They’ll need to compete for volume through performance and price as internal customers will have the option to leverage third-party foundries and to attract external foundry volume, they must do the same.” Wednesday’s update was focused on how Intel would use its manufacturing capabilities for its own chips. It said more updates on the foundry business and third-party customers would come later this year. Intel also said its own chip needs would contribute $20 billion in revenue to the unit next year. Analysts on the call worried about Intel’s gross margins and asked how this plan would increase them. In April, Intel said its gross margin for the first quarter was 38.4%, down 51.3% in a year. Intel management said Wednesday it was shooting for 60% margins. Separately, Intel said Wednesday that it planned to sell 20% of an Austrian subsidiary, IMS Nanofabrication, to private equity firm Bain Capital in a deal that valued the unit at $4.3 billion. “This will turn out to be one of the best acquisitions we’ve ever made, given that level of valuation and investment made,” Zinsner said Wednesday.

,"Intel stock dropped 6% Wednesday after the company gave investors an update on the company’s turnaround plan to become a foundry competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.

Intel stock dropped 6% Wednesday after the company gave investors an update on the company’s turnaround plan to become a chip manufacturing company competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.

Intel’s new reporting structure could also help control costs at the chipmaker, which is seeking to trim as much as $10 billion from its costs over the next three years. The update comes as investors continue to assess Intel’s turnaround plan under CEO Pat Gelsinger, which depends on catching up with TSMC’s manufacturing technology by 2026, a plan it calls “five nodes in four years.” Intel plans to use its own chips to work out problems in its manufacturing before opening the factories to third-party companies. If Intel catches up with TSMC, then it can compete for contracts to build high-performance chips from companies such as Apple, Nvidia, and Qualcomm , which don’t run their own manufacturing and currently often opt for TSMC or Samsung manufacturing. Intel said it expected to announce a key customer for its foundry business later this year. “The manufacturing group will now face the same market dynamics as their foundry counterparts,” Zinsner told analysts. “They’ll need to compete for volume through performance and price as internal customers will have the option to leverage third-party foundries and to attract external foundry volume, they must do the same.” Wednesday’s update was focused on how Intel would use its manufacturing capabilities for its own chips.

In the 80s the thinking was that US semiconductors would never catch up to their Japanese rivals and then the US stepped in and bitch slapped Japan's semiconductor industry until it became practically irrelevant. I think at this point it's pretty clear that semiconductors are viewed as being strategically important which is why fabs and semiconductor research is being subsidized now in the US and the EU. I am not sure if Taiwan and South Korea will want to compete in a subsidies race with the US to begin with or if they will want to pivot elsewhere.

Wednesday’s update featured Intel’s Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner explaining how the company would soon change the way it reports its financial results to give its foundry business, known as IFS, its own profit-and-loss statement, which would reveal the company’s manufacturing margins. Intel’s new reporting structure could also help control costs at the chipmaker, which is seeking to trim as much as $10 billion from its costs over the next three years. The update comes as investors continue to assess Intel’s turnaround plan under CEO Pat Gelsinger, which depends on catching up with TSMC’s manufacturing technology by 2026, a plan it calls “five nodes in four years.” Intel plans to use its own chips to work out problems in its manufacturing before opening the factories to third-party companies. If Intel catches up with TSMC, then it can compete for contracts to build high-performance chips from companies such as Apple, Nvidia, and Qualcomm , which don’t run their own manufacturing and currently often opt for TSMC or Samsung manufacturing. Intel said it expected to announce a key customer for its foundry business later this year. “The manufacturing group will now face the same market dynamics as their foundry counterparts,” Zinsner told analysts. “They’ll need to compete for volume through performance and price as internal customers will have the option to leverage third-party foundries and to attract external foundry volume, they must do the same.” Wednesday’s update was focused on how Intel would use its manufacturing capabilities for its own chips. It said more updates on the foundry business and third-party customers would come later this year. Intel also said its own chip needs would contribute $20 billion in revenue to the unit next year. Analysts on the call worried about Intel’s gross margins and asked how this plan would increase them. In April, Intel said its gross margin for the first quarter was 38.4%, down 51.3% in a year. Intel management said Wednesday it was shooting for 60% margins. Separately, Intel said Wednesday that it planned to sell 20% of an Austrian subsidiary, IMS Nanofabrication, to private equity firm Bain Capital in a deal that valued the unit at $4.3 billion. “This will turn out to be one of the best acquisitions we’ve ever made, given that level of valuation and investment made,” Zinsner said Wednesday.

Intel 10nm is equivalent to TSMC 7nm, Intel 4 is equivalent to TSMC 5nm and Intel 3 is equivalent to TSMC 3nm. So clearly they are somewhat catching up. The bigger issues are Intel is significantly less efficient at manufacturing wafers than TSMC. Intel requires more fab space for the same output due to lower tool utilization rates and worse yields. To catch up with AMD they made cores larger with more transistors that guzzle more power to achieve similar performance. Based on Intel's presentation to address all these problems now they are going to rapidly shrink nodes twice Intel 4/3 and Intel 20A/18A. I am not sure if that alone is enough because TSMC operates at much bigger scale and more efficient than Intel and there is no shortage for TSMC orders.

Intel stock dropped 6% Wednesday after the company gave investors an update on the company’s turnaround plan to become a chip manufacturing company competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Wednesday’s update featured Intel’s Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner explaining how the company would soon change the way it reports its financial results to give its foundry business, known as IFS, its own profit-and-loss statement, which would reveal the company’s manufacturing margins. Intel’s new reporting structure could also help control costs at the chipmaker, which is seeking to trim as much as $10 billion from its costs over the next three years. The update comes as investors continue to assess Intel’s turnaround plan under CEO Pat Gelsinger, which depends on catching up with TSMC’s manufacturing technology by 2026, a plan it calls “five nodes in four years.” Intel plans to use its own chips to work out problems in its manufacturing before opening the factories to third-party companies. If Intel catches up with TSMC, then it can compete for contracts to build high-performance chips from companies such as Apple, Nvidia, and Qualcomm , which don’t run their own manufacturing and currently often opt for TSMC or Samsung manufacturing. Intel said it expected to announce a key customer for its foundry business later this year. “The manufacturing group will now face the same market dynamics as their foundry counterparts,” Zinsner told analysts. “They’ll need to compete for volume through performance and price as internal customers will have the option to leverage third-party foundries and to attract external foundry volume, they must do the same.” Wednesday’s update was focused on how Intel would use its manufacturing capabilities for its own chips. It said more updates on the foundry business and third-party customers would come later this year. Intel also said its own chip needs would contribute $20 billion in revenue to the unit next year. Analysts on the call worried about Intel’s gross margins and asked how this plan would increase them. In April, Intel said its gross margin for the first quarter was 38.4%, down 51.3% in a year. Intel management said Wednesday it was shooting for 60% margins. Separately, Intel said Wednesday that it planned to sell 20% of an Austrian subsidiary, IMS Nanofabrication, to private equity firm Bain Capital in a deal that valued the unit at $4.3 billion. “This will turn out to be one of the best acquisitions we’ve ever made, given that level of valuation and investment made,” Zinsner said Wednesday. Other chip stocks also fell Wednesday amid a down day for tech stocks. AMD , Intel’s chief rival, fell nearly 6%, while Qualcomm fell more than 3%.

Until recently the most advanced process was also the cheapest as the reduced silicon space needed offset the higher cost of the more advanced wafer, now that dynamic is reversed and the bleeding edge has a premium cost per transistor.All these dynamics produce continued opportunity for the ""second best"" foundry.",4,0.551,0.997,POSITIVE

Wednesday’s update featured Intel’s Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner explaining how the company would soon change the way it reports its financial results to give its foundry business, known as IFS, its own profit-and-loss statement, which would reveal the company’s manufacturing margins. Intel’s new reporting structure could also help control costs at the chipmaker, which is seeking to trim as much as $10 billion from its costs over the next three years. The update comes as investors continue to assess Intel’s turnaround plan under CEO Pat Gelsinger, which depends on catching up with TSMC’s manufacturing technology by 2026, a plan it calls “five nodes in four years.” Intel plans to use its own chips to work out problems in its manufacturing before opening the factories to third-party companies. If Intel catches up with TSMC, then it can compete for contracts to build high-performance chips from companies such as Apple, Nvidia, and Qualcomm , which don’t run their own manufacturing and currently often opt for TSMC or Samsung manufacturing. Intel said it expected to announce a key customer for its foundry business later this year. “The manufacturing group will now face the same market dynamics as their foundry counterparts,” Zinsner told analysts. “They’ll need to compete for volume through performance and price as internal customers will have the option to leverage third-party foundries and to attract external foundry volume, they must do the same.” Wednesday’s update was focused on how Intel would use its manufacturing capabilities for its own chips. It said more updates on the foundry business and third-party customers would come later this year. Intel also said its own chip needs would contribute $20 billion in revenue to the unit next year. Analysts on the call worried about Intel’s gross margins and asked how this plan would increase them. In April, Intel said its gross margin for the first quarter was 38.4%, down 51.3% in a year. Intel management said Wednesday it was shooting for 60% margins. Separately, Intel said Wednesday that it planned to sell 20% of an Austrian subsidiary, IMS Nanofabrication, to private equity firm Bain Capital in a deal that valued the unit at $4.3 billion. “This will turn out to be one of the best acquisitions we’ve ever made, given that level of valuation and investment made,” Zinsner said Wednesday. Other chip stocks also fell Wednesday amid a down day for tech stocks. AMD , Intel’s chief rival, fell nearly 6%, while Qualcomm fell more than 3%. Nvidia, which has been boosted by the recent artificial intelligence wave, fell less than 2%.",Don't you also have to factor in how much onshoring and national security is driving these factors? Companies are looking to diversify away from risks associated with tsmc and to more American companies. American government would probably just throw cash at Intel to keep them afloat until they are online. I can almost see Intel as protected as caterpillar in terms of government contracts etc. Chips are the new part of national security.,2,0.536,0.731,NEGATIVE

Locating the fabs in USA is only one piece of the puzzle. Raw material sources are highly specialized and still located in some of the same places CHIPS is trying to diversify away from. Advanced packaging is becoming another critical element and TSMC's abilities are not completely interchangeable with other suppliers. Outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) - third party testing and packaging is often done in completely different countries at lower cost, places like Indonesia, Vietnam.

Intel said it expected to announce a key customer for its foundry business later this year. “The manufacturing group will now face the same market dynamics as their foundry counterparts,” Zinsner told analysts. “They’ll need to compete for volume through performance and price as internal customers will have the option to leverage third-party foundries and to attract external foundry volume, they must do the same.” Wednesday’s update was focused on how Intel would use its manufacturing capabilities for its own chips. It said more updates on the foundry business and third-party customers would come later this year. Intel also said its own chip needs would contribute $20 billion in revenue to the unit next year. Analysts on the call worried about Intel’s gross margins and asked how this plan would increase them. In April, Intel said its gross margin for the first quarter was 38.4%, down 51.3% in a year. Intel management said Wednesday it was shooting for 60% margins. Separately, Intel said Wednesday that it planned to sell 20% of an Austrian subsidiary, IMS Nanofabrication, to private equity firm Bain Capital in a deal that valued the unit at $4.3 billion. “This will turn out to be one of the best acquisitions we’ve ever made, given that level of valuation and investment made,” Zinsner said Wednesday.

Wednesday’s update featured Intel’s Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner explaining how the company would soon change the way it reports its financial results to give its foundry business, known as IFS, its own profit-and-loss statement, which would reveal the company’s manufacturing margins. Intel’s new reporting structure could also help control costs at the chipmaker, which is seeking to trim as much as $10 billion from its costs over the next three years. The update comes as investors continue to assess Intel’s turnaround plan under CEO Pat Gelsinger, which depends on catching up with TSMC’s manufacturing technology by 2026, a plan it calls “five nodes in four years.” Intel plans to use its own chips to work out problems in its manufacturing before opening the factories to third-party companies. If Intel catches up with TSMC, then it can compete for contracts to build high-performance chips from companies such as Apple, Nvidia, and Qualcomm , which don’t run their own manufacturing and currently often opt for TSMC or Samsung manufacturing. Intel said it expected to announce a key customer for its foundry business later this year. “The manufacturing group will now face the same market dynamics as their foundry counterparts,” Zinsner told analysts. “They’ll need to compete for volume through performance and price as internal customers will have the option to leverage third-party foundries and to attract external foundry volume, they must do the same.” Wednesday’s update was focused on how Intel would use its manufacturing capabilities for its own chips. It said more updates on the foundry business and third-party customers would come later this year. Intel also said its own chip needs would contribute $20 billion in revenue to the unit next year. Analysts on the call worried about Intel’s gross margins and asked how this plan would increase them. In April, Intel said its gross margin for the first quarter was 38.4%, down 51.3% in a year. Intel management said Wednesday it was shooting for 60% margins. Separately, Intel said Wednesday that it planned to sell 20% of an Austrian subsidiary, IMS Nanofabrication, to private equity firm Bain Capital in a deal that valued the unit at $4.3 billion. “This will turn out to be one of the best acquisitions we’ve ever made, given that level of valuation and investment made,” Zinsner said Wednesday. Other chip stocks also fell Wednesday amid a down day for tech stocks. AMD , Intel’s chief rival, fell nearly 6%, while Qualcomm fell more than 3%.
