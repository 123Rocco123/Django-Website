,"was originally a reply to another post, reddit bugged out so snipped and her's a pic.","idk 9/10 deliveries are though online portal aka companies own payment rails or stripe, not squarenever seen people carry pos to people's homes also most deliveries atm are zero contact",1,0.52,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"was originally a reply to another post, reddit bugged out so snipped and her's a pic.",Not all businesses are doing delivery though. Some are just having you drive up kind of like a Sonic.,2,0.506,0.733,POSITIVE
,"was originally a reply to another post, reddit bugged out so snipped and her's a pic.","No, that's completely wrong. I can confirm that UberEats and DoorDash deposit directly to bank accounts for any restaurant selling through them. I've helped restaurants setup their accounts for both of these services.Also, payments aren't ""facilitated"" through Square. Almost all delivery services offer their customers different ways to pay - Google Pay, Apple Pay, PayPal, Credit Card, etc. The only method that could even possible filter through SQ would be CC and that's only if they chose SQ as a payment processor which none of the major services do.Not sure where you're getting your information from.",2,0.532,1.0,NEGATIVE

,"was originally a reply to another post, reddit bugged out so snipped and her's a pic.","Here's how the POS model works. Restaurants get charged a monthly subscription fee per terminal and the cost of the hardware. SQ also makes money on the payment processing side (while competitors have to use third party services).Square offers services such as delivery integration to make their platform more attractive to customers so they won't leave for other platforms which also offer the service. The cost of the service is included in the subscription.I also think you misunderstand how integration works - SQ's POS software is able to read the information from the delivery service like items ordered, special requests, amount paid, etc. But that's all its doing - no payment processing involved. Payouts are still managed by the delivery service.",4,0.549,0.988,NEGATIVE

,"was originally a reply to another post, reddit bugged out so snipped and her's a pic.",wait really? thought a delivery app would have its own payment rails - either way I'm sure the large volume processors have really noice deals so they dont get f'kd on interchange costs,3,0.527,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"was originally a reply to another post, reddit bugged out so snipped and her's a pic.","I'd be curious to see SQ's customer breakdown. I haven't seen any large chains using SQ for PoS - always boutiques, restaurants, etc (aka companies most affected by COVID).And even if people are ""supporting local businesses"", delivery platforms use different payment processors like PayPal, Stripe, Apple Pay, GPay, etc.",0,0.512,0.725,NEGATIVE
