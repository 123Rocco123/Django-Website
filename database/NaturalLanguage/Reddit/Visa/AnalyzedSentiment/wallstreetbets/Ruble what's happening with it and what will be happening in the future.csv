,"So I've seen many people naively shorting Russian ruble, so I thought I could express some my thoughts regarding this question, as someone living in Russia and being interested in economics. Ruble's current state At MOEX (Moscow Exchange) we can buy/sell dollar for 70-72 rubles and eur for 75-78. This makes ruble technically more worth than it was before the war. There's no such thing that we're not allowed to have foreign currency, or that we pay 12-30% for buying it (it was a thing a few weeks ago, but currently cancelled). But there's still a lot of limitations... Why is it worth so much? Definitely not because our gov is playing 5 d chess. There are heavy limitations imposed, such as You can't cash out it You can't transfer money abroad (except $ 10k to your relatives or smh like that) ETFs of foreign companies are still not traded Foreigners couldn't sell their assets (from what I've seen they can now? yet to be confirmed) Russians can't buy many foreign goods Because of ban of visa and mastercard, can't pay for google pay, apple store, steam, etc. Also many flights are cancelled, so no reason to buy euro to spend in Europe if can't fly to Europe Businesses still have to sell 80% of their foreign currency income High deposit interest rates to make people prefer deposit to investing The listed limitations obviously harm the economy more than if the ruble was let floating. There are also reserves, gold, gas for rub, and probably many more which keep ruble high. Is it gonna fall? I think yes. Like I said, the central bank and gov are going to eventually loosen the exchange rate. If we look into the past, back to events of early 2014, you can check that despite sanctions, ruble only started falling on September 2014, half a year after the Crimea annexation. This means that the gov held it for some time artificially, and then, when everything was settled, let it go (from 33 rub per usd peaked to almost 70, and then bounced between 55 and 70).
