,"Provided Corona virus doesn't set the market up for another down turn and the markets continue to get propped up our Lord and Savior, J Powell. I present with you some DD. If the above holds true, fund managers, large pension funds and ETF's will need to rebalance portfolios this coming quarter. If you look at the top holdings of SPY. We can see the following top stock holdiings: Microsoft Corporation 6.01% Apple Inc. 5.74% Amazon.com, Inc. 4.67% Facebook, Inc. Class A 2.21% Alphabet Inc. Class A1.67% Alphabet Inc. Class C1.63% Johnson & Johnson1.43% Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Class B1.34% Visa Inc. Class A1.26% Procter & Gamble Company1.15% https://www.ssga.com/us/en/institutional/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy Yes, I know SPY mirrors SPX, same principle applies, just using SPY because it was easier to pull historical's. SPY holds 257 Billion. If this fund decides to move just .5% out of Microsoft they would be redistributing 1 billion amongst the lower tier stocks. Will they do this? why not? They do it regularly, the question is if enough funds and ETF's do it at once, will it boost some stock and suppress others? Back to microsoft. SPY had 81 million shares as of yesterday. What did they have last september? 84 million. https://www.ssga.com/library-content/products/fund-docs/etfs/us/ps/SPDR_500-TRUST_PROSPECTUS.pdf SPY has actually REDUCED microsoft holdings over the last year. Would they boost top holdings right now having such a massive run? if your mandate is to have a diverse portfolio, I doubt it. This trend in the SPY ETF reducing holdings over the last year is also true of Apple, and Facebook but not Amazon. Comapnies I like with low weights barring that something crazy with the virus doesn't happen and JPow's printer doesn't get jammed: Calls on :KO, PFE, INTC, MMM, RTX EDIT: A response with more details on my thoughts: I like gettin’ insulted cause it pushes me to verify the data i am posting and dig deeper. So I compiled the assets of SPY vs MSFT shares/market cap. Has there been an instance where SPY assets increased while # of shares decrease? Yes. 2009-2010, 2004-2006/07. My implication from this post is that the likelihood that hedge funds, financial advisors, mutual funds, etc... will look for returns elsewhere given that the FAANG index has had a ridiculous run over the last 10 years. One main driver of the market of recent years has been FANNG+M, and earnings expansion as part of the equation. The distortion of returns with something like RSP, DJIA vs QQQ/XLK/SPY on a YTD basis is quite remarkable. If you take out the FANNG+M out of SPY, the return is closer to the DJIA YTD number. Some of the other WSB’s picked up on this “This is the least dumb post today so it gets no love of course. But I think you’re right. Value and international have underperformed growth. I think we will see rotation from growth to value. EM should also benefit if US continues to get rona fucked.” Looking on the surface the implications that SPY and other investors are too overweight Tech screams bubble in every aspect. Of course, with the Fed printing money, who's to say it will stop? If you have a 0% risk-free rate you get TINA and FOMO, which has been happening to an extreme. Maybe those still rise and these stocks could easily rise with them. But I think is more likely to happen is the large tech companies start to level off. As this happens i believe money managers will be looking to rotate their money elsewhere in other stocks that have value. This has happened many times in the past. This chart on a percentage basis from 1999-2002. We can see plenty of instances where tech was high and Coca-Cola or RTX proceeded to outperform MSFT on a short term basis over the next quarter or couple quarters. This should present some opportunities for some calls if we get a good 20% pop on some of these stocks Why? Longer-term, stocks like RTX and MMM outperformed MSFT through the 2000 bubble crash. Clearly MSFT is different now then it was then and MSFT is one of the most reasonably valued tech comparatively. But as we face a decade of a potentially depressed economy. Could we have Value start to outperform like it did through 2000? Maybe this is all too long term thinking for WSB’s. But When looking at a comparison now. I can’t help but think we will get a pop up in some of these stocks which would make for some great call plays",So basically if the market goes up stonks go up,0,0.553,0.928,NEGATIVE

If the above holds true, fund managers, large pension funds and ETF's will need to rebalance portfolios this coming quarter. If you look at the top holdings of SPY. We can see the following top stock holdiings: Microsoft Corporation 6.01% Apple Inc. 5.74% Amazon.com, Inc. 4.67% Facebook, Inc. Class A 2.21% Alphabet Inc. Class A1.67% Alphabet Inc.

SPY holds 257 Billion. If this fund decides to move just .5% out of Microsoft they would be redistributing 1 billion amongst the lower tier stocks. Will they do this? why not? They do it regularly, the question is if enough funds and ETF's do it at once, will it boost some stock and suppress others? Back to microsoft. SPY had 81 million shares as of yesterday. What did they have last september? 84 million. https://www.ssga.com/library-content/products/fund-docs/etfs/us/ps/SPDR_500-TRUST_PROSPECTUS.pdf SPY has actually REDUCED microsoft holdings over the last year. Would they boost top holdings right now having such a massive run? if your mandate is to have a diverse portfolio, I doubt it. This trend in the SPY ETF reducing holdings over the last year is also true of Apple, and Facebook but not Amazon.

So I compiled the assets of SPY vs MSFT shares/market cap. Has there been an instance where SPY assets increased while # of shares decrease? Yes. 2009-2010, 2004-2006/07. My implication from this post is that the likelihood that hedge funds, financial advisors, mutual funds, etc... will look for returns elsewhere given that the FAANG index has had a ridiculous run over the last 10 years. One main driver of the market of recent years has been FANNG+M, and earnings expansion as part of the equation. The distortion of returns with something like RSP, DJIA vs QQQ/XLK/SPY on a YTD basis is quite remarkable. If you take out the FANNG+M out of SPY, the return is closer to the DJIA YTD number.

Of course, with the Fed printing money, who's to say it will stop? If you have a 0% risk-free rate you get TINA and FOMO, which has been happening to an extreme. Maybe those still rise and these stocks could easily rise with them. But I think is more likely to happen is the large tech companies start to level off.

This chart on a percentage basis from 1999-2002. We can see plenty of instances where tech was high and Coca-Cola or RTX proceeded to outperform MSFT on a short term basis over the next quarter or couple quarters. This should present some opportunities for some calls if we get a good 20% pop on some of these stocks Why? Longer-term, stocks like RTX and MMM outperformed MSFT through the 2000 bubble crash. Clearly MSFT is different now then it was then and MSFT is one of the most reasonably valued tech comparatively. But as we face a decade of a potentially depressed economy.
