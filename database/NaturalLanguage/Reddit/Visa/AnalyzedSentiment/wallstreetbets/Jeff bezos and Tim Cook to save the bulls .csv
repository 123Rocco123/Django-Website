How many Apple stores were closed in Q1 around the world, and how long were they closed for? Also - those 20 million+ (don‚Äôt even know the exact number anymore) without a job. How many of those people are Apple cult followers that buy phones that cost half their monthly income? I think a lot of people are going to decide that their iPhone X is just fine for the time being, and they will wait to upgrade to the 11 until there‚Äôs a little more stability/certainty in the economy.

SPY $295C 5/1 SPY $292C 5/1 V $185C 5/1 Uber $45C 6/19","Pretty much my interpretation of it too, half of my portfolio are Apple puts right now.Samsung reported -4% revenues on its mobile division, which was cushioned by better-than-expected sales of other hardware (memory chips etc.). Apple doesn't have this and -60% of its income comes directly from iPhone sales. Samsung warned its sales will be down big time for the next quarter.Sure, after Apple pulls away their guidance they'll parade the SE2 as a launch success to divert attention away from bad Q1 numbers, but isn't its success canibalizing sales of their premium line? i.e. wouldn't people who would have bought an X series going to buy a cheaper phone to save money for uncertain times? Even is the SE2 sells well I only see drop in revenues that no amount of Apple Music / Apple Arcade (lol) / Apple TV+ (rofl) will ever come close to compensate.",2,0.541,1.0,NEGATIVE
