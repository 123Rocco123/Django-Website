For example Door Dash uses it to only allow its couriers to use the card at the right restaurant at the right time to cut down on fraud. Another use case is they recently created another platform that allows companies such as Coinbase to allow customers to spend digital currencies at any place that accepts VISA. (by instantly transferring digital currencies to fiat and vice versa). Business Model: Marqeta makes money on interchange. This means they take a small percentage (0.45%) on every transaction they process. In 2020 Marqeta processed roughly $60 Billion which accounts for less than 1% of the global payments markets.

My Position: 90 shares at $25.17","This is a company that deserves a more thorough due diligence, and one that has great potential for a long-term hold. Quite surprised it hasn't received more coverage here in the past, actually.That being said... the current market cap prices in a lot of their future growth. P/S ratio is also pretty high, compared to industry average. Looking at technicals, the stock just broke support today and is likely to keep dwindling. Short interest is also relatively high (>20% of float shorted). Lock-up period expires early December for employees/shareholders, so you can expect further downward pressure as insiders offload their shares.If you factor in all these elements, the next few months could be pretty bearish for $MQ. If you're willing to enter now and hold for years, sure, go ahead. But there's probably a better entry point waiting around the corner. If you don't feel like missing out, at least try to build a position slowly over time, averaging down if necessary. Just my two cents.",0,0.551,NEGATIVE,1.0

While it’s somewhat fairly priced at these levels, I try to keep in mind that irrational pessimism always mirrors irrational exuberance. So I wouldn’t be surprised to see it trade below the $10 mark for a while.
