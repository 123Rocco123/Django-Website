,"The Vision ""Legacy"" from the 4:44 album Purpose The purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process. Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information. - Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH? - Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias? - Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable? - Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE? - Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it. An Essay on Pinterest and Social Media An Essay on KSU Railroad and Mexican-American Trade The Fundamental Constraint MOD DISCLAIMER: This post discusses B*tcoin in an academic sense. I absolutely do not intend for this post to be speculative about the asset by any means and it is solely within the context of Square's strategy, business risk, and environment. This post is about under-banking, regulatory constraints, and financial services. The Underbanking Map This one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It’s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer. A fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements. It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, trustworthiness and accountability must be established. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you’re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else. The KYC Bottleneck Just take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth. The KYC Solution It is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z. Black American Enterprise In short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem. The Underbanked Jack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted The playbook Interestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards. In my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things: - Cash App’s Twitter and advertising strategy Urban strategy Youth strategy - The geographic results on Google Trends when searching “Cash App vs. Venmo”. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty. Underbanking strategy It is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water. That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square’s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You’ve heard it before, “why doesn’t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?”. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers: The ability to start a business The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks The ability to invest and educate in B*tcoin The ability to save on basic purchases The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to) Reality What this inevitably means is that we probably won’t even see Square operating at “full-force” until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials. Speculation This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks: Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank’s regulatory offerings. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify. Square will foray into equal housing. Square will improved loan systems. Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis. Cover: https://res.cloudinary.com/eduprojectsil/image/upload/v1618730732/640x640_ryhmts.jpg",Excellent work OP.

The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process.

An Essay on Pinterest and Social Media An Essay on KSU Railroad and Mexican-American Trade The Fundamental Constraint MOD DISCLAIMER: This post discusses B*tcoin in an academic sense. I absolutely do not intend for this post to be speculative about the asset by any means and it is solely within the context of Square's strategy, business risk, and environment. This post is about under-banking, regulatory constraints, and financial services. The Underbanking Map This one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It’s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer. A fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements. It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, trustworthiness and accountability must be established. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you’re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else. The KYC Bottleneck Just take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth. The KYC Solution It is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z. Black American Enterprise In short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem. The Underbanked Jack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted The playbook Interestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards. In my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things: - Cash App’s Twitter and advertising strategy Urban strategy Youth strategy - The geographic results on Google Trends when searching “Cash App vs. Venmo”. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty. Underbanking strategy It is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water. That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square’s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You’ve heard it before, “why doesn’t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?”. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers: The ability to start a business The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks The ability to invest and educate in B*tcoin The ability to save on basic purchases The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to) Reality What this inevitably means is that we probably won’t even see Square operating at “full-force” until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials.

Paypal didn't get banking licenses because they wanted to be a bank, after all. The wildcard here is actually the EU, who have been quite proactive with their PSD/PSD2, which is establishing de-facto global standards. A lot depends on their regulation.It's an interesting time. The regulatory push for Real Time Payments is stressing financial networks and systems that are not designed around it - in particular it means a massive increase in the number of low-value transactions is hammering the daylights out of backend systems that are struggling to scale. This has lead to a market opportunity for payment aggregators. The big card networks are having to try and evolve really quickly which is putting stress everywhere, and in the US the way the card business is structured has led to a position where the retail incumbents are very vulnerable because the market division means that the stakeholders spend too long arguing who should pay to support new paradigms (which is why the EMV situation in the US is such a disaster).A good example was Venmo scaring the hell out of the major banks in the US so they created Zelle in record time.As an aside and strictly in the context of fintech, at some point the b-chain has to interact with a known customer (in a regulatory sense) or it will not be usable for purchases or payments in its current form. The Coin That Shall Not Be Named has structural issues that make it useless as a retail currency anyway and the technology is moving quickly - my guess is that it will be superseded at some point in the next decade.",2,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0

A fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements. It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, trustworthiness and accountability must be established. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you’re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else. The KYC Bottleneck Just take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth. The KYC Solution It is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z. Black American Enterprise In short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem. The Underbanked Jack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted The playbook Interestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards. In my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things: - Cash App’s Twitter and advertising strategy Urban strategy Youth strategy - The geographic results on Google Trends when searching “Cash App vs. Venmo”. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty. Underbanking strategy It is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water. That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square’s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You’ve heard it before, “why doesn’t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?”. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers: The ability to start a business The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks The ability to invest and educate in B*tcoin The ability to save on basic purchases The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to) Reality What this inevitably means is that we probably won’t even see Square operating at “full-force” until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials. Speculation This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks: Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank’s regulatory offerings. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify. Square will foray into equal housing. Square will improved loan systems. Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis. Cover: https://res.cloudinary.com/eduprojectsil/image/upload/v1618730732/640x640_ryhmts.jpg","Quality, thank you 🙏🏻",0,0.517,POSITIVE,0.997

An Essay on Pinterest and Social Media An Essay on KSU Railroad and Mexican-American Trade The Fundamental Constraint MOD DISCLAIMER: This post discusses B*tcoin in an academic sense. I absolutely do not intend for this post to be speculative about the asset by any means and it is solely within the context of Square's strategy, business risk, and environment. This post is about under-banking, regulatory constraints, and financial services. The Underbanking Map This one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It’s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer. A fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements. It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, trustworthiness and accountability must be established. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you’re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else. The KYC Bottleneck Just take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth. The KYC Solution It is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z. Black American Enterprise In short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem. The Underbanked Jack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted The playbook Interestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards. In my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things: - Cash App’s Twitter and advertising strategy Urban strategy Youth strategy - The geographic results on Google Trends when searching “Cash App vs. Venmo”. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty. Underbanking strategy It is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water. That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square’s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You’ve heard it before, “why doesn’t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?”. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers: The ability to start a business The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks The ability to invest and educate in B*tcoin The ability to save on basic purchases The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to) Reality What this inevitably means is that we probably won’t even see Square operating at “full-force” until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials. Speculation This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks: Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank’s regulatory offerings. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify. Square will foray into equal housing. Square will improved loan systems. Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis. Cover: https://res.cloudinary.com/eduprojectsil/image/upload/v1618730732/640x640_ryhmts.jpg",What am I promoting? I can just edit that part out.

,"The Vision ""Legacy"" from the 4:44 album Purpose The purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process. Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information. - Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH? - Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias? - Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable? - Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE? - Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it. An Essay on Pinterest and Social Media An Essay on KSU Railroad and Mexican-American Trade The Fundamental Constraint MOD DISCLAIMER: This post discusses B*tcoin in an academic sense. I absolutely do not intend for this post to be speculative about the asset by any means and it is solely within the context of Square's strategy, business risk, and environment. This post is about under-banking, regulatory constraints, and financial services. The Underbanking Map This one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It’s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer. A fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements. It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, trustworthiness and accountability must be established. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you’re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else. The KYC Bottleneck Just take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth. The KYC Solution It is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z. Black American Enterprise In short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem. The Underbanked Jack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted The playbook Interestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards. In my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things: - Cash App’s Twitter and advertising strategy Urban strategy Youth strategy - The geographic results on Google Trends when searching “Cash App vs. Venmo”. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty. Underbanking strategy It is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water. That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square’s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You’ve heard it before, “why doesn’t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?”. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers: The ability to start a business The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks The ability to invest and educate in B*tcoin The ability to save on basic purchases The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to) Reality What this inevitably means is that we probably won’t even see Square operating at “full-force” until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials. Speculation This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks: Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank’s regulatory offerings. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard.

It offers: The ability to start a business The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks The ability to invest and educate in B*tcoin The ability to save on basic purchases The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to) Reality What this inevitably means is that we probably won’t even see Square operating at “full-force” until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials. Speculation This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks: Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank’s regulatory offerings. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify. Square will foray into equal housing. Square will improved loan systems. Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis. Cover: https://res.cloudinary.com/eduprojectsil/image/upload/v1618730732/640x640_ryhmts.jpg",,8,,,
,"The Vision ""Legacy"" from the 4:44 album Purpose The purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.

An Essay on Pinterest and Social Media An Essay on KSU Railroad and Mexican-American Trade The Fundamental Constraint MOD DISCLAIMER: This post discusses B*tcoin in an academic sense. I absolutely do not intend for this post to be speculative about the asset by any means and it is solely within the context of Square's strategy, business risk, and environment. This post is about under-banking, regulatory constraints, and financial services. The Underbanking Map This one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It’s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer. A fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements. It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, trustworthiness and accountability must be established. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you’re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else. The KYC Bottleneck Just take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth. The KYC Solution It is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z. Black American Enterprise In short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem. The Underbanked Jack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted The playbook Interestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards. In my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things: - Cash App’s Twitter and advertising strategy Urban strategy Youth strategy - The geographic results on Google Trends when searching “Cash App vs. Venmo”. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty. Underbanking strategy It is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water. That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square’s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org.

Speculation This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks: Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank’s regulatory offerings. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify. Square will foray into equal housing. Square will improved loan systems.

An Essay on Pinterest and Social Media An Essay on KSU Railroad and Mexican-American Trade The Fundamental Constraint MOD DISCLAIMER: This post discusses B*tcoin in an academic sense. I absolutely do not intend for this post to be speculative about the asset by any means and it is solely within the context of Square's strategy, business risk, and environment. This post is about under-banking, regulatory constraints, and financial services. The Underbanking Map This one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It’s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer. A fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements. It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, trustworthiness and accountability must be established. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you’re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else. The KYC Bottleneck Just take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth. The KYC Solution It is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z. Black American Enterprise In short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem. The Underbanked Jack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted The playbook Interestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards. In my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked.

Speculation This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks: Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank’s regulatory offerings.

The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard.

I absolutely do not intend for this post to be speculative about the asset by any means and it is solely within the context of Square's strategy, business risk, and environment. This post is about under-banking, regulatory constraints, and financial services. The Underbanking Map This one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It’s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer. A fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements. It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector.

These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you’re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else. The KYC Bottleneck Just take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse.

These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth. The KYC Solution It is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak.

The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction.

The Underbanked Jack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted The playbook Interestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner.

In my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers.

Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty. Underbanking strategy It is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water. That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square’s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You’ve heard it before, “why doesn’t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?”. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers: The ability to start a business The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks The ability to invest and educate in B*tcoin The ability to save on basic purchases The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to) Reality What this inevitably means is that we probably won’t even see Square operating at “full-force” until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials. Speculation This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks: Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank’s regulatory offerings. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify. Square will foray into equal housing. Square will improved loan systems. Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis. Cover: https://res.cloudinary.com/eduprojectsil/image/upload/v1618730732/640x640_ryhmts.jpg",Thank you!!,1,0.495,POSITIVE,0.923

This post is about under-banking, regulatory constraints, and financial services. The Underbanking Map This one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable.

These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy.

There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless.

Speculation This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks: Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank’s regulatory offerings. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify. Square will foray into equal housing. Square will improved loan systems. Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis. Cover: https://res.cloudinary.com/eduprojectsil/image/upload/v1618730732/640x640_ryhmts.jpg","Mmm.

An Essay on Pinterest and Social Media An Essay on KSU Railroad and Mexican-American Trade The Fundamental Constraint MOD DISCLAIMER: This post discusses B*tcoin in an academic sense. I absolutely do not intend for this post to be speculative about the asset by any means and it is solely within the context of Square's strategy, business risk, and environment. This post is about under-banking, regulatory constraints, and financial services. The Underbanking Map This one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It’s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer. A fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements. It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, trustworthiness and accountability must be established. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you’re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else. The KYC Bottleneck Just take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth. The KYC Solution It is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z. Black American Enterprise In short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem. The Underbanked Jack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted The playbook Interestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards. In my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things: - Cash App’s Twitter and advertising strategy Urban strategy Youth strategy - The geographic results on Google Trends when searching “Cash App vs. Venmo”. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty. Underbanking strategy It is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water. That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square’s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You’ve heard it before, “why doesn’t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?”. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers: The ability to start a business The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks The ability to invest and educate in B*tcoin The ability to save on basic purchases The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to) Reality What this inevitably means is that we probably won’t even see Square operating at “full-force” until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials. Speculation This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks: Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank’s regulatory offerings. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify. Square will foray into equal housing. Square will improved loan systems. Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis. Cover: https://res.cloudinary.com/eduprojectsil/image/upload/v1618730732/640x640_ryhmts.jpg",I'd subscribe to DD like this.,0,0.513,NEGATIVE,1.0

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information. - Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH? - Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias? - Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable? - Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE? - Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?

An Essay on Pinterest and Social Media An Essay on KSU Railroad and Mexican-American Trade The Fundamental Constraint MOD DISCLAIMER: This post discusses B*tcoin in an academic sense. I absolutely do not intend for this post to be speculative about the asset by any means and it is solely within the context of Square's strategy, business risk, and environment. This post is about under-banking, regulatory constraints, and financial services. The Underbanking Map This one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It’s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer. A fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements. It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, trustworthiness and accountability must be established. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you’re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else. The KYC Bottleneck Just take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth. The KYC Solution It is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z. Black American Enterprise In short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem. The Underbanked Jack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted The playbook Interestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards. In my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things: - Cash App’s Twitter and advertising strategy Urban strategy Youth strategy - The geographic results on Google Trends when searching “Cash App vs. Venmo”. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty. Underbanking strategy It is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water. That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square’s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You’ve heard it before, “why doesn’t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?”. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers: The ability to start a business The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks The ability to invest and educate in B*tcoin The ability to save on basic purchases The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to) Reality What this inevitably means is that we probably won’t even see Square operating at “full-force” until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials. Speculation This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks: Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank’s regulatory offerings. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify. Square will foray into equal housing. Square will improved loan systems. Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis.

Very few young people still use TWTR, many fled to Snapchat and Instagram even for basic messaging, not just selling bunghole pics. We have seen the rise (and fall) of many alternatives to the BBS/forum models, which let's be honest have been brutally attacked at all levels from payment processing to DNS hosting for daring not to be socially regulated by the woke mob. Just keep that thought in mind about the youth, they're the least loyal of any demographic, they will switch to a new system if they think it's too mainstream, or the new one is cooler for whatever (marketing) reason.Square may lead the way, but the winner seems less certain, the process Jack et al take to get from tech to bank can be done in reverse very quickly, bank to tech, the only thing currently missing is the ethos and expertise. Banks tend to play ""safe"" when it comes to deploying tech, though funny enough make a lot of really bad investments like lending to people who can't pay, so it's going to be interesting to see if they can wrap their heads around it.

No really, go ahead and look at two things: - Cash App’s Twitter and advertising strategy Urban strategy Youth strategy - The geographic results on Google Trends when searching “Cash App vs. Venmo”. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty. Underbanking strategy It is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water. That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square’s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You’ve heard it before, “why doesn’t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?”. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers: The ability to start a business The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks The ability to invest and educate in B*tcoin The ability to save on basic purchases The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to) Reality What this inevitably means is that we probably won’t even see Square operating at “full-force” until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials. Speculation This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks: Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank’s regulatory offerings. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify. Square will foray into equal housing. Square will improved loan systems. Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis. Cover: https://res.cloudinary.com/eduprojectsil/image/upload/v1618730732/640x640_ryhmts.jpg","Great analysis, nice work.

,"The Vision ""Legacy"" from the 4:44 album Purpose The purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process. Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information. - Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH? - Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias? - Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable? - Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE? - Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it. An Essay on Pinterest and Social Media An Essay on KSU Railroad and Mexican-American Trade The Fundamental Constraint MOD DISCLAIMER: This post discusses B*tcoin in an academic sense. I absolutely do not intend for this post to be speculative about the asset by any means and it is solely within the context of Square's strategy, business risk, and environment. This post is about under-banking, regulatory constraints, and financial services. The Underbanking Map This one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It’s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer. A fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements. It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, trustworthiness and accountability must be established. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you’re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else. The KYC Bottleneck Just take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth. The KYC Solution It is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z. Black American Enterprise In short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem.
