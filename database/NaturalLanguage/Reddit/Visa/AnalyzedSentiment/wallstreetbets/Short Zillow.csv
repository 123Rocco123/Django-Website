,I am thinking of shorting Zillow . Z had a high of 63.57 on July 13th. It tumbled down to 28.07 and now at 50.62. I think non resident Chinese buyers have visa restrictions due to Coronavirus and house inventory in many cities is at all time high. Do you think Zillow will tumble again ?,"To understand why this is unlikely, you have to understand why Zillow tumbled down to 28 in the first place. Basically, the issue was that in the month of July, the ""Full House"" deluxe box set was released, which created a negative conception of houses as being overcrowded. This shook the demand for houses and lead to a significant drop in investor confidence. Now the Corona virus doesn't have the word house anywhere in the name, so I can only assume it will have absolutely no effect on Zillow stock prices.",0,0.519,1.0,NEGATIVE

The only advantage Zillow has is that their interface is easy to use. Also, these retards are trying to flip houses now.Easy short. Eisman & Burry aren't wrong on this one.
