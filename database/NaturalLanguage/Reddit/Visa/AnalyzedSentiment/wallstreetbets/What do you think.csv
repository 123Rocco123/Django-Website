The sovereign wealth funds e.g. PIF, Mubadala, QIA have some insane investments and basically bankrolled a good portion of silicon valley. They have some insane RE holdings globally particularly in London / NYC.I remember back during COVID, port valuations dropped and UAE bought ownership in large global ports through DP World.
