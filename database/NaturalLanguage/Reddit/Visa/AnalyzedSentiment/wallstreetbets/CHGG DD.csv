,"Chegg is known by everybody who goes to college. Company has amazing financials last 5 years and only steady growth. Online learning will just amplifiy chegg and with foreign students who have student visas having to go back to their country if there is online classes, chgg will just spread. Even on previous earning call they mentioned how they seeing surge in international usage. I've analayzed their financials before their last earnings when they went up like 40% which you can see here https://imgur.com/a/pCxjflI This does not include their most recent earnings report as I didn't update but im 90% sure the numbers are correct. In 1 week (2 max) they will announce date for their Q2 earnings which will be late July. I plan on holding through earnings cause I have so much faith in them but if you want to buy now and sell before earnings you could make easy money. I think long calls are perfect for this company. I will be putting more than 10k into this.. I think long term they are good because they are expanding their services, adding more tutors etc so think people will use for more than just ""homework"" especially if they have online learning and can't go see a teacher at campus for help. The hardest part is finding what the stock is worth as it jumped so much last earnings and the chart is crazy. But I do think it has hugeee potential. Gonna post the same shit on WSB in a few days so probably best to buy now since last time I made a DD on a stock before buying in on WSB premiums rose over 50% lmao. Another stock which I planning on doing research on before buying is $TWOU, online degree program and with schools charging same tuition but going fully online classes (harvard) think they have huge potential.

Online learning will just amplifiy chegg and with foreign students who have student visas having to go back to their country if there is online classes, chgg will just spread. Even on previous earning call they mentioned how they seeing surge in international usage. I've analayzed their financials before their last earnings when they went up like 40% which you can see here https://imgur.com/a/pCxjflI This does not include their most recent earnings report as I didn't update but im 90% sure the numbers are correct. In 1 week (2 max) they will announce date for their Q2 earnings which will be late July. I plan on holding through earnings cause I have so much faith in them but if you want to buy now and sell before earnings you could make easy money. I think long calls are perfect for this company. I will be putting more than 10k into this.. I think long term they are good because they are expanding their services, adding more tutors etc so think people will use for more than just ""homework"" especially if they have online learning and can't go see a teacher at campus for help. The hardest part is finding what the stock is worth as it jumped so much last earnings and the chart is crazy. But I do think it has hugeee potential. Gonna post the same shit on WSB in a few days so probably best to buy now since last time I made a DD on a stock before buying in on WSB premiums rose over 50% lmao. Another stock which I planning on doing research on before buying is $TWOU, online degree program and with schools charging same tuition but going fully online classes (harvard) think they have huge potential. What happend last time I posted a chgg DD https://imgur.com/a/rruVCcp","They usually announce earnings day around the the 11th of july and have the earnings end of july, so if they continue the pattern they should announce within a week and have at end of july. my PT I don't know but I'm thinking of buying 25% + calls",1,0.568,0.95,NEGATIVE
