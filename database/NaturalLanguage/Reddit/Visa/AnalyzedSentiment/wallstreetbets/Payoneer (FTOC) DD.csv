,"Payoneer (FTOC) The majority of my DD was based on the company’s IR presentation (link). IMHO the key for the company is to explain the customer ROI at the unit level and why investments now make sense from a CLTV sense. The company also needs to address flattish margins on 25% revenue growth and negative EBITDA after 15 years of operations. That said, this looks like a great LT hold if they don't get taken out first. The acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021. Summary: Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at an attractive entry point. What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team know what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position. Company: Payoneer, acquired by FTOC (SPAC), provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world). Customers: Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network. Industry and market opportunity: B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, “scale” and “network effects”. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they’re benefitting from these dynamics. Analysts estimate the global B2B market at over a trillion $ and cross-border payments at $300mn. Obviously, the pandemic only accelerated these trends. Management team: Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at Mastercard and First Data. Business model: Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and is expected to grow at 38% in 2021 and 2022, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth for the next two years. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed. While the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn’t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I’m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins. I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition. Valuation: The transaction assumes an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. This multiple is in-line with global processors but well below digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Note: there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark. Additionally, the transaction includes a $300mn PIPE. Investment Thesis 1. Majority of traffic stays within the network. In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer. 2. Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends. As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated. 3. Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate. The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky. 4. Playing the long game. The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Expect M&A to figure into the company’s strategic plans as well. 5. Attractive valuation: Payoneer’s valuation is in-line with global processors but well below digital payment and ecommerce companies. This company’s valuation multiple will likely change as the business becomes better known within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more a when rather than if issue. Risks: Competition: Paypal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling Mastercard. Skrill is also well known in this space. Mastercard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don’t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here. Cusomter risk. Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo). Regulatory: Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become. Europe is trying to displace MA and V. FX exposure. I’m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure. TLDR: Payoneer is a proven company in a great space with a solid management team that is playing the long-game. IMHO, it is shaping up to be a very attractive investment for LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that more DD is needed around competition and the business model. ******************** I am not a financial advisor.
