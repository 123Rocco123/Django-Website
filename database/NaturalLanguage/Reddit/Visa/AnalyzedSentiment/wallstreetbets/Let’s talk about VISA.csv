,"Apart from the growth of online transaction in the recent months and continued growth in the months ahead, I’ve been thinking about the EDD unemployment insurance compensation in relation to VISA numbers. There are currently 26M unemployment and counting. Unemployment insurance claims are putting out on average $340-350 per week, and on top of this, a majority will quality for an additional $600 per week for just being unemployed. It seems that a majority if not all of these transactions are released in the form on a VISA Debit card. If I just roughly do some retard math, the minimum monthly amount in those VISA cards would be in the $35 Billion per month into these accounts. And no I didn’t account for the $600 addendum, which even if 50% of the unemployed qualified, it would be close to an additional $31B per month. That’s a grand total of $66B per month loaded into VISA debit accounts, which on a span on say 5-6 months of unemployment, would be worth $330B-360B for the next two quarters. Now granted, not all of the money will be used as I assume people will hoard some of it, but even 30% consumption would equate to close to 100B in added transactions for the next two quarters. What do you guys think?",idk about you guys but my credit card spending dropped 95% last month. who the fuck is spending money on non-essential items right now? the most lucrative revenue stream for all of the credit card companies are the processing fees. less swipes = less tendies,0,0.508,1.0,NEGATIVE
