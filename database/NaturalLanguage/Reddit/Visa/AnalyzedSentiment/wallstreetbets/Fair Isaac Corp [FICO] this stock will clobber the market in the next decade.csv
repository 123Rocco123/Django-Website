,"You probably know Fair Isaac Corp. as FICO, the individual credit rating agency. I’m going to keep this DD short because I want to only focus on their Scores segment of revenue, and not the other smaller software and security solutions they offer. Those are for a post of their own. As much as the media will say that FICO scores and bad, government this that blah blah blah, the FICO score is the holy grail of consumer credit worthiness. There’s really no world that doesn’t involve running someone’s credit score before handing out a loan, and FICO has a long run algorithm that is tied to almost every individual with a bank account. The algorithm is very capital light, which means the operating cost of running this algorithm is next to nothing, and that shows itself in the whopping 80% operating margin in their scores segment, at the moment, they earn about 30% profit margin in their entire business, and that’s wild. Last year, and I’m using rounded number here, they did about 700 million in scores revenue. Their TOTAL profit margin, across all business is about 30% im going to suggest their scores profit is significantly higher because it’s just an algorithm, and needs a couple IT guys and some processing power to run. I wouldn’t be surprised if they run OVER 50% profit on their scores revenue, similar to VISA and MA as they just run a processing network. Very recently, an agreement expired that was preventing FICO from raising the prices on their credit score inquiries. Because of this recent expiration, Fico for the past couple years has been jacking up the price of having access to their algorithm. You can see this in their 10k’s where for a couple years they increased Scores revenue by 25% each year compounding. Crazy shit. This means their profit margin on this part of their business will explode, as price increases and cost stays the same. I think they are going to be careful exercising too much pricing power, but really they can charge almost whatever they want for their product. Do you know what it costs on average to run a credit score for let’s say an auto loan? About $0.05-$0.07 to the business. That right, an auto dealership that wants to run your credit will pay Fico a couple pennies to find out your credit score. Think about the value the business gets for that price. So what’s the limit here? How much can they charge for a credit score inquiry? Even if competitors arise… would a business looking to loan $50,000 pay 5 dollars to know what your credit score is? Probably, and that’s one hundred fucking times what it is now, and the cost is still a rounding error on their weekly balance sheets. This here is my main thesis for FICO. The Fico score, no matter what macro economic policies and naysayers about the quality of the score, will always be the ultimate gold standard. They have a very unique position in our economy, with a near infinite runway for growth in the score revenue. Current PE is high, but easy to justify given the runway. Some simple numbers for you smoothbrains: 20% price increase per year for 10 years will give them 6.19x current revenue or about 4.3B. Times maybe a 50% profit and 30x earnings gets them an easy 64B market cap on SCORES alone. Extrapolate this over 20 years? Forget it, you’ll knock it out of the park here. The final reason is what they’re going to do with this money… Fico now has this infinite money printer in score revenue; a low cost, high margin business that can print money for whatever business they want to fund, and that’s exactly what they’re doing. Not gonna go into that here, but the scores revenue is just a fucking money printer, the likes that hasn’t been seen since AWS or Mastercard and VISA. Even if they do 50% of whats expected they are in an extremely dominant position and their stock price justifies and reflects that. Cough up the higher earnings multiple and get in this fantastic business. EDIT: at the time of making this post, the price of FICO is $851 per share",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

However, you will not see a repeat performance as the free money borrowing days are in the past.Assuming that EPS is just going to continue skyrocketing into infinity is full blown regarded.

There’s really no world that doesn’t involve running someone’s credit score before handing out a loan, and FICO has a long run algorithm that is tied to almost every individual with a bank account. The algorithm is very capital light, which means the operating cost of running this algorithm is next to nothing, and that shows itself in the whopping 80% operating margin in their scores segment, at the moment, they earn about 30% profit margin in their entire business, and that’s wild. Last year, and I’m using rounded number here, they did about 700 million in scores revenue. Their TOTAL profit margin, across all business is about 30% im going to suggest their scores profit is significantly higher because it’s just an algorithm, and needs a couple IT guys and some processing power to run. I wouldn’t be surprised if they run OVER 50% profit on their scores revenue, similar to VISA and MA as they just run a processing network. Very recently, an agreement expired that was preventing FICO from raising the prices on their credit score inquiries. Because of this recent expiration, Fico for the past couple years has been jacking up the price of having access to their algorithm. You can see this in their 10k’s where for a couple years they increased Scores revenue by 25% each year compounding. Crazy shit. This means their profit margin on this part of their business will explode, as price increases and cost stays the same. I think they are going to be careful exercising too much pricing power, but really they can charge almost whatever they want for their product. Do you know what it costs on average to run a credit score for let’s say an auto loan? About $0.05-$0.07 to the business. That right, an auto dealership that wants to run your credit will pay Fico a couple pennies to find out your credit score. Think about the value the business gets for that price. So what’s the limit here? How much can they charge for a credit score inquiry? Even if competitors arise… would a business looking to loan $50,000 pay 5 dollars to know what your credit score is? Probably, and that’s one hundred fucking times what it is now, and the cost is still a rounding error on their weekly balance sheets. This here is my main thesis for FICO. The Fico score, no matter what macro economic policies and naysayers about the quality of the score, will always be the ultimate gold standard. They have a very unique position in our economy, with a near infinite runway for growth in the score revenue. Current PE is high, but easy to justify given the runway.

They have a very unique position in our economy, with a near infinite runway for growth in the score revenue. Current PE is high, but easy to justify given the runway. Some simple numbers for you smoothbrains: 20% price increase per year for 10 years will give them 6.19x current revenue or about 4.3B. Times maybe a 50% profit and 30x earnings gets them an easy 64B market cap on SCORES alone. Extrapolate this over 20 years? Forget it, you’ll knock it out of the park here. The final reason is what they’re going to do with this money… Fico now has this infinite money printer in score revenue; a low cost, high margin business that can print money for whatever business they want to fund, and that’s exactly what they’re doing. Not gonna go into that here, but the scores revenue is just a fucking money printer, the likes that hasn’t been seen since AWS or Mastercard and VISA. Even if they do 50% of whats expected they are in an extremely dominant position and their stock price justifies and reflects that.

Last year, and I’m using rounded number here, they did about 700 million in scores revenue.

That right, an auto dealership that wants to run your credit will pay Fico a couple pennies to find out your credit score. Think about the value the business gets for that price.

A significant portion of our revenues in our Scores segment is attributable to the U.S. mortgage market, which includes, for mortgages eligible for purchase by The Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), a requirement by those enterprises that U.S. lenders provide FICO® Scores for each mortgage delivered to them. However, their continued use of the FICO Score is currently subject to validation and approval by those enterprises and the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

I wouldn’t be surprised if they run OVER 50% profit on their scores revenue, similar to VISA and MA as they just run a processing network. Very recently, an agreement expired that was preventing FICO from raising the prices on their credit score inquiries. Because of this recent expiration, Fico for the past couple years has been jacking up the price of having access to their algorithm. You can see this in their 10k’s where for a couple years they increased Scores revenue by 25% each year compounding. Crazy shit. This means their profit margin on this part of their business will explode, as price increases and cost stays the same. I think they are going to be careful exercising too much pricing power, but really they can charge almost whatever they want for their product. Do you know what it costs on average to run a credit score for let’s say an auto loan? About $0.05-$0.07 to the business. That right, an auto dealership that wants to run your credit will pay Fico a couple pennies to find out your credit score. Think about the value the business gets for that price. So what’s the limit here? How much can they charge for a credit score inquiry? Even if competitors arise… would a business looking to loan $50,000 pay 5 dollars to know what your credit score is? Probably, and that’s one hundred fucking times what it is now, and the cost is still a rounding error on their weekly balance sheets. This here is my main thesis for FICO. The Fico score, no matter what macro economic policies and naysayers about the quality of the score, will always be the ultimate gold standard. They have a very unique position in our economy, with a near infinite runway for growth in the score revenue. Current PE is high, but easy to justify given the runway. Some simple numbers for you smoothbrains: 20% price increase per year for 10 years will give them 6.19x current revenue or about 4.3B. Times maybe a 50% profit and 30x earnings gets them an easy 64B market cap on SCORES alone. Extrapolate this over 20 years? Forget it, you’ll knock it out of the park here. The final reason is what they’re going to do with this money… Fico now has this infinite money printer in score revenue; a low cost, high margin business that can print money for whatever business they want to fund, and that’s exactly what they’re doing. Not gonna go into that here, but the scores revenue is just a fucking money printer, the likes that hasn’t been seen since AWS or Mastercard and VISA.

I wouldn’t be surprised if they run OVER 50% profit on their scores revenue, similar to VISA and MA as they just run a processing network. Very recently, an agreement expired that was preventing FICO from raising the prices on their credit score inquiries. Because of this recent expiration, Fico for the past couple years has been jacking up the price of having access to their algorithm. You can see this in their 10k’s where for a couple years they increased Scores revenue by 25% each year compounding. Crazy shit. This means their profit margin on this part of their business will explode, as price increases and cost stays the same. I think they are going to be careful exercising too much pricing power, but really they can charge almost whatever they want for their product. Do you know what it costs on average to run a credit score for let’s say an auto loan? About $0.05-$0.07 to the business. That right, an auto dealership that wants to run your credit will pay Fico a couple pennies to find out your credit score. Think about the value the business gets for that price. So what’s the limit here? How much can they charge for a credit score inquiry? Even if competitors arise… would a business looking to loan $50,000 pay 5 dollars to know what your credit score is? Probably, and that’s one hundred fucking times what it is now, and the cost is still a rounding error on their weekly balance sheets. This here is my main thesis for FICO. The Fico score, no matter what macro economic policies and naysayers about the quality of the score, will always be the ultimate gold standard. They have a very unique position in our economy, with a near infinite runway for growth in the score revenue. Current PE is high, but easy to justify given the runway. Some simple numbers for you smoothbrains: 20% price increase per year for 10 years will give them 6.19x current revenue or about 4.3B. Times maybe a 50% profit and 30x earnings gets them an easy 64B market cap on SCORES alone. Extrapolate this over 20 years? Forget it, you’ll knock it out of the park here. The final reason is what they’re going to do with this money… Fico now has this infinite money printer in score revenue; a low cost, high margin business that can print money for whatever business they want to fund, and that’s exactly what they’re doing. Not gonna go into that here, but the scores revenue is just a fucking money printer, the likes that hasn’t been seen since AWS or Mastercard and VISA. Even if they do 50% of whats expected they are in an extremely dominant position and their stock price justifies and reflects that.

Those are for a post of their own. As much as the media will say that FICO scores and bad, government this that blah blah blah, the FICO score is the holy grail of consumer credit worthiness. There’s really no world that doesn’t involve running someone’s credit score before handing out a loan, and FICO has a long run algorithm that is tied to almost every individual with a bank account. The algorithm is very capital light, which means the operating cost of running this algorithm is next to nothing, and that shows itself in the whopping 80% operating margin in their scores segment, at the moment, they earn about 30% profit margin in their entire business, and that’s wild. Last year, and I’m using rounded number here, they did about 700 million in scores revenue. Their TOTAL profit margin, across all business is about 30% im going to suggest their scores profit is significantly higher because it’s just an algorithm, and needs a couple IT guys and some processing power to run. I wouldn’t be surprised if they run OVER 50% profit on their scores revenue, similar to VISA and MA as they just run a processing network. Very recently, an agreement expired that was preventing FICO from raising the prices on their credit score inquiries. Because of this recent expiration, Fico for the past couple years has been jacking up the price of having access to their algorithm. You can see this in their 10k’s where for a couple years they increased Scores revenue by 25% each year compounding. Crazy shit.

I think they are going to be careful exercising too much pricing power, but really they can charge almost whatever they want for their product. Do you know what it costs on average to run a credit score for let’s say an auto loan? About $0.05-$0.07 to the business. That right, an auto dealership that wants to run your credit will pay Fico a couple pennies to find out your credit score. Think about the value the business gets for that price. So what’s the limit here? How much can they charge for a credit score inquiry? Even if competitors arise… would a business looking to loan $50,000 pay 5 dollars to know what your credit score is? Probably, and that’s one hundred fucking times what it is now, and the cost is still a rounding error on their weekly balance sheets. This here is my main thesis for FICO. The Fico score, no matter what macro economic policies and naysayers about the quality of the score, will always be the ultimate gold standard. They have a very unique position in our economy, with a near infinite runway for growth in the score revenue. Current PE is high, but easy to justify given the runway. Some simple numbers for you smoothbrains: 20% price increase per year for 10 years will give them 6.19x current revenue or about 4.3B. Times maybe a 50% profit and 30x earnings gets them an easy 64B market cap on SCORES alone. Extrapolate this over 20 years? Forget it, you’ll knock it out of the park here. The final reason is what they’re going to do with this money… Fico now has this infinite money printer in score revenue; a low cost, high margin business that can print money for whatever business they want to fund, and that’s exactly what they’re doing.

This is a monster business with lots of runway for growth in scores alone, and their software side provides the other half of their revenue with margins that are likely to improve in the next 5 to 10 years as the major capex has been spent already. Some investment is still required in software that they touched in in the most recent earnings call, but I doubt we see it play out similarly to big tech who have to overpay for acquisitions and SBC for employees.Adding to this is that I think emerging markets will need credit to sustain high growth rates, especially India, and FICO has been marketing heavily in India to get banks into FICO Platform. Falcon is also a powerhouse global solution in the fraud space, and many think we are in a golden age of fraud, it could mean that any company that offers good detection and defense will make a killing.You can come up with some insane valuations for this company. Another consideration is that they have a relatively low market cap, and everyone is starting to think their assets are amazing (and they are) so there could be some big overpay acquisition from a massive financial institution or big tech company at some point.",0,0.551,POSITIVE,0.987

This means their profit margin on this part of their business will explode, as price increases and cost stays the same. I think they are going to be careful exercising too much pricing power, but really they can charge almost whatever they want for their product. Do you know what it costs on average to run a credit score for let’s say an auto loan? About $0.05-$0.07 to the business. That right, an auto dealership that wants to run your credit will pay Fico a couple pennies to find out your credit score. Think about the value the business gets for that price. So what’s the limit here? How much can they charge for a credit score inquiry? Even if competitors arise… would a business looking to loan $50,000 pay 5 dollars to know what your credit score is? Probably, and that’s one hundred fucking times what it is now, and the cost is still a rounding error on their weekly balance sheets. This here is my main thesis for FICO. The Fico score, no matter what macro economic policies and naysayers about the quality of the score, will always be the ultimate gold standard. They have a very unique position in our economy, with a near infinite runway for growth in the score revenue. Current PE is high, but easy to justify given the runway. Some simple numbers for you smoothbrains: 20% price increase per year for 10 years will give them 6.19x current revenue or about 4.3B. Times maybe a 50% profit and 30x earnings gets them an easy 64B market cap on SCORES alone. Extrapolate this over 20 years? Forget it, you’ll knock it out of the park here. The final reason is what they’re going to do with this money… Fico now has this infinite money printer in score revenue; a low cost, high margin business that can print money for whatever business they want to fund, and that’s exactly what they’re doing. Not gonna go into that here, but the scores revenue is just a fucking money printer, the likes that hasn’t been seen since AWS or Mastercard and VISA. Even if they do 50% of whats expected they are in an extremely dominant position and their stock price justifies and reflects that. Cough up the higher earnings multiple and get in this fantastic business. EDIT: at the time of making this post, the price of FICO is $851 per share",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"You probably know Fair Isaac Corp. as FICO, the individual credit rating agency. I’m going to keep this DD short because I want to only focus on their Scores segment of revenue, and not the other smaller software and security solutions they offer. Those are for a post of their own. As much as the media will say that FICO scores and bad, government this that blah blah blah, the FICO score is the holy grail of consumer credit worthiness. There’s really no world that doesn’t involve running someone’s credit score before handing out a loan, and FICO has a long run algorithm that is tied to almost every individual with a bank account. The algorithm is very capital light, which means the operating cost of running this algorithm is next to nothing, and that shows itself in the whopping 80% operating margin in their scores segment, at the moment, they earn about 30% profit margin in their entire business, and that’s wild. Last year, and I’m using rounded number here, they did about 700 million in scores revenue. Their TOTAL profit margin, across all business is about 30% im going to suggest their scores profit is significantly higher because it’s just an algorithm, and needs a couple IT guys and some processing power to run. I wouldn’t be surprised if they run OVER 50% profit on their scores revenue, similar to VISA and MA as they just run a processing network.
