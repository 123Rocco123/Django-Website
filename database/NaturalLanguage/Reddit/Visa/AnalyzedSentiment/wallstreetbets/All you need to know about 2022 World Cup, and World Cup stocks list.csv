I guess it's also cool that the middle east got a world cup, even though I think it was rigged. As far as successful we will see, fifa giving instant yellow card to teams having the LGBTQ representation on their kits doesn't show that Qatar is willing to adapt. It shows that FIFA is weak and caves to pressure. They did it with the beer ban two days before the event. I lived there for a year back in 2021, and the way they treat people that don't look like them is really questionable. The migrant workers were basically walked all over, minimal breaks while working and only one day off while receiving minimal pay. McDonald's is not really prevalent their as the locals qataris don't eat there since they got fck u money. I also predict that the Qatar national team is not making it out of the group stage, but hey maybe I'm wrong. I wish them and the tournament the best of luck though.",1,0.528,NEGATIVE,0.963
