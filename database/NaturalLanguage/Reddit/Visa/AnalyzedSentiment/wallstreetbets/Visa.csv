Thanks for your time","OK so you simultaneously sell a put at $132 for the last sold price of 89c and buy the $130 put for the last sold price of 56c. The difference is 33c so the contract will net $33 in premium. As long as the stock remains above $131.67 we keep the $33. If it goes below that we're out $200 (distance of the spread x $100).The POP right now on TOS is 93.75%. That's not an exact number, stocks don't entirely conform to a normal distribution, but it's a useful number we can use. If we treat the trade as a binomial probability problem we take the probability of profit (93.75%), multiply it by the potential profit ($33), then subtract the probability of loss (6.25%) multiplied by the loss ($200). We end up with an expected value of $18.43 for the trade.So we have a trade that has high probability of success and a trade that's profitable in aggregate. It's most probably a good trade to make.",2,0.544,0.999,NEGATIVE

Bought MSFT calls, left and came back to a 100% gain.V Play that I sold early, but I have more in my TDA so I'm good.I also have SPY calls, SPCE, NFLX expiring 1/24.Point is forget shares for now. You're probably 20 or 21 or younger? You can take some risks. Buy some calls or puts. OR spreads if you want to play it safe. You'll make that 10%+ gain in no time.",0,0.535,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I’m gonna buy 1 share of visa, some of the reasons are: • It’s a good long term share to hold •They have (what I think) are good dividends •Safest stock to invest in as it basically has never dipped • It’s in my price range ($10-$250) •I don’t need to check up on it too much I’m open to advice, if anyone has anything similar for less(price wise) or better. Thanks for your time",happy cake day motherfucker,1,0.52,0.923,POSITIVE
