US Commerce March Durable Goods Orders increased by 3.2%, exceeding the consensus estimate of 0.5%. This surprise beat was almost completely due to Boeing's big order form Air India (Nondefense aircraft new orders increased by 78.4%). Capital goods orders, nondefense, excluding aircraft (represented by the blue line) actually decreased 0.4% month-over-month, vs. estimated 0.1% decrease. Shipments, nondefense, excluding aircraft (represented by the orange line), decreased by 0.4% compared to the estimated increase of 0.1%. The AtlantaFed revised its Q1 GDP forecast to 1.1%, down from 2.5% the previous week, just one day before the GDP release. Have they all gone vaca for the past 3 weeks?

A song of ice and fire. Hilton beat both the top and bottom line and raised its full-year guidance, indicating strong consumer spending on travel services. Visa reported similar findings, noting that ticket sizes were declining as inflation moderates, but growth remains strong in services, travel, and entertainment. Outbound travel from the US to all geographies remained strong at around 150% of 2019 levels, indicating that the consumer is still in good shape. While the service sector seems to be still strong, transportation (indicator for goods orders) has been leading the decline. Dow Jones transportation index dropped 1000 points in 2 days.

My personal take on earnings is that growth is very limited down the road. MAU barely moved while ARPU declined, and more importantly, operating margins were down significantly (31% to 25%) yoy, highlighting challenges from both competition and economic uncertainty. Reality Lab should be shut down completely, as it’s still struggling for direction after years of exploration. Finding new revenue is a must for Meta; it might as well completely pivot to AI.

,"Been running around all day. This is going to be a short one. The Economy TLDR, more mixed signals from durable goods data suggest a slowing economy, in line with other data this week. US Commerce March Durable Goods Orders increased by 3.2%, exceeding the consensus estimate of 0.5%. This surprise beat was almost completely due to Boeing's big order form Air India (Nondefense aircraft new orders increased by 78.4%). Capital goods orders, nondefense, excluding aircraft (represented by the blue line) actually decreased 0.4% month-over-month, vs. estimated 0.1% decrease. Shipments, nondefense, excluding aircraft (represented by the orange line), decreased by 0.4% compared to the estimated increase of 0.1%. The AtlantaFed revised its Q1 GDP forecast to 1.1%, down from 2.5% the previous week, just one day before the GDP release. Have they all gone vaca for the past 3 weeks? Tomorrow's GDP report is not going to look pretty. The Business TLDR, service sector is still strong, but goods are probably dead; while mega caps are beating estimations and about to make new highs (not quite yet), micro caps just made a new low. A song of ice and fire. Hilton beat both the top and bottom line and raised its full-year guidance, indicating strong consumer spending on travel services. Visa reported similar findings, noting that ticket sizes were declining as inflation moderates, but growth remains strong in services, travel, and entertainment. Outbound travel from the US to all geographies remained strong at around 150% of 2019 levels, indicating that the consumer is still in good shape. While the service sector seems to be still strong, transportation (indicator for goods orders) has been leading the decline. Dow Jones transportation index dropped 1000 points in 2 days. Who needs stuff when you can go places and snap some pics for the gram? Meta beat both top and bottom line and lifted guidance. My personal take on earnings is that growth is very limited down the road. MAU barely moved while ARPU declined, and more importantly, operating margins were down significantly (31% to 25%) yoy, highlighting challenges from both competition and economic uncertainty. Reality Lab should be shut down completely, as it’s still struggling for direction after years of exploration. Finding new revenue is a must for Meta; it might as well completely pivot to AI.
