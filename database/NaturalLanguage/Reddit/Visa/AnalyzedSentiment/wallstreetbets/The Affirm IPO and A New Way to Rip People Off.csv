,"So I was browsing LULU looking at new joggers (ok fine, I was checking out the guys/girls modeling their shit) and it says $128 OR 4 payments of $32 with Afterpay which made me realize I have seen a lot of ""offers"" like that and wanted to see if it is a money making opportunity. TL;DR: Buy Affirm when its IPO goes live. Former PayPal execs are starting microlending and ""buy now, pay later"" companies which could become the modern credit card. Affirm is a large one is going to IPO with a potential $100M offering. The Affirm/Shopify partnership could be like Ebay/Paypal back from the internet stone age EDIT 1: There's no IPO date schedule. Will probably be early next year For the purpose of this DD, we will be looking at Sezzle and Afterpay which are currently publicly traded and Affirm which has recently registered for an IPO (more on that later). All of these companies bill themselves as Fintech companies offering alternative payment platforms and a micro financial lender. Merchants have an incentive to sign up with one of these guys because the payment platform assumes the risk while the business gets advertised on their service. These companies make money by charging merchant fees and interest on missed payments. Starting with Sezzle cause that is the least interesting, its listed on the upside down market in Australia trading around $5 but is HQ'd in Minnesota and has estimated revenue of ~30M. Sezzle reported in February that they had achieved 1M users and now with the pandemic are estimated to be around 1.8M. 6 months ago they brought in former PayPal executive Veronica Katz as Chief Revenue Officer. Sezzle advertises its business product as ""Engaging the next generation"" and the ability to ""unlock millions of users and increase sales with zero risk"". Next is AfterPay, an actual Australia based company. They reported their year ending June 30 and revenue topped $11B with 10M Users and 55.4K merchants. There are tons of highlights in that report which are worth the scroll. Afterpay has a huge number of customers/products to choose from including the aforementioned LULU and other major retails stores youve heard of. They also have tons of Becky products on there including Shein, Ulta Beauty, Soma, and other places your girl shops at. This company, unsurprisingly, is teeming with former PayPal folks. VP Xin Ge 7 years at paypal, Dana Stalder VP back in 04-08 who is now a VC and on the Afterpay board, Amanda Pires 9 years at Paypal now a VP at afterpay. the company is also littered with former Visa and citigroup folks At this point for those still reading you understand what this game is all about, Affirm does the same thing as the other two. We're going to talk about Affirm and its upcoming IPO. Affirm's CEO/founder is Max Levchin who YOU GUESSED IT was an original cofounder of Paypal and was the CTO. Affirm shares unprofitable status like so many other silicon valley companies (PLTR, UBER, etc) but totaled 174M in Q1 2020 revenue. The biggest draw here for Affirm is it's partnership with Shopify to use its installment payment platform and gain access to shopify's >200M users. Affirm filed for an IPO to offer 100M in stock with an unannounced IPO date but will probably go in the next few months. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like there is a way to get exposure before IPO (unless you like Morgan Stanley) but the investors in this should tell you how big this company could be. That being said Affirm is seeking to be the credit card of the next generation who have no concept of money but will gladly take the pay for it later method. While they aren't yet profitable, this is a potential billion dollar company with potential buyouts from SQ, big banks, in the future. Conclusion: These companies are a hybrid of payment processors, micro lenders, and advertisers that support merchants of all sizes. With the continued explosion of online shopping and the natural human desire to worry about it later, investing in Affirm at IPO could be like getting in the ground floor of PayPal. We know about the PayPal mafia but even the lesser known execs are working on some very forward leaning companies that have huge potential. Affirm is going to IPO and its rocket both short term and long term","Affirm has Thiels name on it, so it's a clear buy.

During covid, one of our companies were able to take out a 100k loan from them that was extremely fast and easy (they already have a pattern of our sales data) and they took a 10-15% cut of every sale to go back to loan.

We were able to pay it off in less than 5 months because of this.There is also another fraud protection app called signify that we used.

Next is AfterPay, an actual Australia based company. They reported their year ending June 30 and revenue topped $11B with 10M Users and 55.4K merchants. There are tons of highlights in that report which are worth the scroll. Afterpay has a huge number of customers/products to choose from including the aforementioned LULU and other major retails stores youve heard of. They also have tons of Becky products on there including Shein, Ulta Beauty, Soma, and other places your girl shops at. This company, unsurprisingly, is teeming with former PayPal folks. VP Xin Ge 7 years at paypal, Dana Stalder VP back in 04-08 who is now a VC and on the Afterpay board, Amanda Pires 9 years at Paypal now a VP at afterpay. the company is also littered with former Visa and citigroup folks At this point for those still reading you understand what this game is all about, Affirm does the same thing as the other two. We're going to talk about Affirm and its upcoming IPO. Affirm's CEO/founder is Max Levchin who YOU GUESSED IT was an original cofounder of Paypal and was the CTO. Affirm shares unprofitable status like so many other silicon valley companies (PLTR, UBER, etc) but totaled 174M in Q1 2020 revenue. The biggest draw here for Affirm is it's partnership with Shopify to use its installment payment platform and gain access to shopify's >200M users. Affirm filed for an IPO to offer 100M in stock with an unannounced IPO date but will probably go in the next few months. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like there is a way to get exposure before IPO (unless you like Morgan Stanley) but the investors in this should tell you how big this company could be. That being said Affirm is seeking to be the credit card of the next generation who have no concept of money but will gladly take the pay for it later method. While they aren't yet profitable, this is a potential billion dollar company with potential buyouts from SQ, big banks, in the future. Conclusion: These companies are a hybrid of payment processors, micro lenders, and advertisers that support merchants of all sizes. With the continued explosion of online shopping and the natural human desire to worry about it later, investing in Affirm at IPO could be like getting in the ground floor of PayPal. We know about the PayPal mafia but even the lesser known execs are working on some very forward leaning companies that have huge potential. Affirm is going to IPO and its rocket both short term and long term",Afterpay is at 85 right now. I think it will pull back and might be a buy in the 70s. Long term I think it could have a similar size to Visa or Amex. I would say watch to see if/when Cathy adds it to ARKF,3,0.525,0.999,NEGATIVE
,"So I was browsing LULU looking at new joggers (ok fine, I was checking out the guys/girls modeling their shit) and it says $128 OR 4 payments of $32 with Afterpay which made me realize I have seen a lot of ""offers"" like that and wanted to see if it is a money making opportunity. TL;DR: Buy Affirm when its IPO goes live. Former PayPal execs are starting microlending and ""buy now, pay later"" companies which could become the modern credit card. Affirm is a large one is going to IPO with a potential $100M offering. The Affirm/Shopify partnership could be like Ebay/Paypal back from the internet stone age EDIT 1: There's no IPO date schedule. Will probably be early next year For the purpose of this DD, we will be looking at Sezzle and Afterpay which are currently publicly traded and Affirm which has recently registered for an IPO (more on that later). All of these companies bill themselves as Fintech companies offering alternative payment platforms and a micro financial lender. Merchants have an incentive to sign up with one of these guys because the payment platform assumes the risk while the business gets advertised on their service. These companies make money by charging merchant fees and interest on missed payments. Starting with Sezzle cause that is the least interesting, its listed on the upside down market in Australia trading around $5 but is HQ'd in Minnesota and has estimated revenue of ~30M.
