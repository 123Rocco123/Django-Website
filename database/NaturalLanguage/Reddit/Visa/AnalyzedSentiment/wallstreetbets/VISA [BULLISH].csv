And why now?Why not way for it to break out of this range and swing trade a weekly for a few days â€” you spend the least amount of money on time value and premium, and capture the profit on the move you are expecting.Edit: you are choosing a 6 delta for its relative cheapness, but thats because you have so much time value and higher delta would be expensive.
