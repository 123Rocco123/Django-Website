,,"OP, let me get this straight. Your plan is to take out ~$1,000 as a 0% loan with a 4% up front fee in order to buy a t bill that in theory matures before when that loan is due? Therefore granting you a difference in ~1% YTM?4% of 1,000 is $40. You now have $960 completely free of interest for 1 year. You buy a 1 year T bill, somehow finding one trading at a discount of 96.00 ($960) or lower. Assuming you find that without any sort of mark-up or commission fee for purchasing (treasury direct) you then hold that until it matures before October?You have now made $40-$50 in interest from holding to maturity - the $40 fee BofA charges you. Congratulations, in 1 year you got a 1% return.When you could just buy a fucking T Bill and get 5.5% return.Idk why Iâ€™m fucking subscribed to this sub anymore. Did I miss anything here?",0,0.541,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,Itâ€™s a cash advance. The point is you donâ€™t have the money to buy the bond. Itâ€™s a way to get money you donâ€™t have and make zero risk cash from it. Yes itâ€™s a tiny return and maybe more hassle than itâ€™s worth but his reasoning isnâ€™t wrong.,1,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.959
