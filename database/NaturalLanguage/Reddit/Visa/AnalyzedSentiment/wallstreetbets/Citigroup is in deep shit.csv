If their risk assessment programs and risk management were shitty, then they may have some assets that are grossly overvalued. Especially if they're holding a large derivative position.And then like in the movie Margin Call, somebody comes along and figures out what's really going on, what the correct risk assessment shows and the ""oh shit"" moment happens inside the company before the rest of the world knows.The clowns over on C's yahoo finance board kept saying yesterday C was an incredible buy because the stock was 30% under book value. If it's that far under BV, and still tanking, then there's a problem. Otherwise people would be buying it up left and right.Remember, C almost died back in 2008-09 and had to do a 10-1 reverse split just so the stock could still be traded by the big boys and have a two digit stock price.

A bank like Citi doesn't hold equity shares for liquidity, and the risk weighted capital treatment of ownership of common equity is onerous, so any holdings they have are likely hedged, or walled off in capital markets or funds business. So it is somewhat immaterial to the stock price of a bank, if its stock holdings trend down in price. Commercial banks are generally discouraged from holding equities in their investment portfolio because that is what drove, in part, the run on the banks that lead to the great depression - banks could buy equities for their own investment holdings, funded by customer deposits. Equity markets collapsed, banks lost customer deposits, run on banks ensued.What a bank would sell for liquidity, should they need it, would be treasuries or MBS, followed by loans on the asset side of it's balance sheet. Most likely though they would just repo those fixed income securities to generate liquidity, or borrow in the overnight Fed market.",0,0.537,0.898,NEGATIVE

Stop me if you have heard this one.Ok, so Citi is not a money manager, they are a commercial bank. The term AUM doesn’t apply to Citi. Citi has assets of almost 2 trillion, or what would be called a 2 trillion $ balance sheet.An example of a money manager, and appropriate use of AUM would be Blackrock. Blackrock has 7.4 trillion AUM. But their total asset size, their balance sheet, is only 168 billion. How is this possible?AUM refers to money divided up into different “funds”, which are typically isolated in a bankruptcy remote way. So for example, if blackrock’s “SuperDuperFund XYZ” has 2 billion in it, and it goes to zero, “average ok fund ABC” which has 10 billion in it, still exists in its entirety and is unaffected. Blackrock would, in a vacuum, not be affected, but in reality having a fund blow up typically drives investors to flee the other funds you manage, at least to some extent.Blackrock makes money managing its AUM. Citi makes money by earning the spread from borrowing money for the short term at low rates, lending long term at higher rates, something known as “maturity transformation”. They also make money trading the assets on their balance sheet, but these are almost entirely fixed income instruments, not stocks. They probably make money from “making markets” in stocks, which requires them to hold a certain amount of shares, but this isn’t appropriate for the term AUM. They earn fees from investment banking activities, and are in the business of creating complex investment products that companies like blackrock buy. The Volker rule pretty much prohibits banks like Citi from running a hedge fund or money manager anywhere near their balance sheet.",2,0.523,1.0,NEGATIVE
