,"I wrote this last Wednesday but forgot to share it here I guess. Most of this should still apply now, and as a disclaimer, I'm now hoping for a bloody Monday. First, I'll talk about a medium textile factory, then a little about an international pharma company, but it should apply to many similar factories in northern China/international businesses in China. I'm saying this because, unless the gov/outside force props up the market, I don't see how there won't be a big fall (either tomorrow or when ER come out saying “we have no supply/revenue”). The factory has just now begun working again, and the only reason they’re able to at all is because the entire city (10+ mil ppl) has effectively banned outsiders from coming in. The government has ASKED     certain sectors in certain areas to start working again. While everyone at this particular factory is working, some people (I’d guess between 10-30% in the city) are too scared to go out publicly, so aren’t working. The government is giving an allowance to workers supplementing their normal income if they go back to work now (200 RMB/day, about $14, though the $14 goes further than it would in Europe/NA). Orders for this factory have just now started coming back in (after about a 1 month break), though many smaller factories still aren’t up at all. The industry most affected there is food service (nobody is going out to eat), but many small businesses are under threat of bankruptcy because the gov didn’t step in in time. Many companies that previously ordered exclusively through China are now either switching to other countries in Asia (long-term) (something that was happening anyways) or having supply issues. For the pharma conglomerate, they (and most other large international businesses) have completely withdrawn all non-essential personnel from China (they did in mid January) and have shut down most/all production in the region (some other Asian countries aren’t as heavily affected right now, but there’s only so much you can do without a regional HQ to report to afaik). This includes sending locals home. This includes many global producers (Foxconn/Apple is the most prominent rn). I think one of the easiest ways to gauge global sentiment (I’m definitely biased here) is by looking at what international/domestic schools/universities are doing. NYU Shanghai/Duke Kunshan/etc. have all delayed opening and HEAVILY advised going to the primary campus (USA instead of China) for the semester. The Chinese students/anyone who couldn’t get a visa/anyone who didn’t want to go to the host school have been offered alternatives such as not taking the semester (getting all fees back), taking online courses by the China based profs, and waiting until the school opens back up (many people think NYUSH/DKU won’t open for the semester, though they're currently planning to open early march). *end of the original post* The only major change since I posted this is that Shanghai and Beijing (and several other cities) are now forcing people to work by cutting off the stipend non-workers were originally getting. Thoughts are welcome, my position is earning money as the American people lose it. tl;dr puts, I don't think SPY will be able to meet it's earnings expectations and that's going to start setting in for investors. I will probably pick up some more weekly puts at market open tomorrow.",After seeing the after market. Would you still buy the dips mr. bull?,0,0.566,0.983,NEGATIVE
