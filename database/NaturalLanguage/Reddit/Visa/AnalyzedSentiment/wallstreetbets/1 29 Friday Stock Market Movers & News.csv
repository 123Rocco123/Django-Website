,"Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Friday. Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM- 4 things to know before the stock market opens Friday 1. Dow futures extend losses as Wall Street’s volatile week continues The Dow Jones Industrial Average was set to drop 300 points at Friday’s open, extending losses with Dow stock Johnson & Johnson falling after the U.S. drug giant released data about its one-dose coronavirus vaccine. The shot was 72% effective in the U.S., but less so in other regions. Wall Street has seen a volatile week, also marked by the Reddit-fueled frenzy around GameStop and other highly shorted stocks. The Dow Thursday recovered nearly half of Wednesday’s 633-point decline, the worst one-session drop since late October. Ahead of Friday’s trading, the Dow was nearly 2% away from its closing record high earlier this month. Three Dow stocks — Caterpillar, Honeywell and Chevron — reported quarterly earnings before-the-bell, along with drugmaker Eli Lilly. 2. J&J says vaccine less effective against some Covid variants J&J’s highly anticipated vaccine results were based on 468 confirmed Covid-19 cases among the phase three trial’s more than 43,000 volunteers, including those infected with the new, highly contagious strain found in South Africa. J&J also said the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease four weeks after vaccination in all adults. If the J&J vaccine gets cleared by the FDA, it would be the third approved for emergency use in the U.S., behind the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and Moderna’s, both of which are two doses. U.S.-based biotech firm Novavax said late Thursday that its coronavirus vaccine was more than 89% effective in protecting against Covid-19. In its phase three clinical trial conducted in Britain, the two-shot vaccine appeared to be 85.6% effective against the new strain originally found in the U.K. However, a phase two study in South African, the Novavax was only 49.4% effective against the new variant found in that country. Shares of Novavax surged nearly 60% in Friday’s premarket. 3. Robinhood raises $1 billion, taps credit lines to facilitate GameStop trading Robinhood raised $1 billion overnight from investors to shore up its balance sheet as the brokerage app was set to ease restrictions in the trading of certain volatile stocks, according to CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. The money raised was on top of the $500 million the broker accessed through credit lines to ensure it had the capital required to keep allowing its clients to trade stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC tapping the credit lines was a proactive measure and denied it was because of a liquidity issue. After stumbling a day earlier, GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares surged 80% and 50% in Friday’s premarket, respectively. 4. Democrats reject GOP attempts to break up Biden relief measure Democrats on Capitol Hill and the White House rejected a Republican pitch to split President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan into smaller chunks. Democrats appeared ready to push the measure through without GOP help. Success would give Biden a signature accomplishment in his first 100 days in office, unleashing money to expand vaccinations and reopen schools, send $1,400 direct payments to households, and other priorities, including a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. Failure would be a high-profile setback early in his presidency. STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: (CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!) YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: (CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!)

The shot was 72% effective in the U.S., but less so in other regions. Wall Street has seen a volatile week, also marked by the Reddit-fueled frenzy around GameStop and other highly shorted stocks. The Dow Thursday recovered nearly half of Wednesday’s 633-point decline, the worst one-session drop since late October. Ahead of Friday’s trading, the Dow was nearly 2% away from its closing record high earlier this month. Three Dow stocks — Caterpillar, Honeywell and Chevron — reported quarterly earnings before-the-bell, along with drugmaker Eli Lilly. 2. J&J says vaccine less effective against some Covid variants J&J’s highly anticipated vaccine results were based on 468 confirmed Covid-19 cases among the phase three trial’s more than 43,000 volunteers, including those infected with the new, highly contagious strain found in South Africa. J&J also said the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease four weeks after vaccination in all adults. If the J&J vaccine gets cleared by the FDA, it would be the third approved for emergency use in the U.S., behind the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and Moderna’s, both of which are two doses. U.S.-based biotech firm Novavax said late Thursday that its coronavirus vaccine was more than 89% effective in protecting against Covid-19. In its phase three clinical trial conducted in Britain, the two-shot vaccine appeared to be 85.6% effective against the new strain originally found in the U.K. However, a phase two study in South African, the Novavax was only 49.4% effective against the new variant found in that country. Shares of Novavax surged nearly 60% in Friday’s premarket. 3. Robinhood raises $1 billion, taps credit lines to facilitate GameStop trading Robinhood raised $1 billion overnight from investors to shore up its balance sheet as the brokerage app was set to ease restrictions in the trading of certain volatile stocks, according to CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. The money raised was on top of the $500 million the broker accessed through credit lines to ensure it had the capital required to keep allowing its clients to trade stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC tapping the credit lines was a proactive measure and denied it was because of a liquidity issue. After stumbling a day earlier, GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares surged 80% and 50% in Friday’s premarket, respectively. 4. Democrats reject GOP attempts to break up Biden relief measure Democrats on Capitol Hill and the White House rejected a Republican pitch to split President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan into smaller chunks. Democrats appeared ready to push the measure through without GOP help. Success would give Biden a signature accomplishment in his first 100 days in office, unleashing money to expand vaccinations and reopen schools, send $1,400 direct payments to households, and other priorities, including a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. Failure would be a high-profile setback early in his presidency. STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: (CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!) YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: (CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!)

The shot was 72% effective in the U.S., but less so in other regions. Wall Street has seen a volatile week, also marked by the Reddit-fueled frenzy around GameStop and other highly shorted stocks. The Dow Thursday recovered nearly half of Wednesday’s 633-point decline, the worst one-session drop since late October. Ahead of Friday’s trading, the Dow was nearly 2% away from its closing record high earlier this month. Three Dow stocks — Caterpillar, Honeywell and Chevron — reported quarterly earnings before-the-bell, along with drugmaker Eli Lilly. 2. J&J says vaccine less effective against some Covid variants J&J’s highly anticipated vaccine results were based on 468 confirmed Covid-19 cases among the phase three trial’s more than 43,000 volunteers, including those infected with the new, highly contagious strain found in South Africa. J&J also said the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease four weeks after vaccination in all adults. If the J&J vaccine gets cleared by the FDA, it would be the third approved for emergency use in the U.S., behind the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and Moderna’s, both of which are two doses. U.S.-based biotech firm Novavax said late Thursday that its coronavirus vaccine was more than 89% effective in protecting against Covid-19. In its phase three clinical trial conducted in Britain, the two-shot vaccine appeared to be 85.6% effective against the new strain originally found in the U.K. However, a phase two study in South African, the Novavax was only 49.4% effective against the new variant found in that country. Shares of Novavax surged nearly 60% in Friday’s premarket. 3. Robinhood raises $1 billion, taps credit lines to facilitate GameStop trading Robinhood raised $1 billion overnight from investors to shore up its balance sheet as the brokerage app was set to ease restrictions in the trading of certain volatile stocks, according to CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. The money raised was on top of the $500 million the broker accessed through credit lines to ensure it had the capital required to keep allowing its clients to trade stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC tapping the credit lines was a proactive measure and denied it was because of a liquidity issue. After stumbling a day earlier, GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares surged 80% and 50% in Friday’s premarket, respectively. 4. Democrats reject GOP attempts to break up Biden relief measure Democrats on Capitol Hill and the White House rejected a Republican pitch to split President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan into smaller chunks. Democrats appeared ready to push the measure through without GOP help. Success would give Biden a signature accomplishment in his first 100 days in office, unleashing money to expand vaccinations and reopen schools, send $1,400 direct payments to households, and other priorities, including a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. Failure would be a high-profile setback early in his presidency. STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: (CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!) YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: (CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!)

The Dow Thursday recovered nearly half of Wednesday’s 633-point decline, the worst one-session drop since late October. Ahead of Friday’s trading, the Dow was nearly 2% away from its closing record high earlier this month. Three Dow stocks — Caterpillar, Honeywell and Chevron — reported quarterly earnings before-the-bell, along with drugmaker Eli Lilly. 2. J&J says vaccine less effective against some Covid variants J&J’s highly anticipated vaccine results were based on 468 confirmed Covid-19 cases among the phase three trial’s more than 43,000 volunteers, including those infected with the new, highly contagious strain found in South Africa. J&J also said the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease four weeks after vaccination in all adults. If the J&J vaccine gets cleared by the FDA, it would be the third approved for emergency use in the U.S., behind the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and Moderna’s, both of which are two doses. U.S.-based biotech firm Novavax said late Thursday that its coronavirus vaccine was more than 89% effective in protecting against Covid-19. In its phase three clinical trial conducted in Britain, the two-shot vaccine appeared to be 85.6% effective against the new strain originally found in the U.K. However, a phase two study in South African, the Novavax was only 49.4% effective against the new variant found in that country. Shares of Novavax surged nearly 60% in Friday’s premarket. 3. Robinhood raises $1 billion, taps credit lines to facilitate GameStop trading Robinhood raised $1 billion overnight from investors to shore up its balance sheet as the brokerage app was set to ease restrictions in the trading of certain volatile stocks, according to CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. The money raised was on top of the $500 million the broker accessed through credit lines to ensure it had the capital required to keep allowing its clients to trade stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC tapping the credit lines was a proactive measure and denied it was because of a liquidity issue. After stumbling a day earlier, GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares surged 80% and 50% in Friday’s premarket, respectively. 4. Democrats reject GOP attempts to break up Biden relief measure Democrats on Capitol Hill and the White House rejected a Republican pitch to split President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan into smaller chunks. Democrats appeared ready to push the measure through without GOP help. Success would give Biden a signature accomplishment in his first 100 days in office, unleashing money to expand vaccinations and reopen schools, send $1,400 direct payments to households, and other priorities, including a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. Failure would be a high-profile setback early in his presidency. STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: (CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!) YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: (CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!)

The shot was 72% effective in the U.S., but less so in other regions. Wall Street has seen a volatile week, also marked by the Reddit-fueled frenzy around GameStop and other highly shorted stocks. The Dow Thursday recovered nearly half of Wednesday’s 633-point decline, the worst one-session drop since late October. Ahead of Friday’s trading, the Dow was nearly 2% away from its closing record high earlier this month. Three Dow stocks — Caterpillar, Honeywell and Chevron — reported quarterly earnings before-the-bell, along with drugmaker Eli Lilly. 2. J&J says vaccine less effective against some Covid variants J&J’s highly anticipated vaccine results were based on 468 confirmed Covid-19 cases among the phase three trial’s more than 43,000 volunteers, including those infected with the new, highly contagious strain found in South Africa. J&J also said the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease four weeks after vaccination in all adults. If the J&J vaccine gets cleared by the FDA, it would be the third approved for emergency use in the U.S., behind the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and Moderna’s, both of which are two doses. U.S.-based biotech firm Novavax said late Thursday that its coronavirus vaccine was more than 89% effective in protecting against Covid-19. In its phase three clinical trial conducted in Britain, the two-shot vaccine appeared to be 85.6% effective against the new strain originally found in the U.K. However, a phase two study in South African, the Novavax was only 49.4% effective against the new variant found in that country. Shares of Novavax surged nearly 60% in Friday’s premarket. 3. Robinhood raises $1 billion, taps credit lines to facilitate GameStop trading Robinhood raised $1 billion overnight from investors to shore up its balance sheet as the brokerage app was set to ease restrictions in the trading of certain volatile stocks, according to CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. The money raised was on top of the $500 million the broker accessed through credit lines to ensure it had the capital required to keep allowing its clients to trade stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC tapping the credit lines was a proactive measure and denied it was because of a liquidity issue. After stumbling a day earlier, GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares surged 80% and 50% in Friday’s premarket, respectively. 4. Democrats reject GOP attempts to break up Biden relief measure Democrats on Capitol Hill and the White House rejected a Republican pitch to split President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan into smaller chunks. Democrats appeared ready to push the measure through without GOP help. Success would give Biden a signature accomplishment in his first 100 days in office, unleashing money to expand vaccinations and reopen schools, send $1,400 direct payments to households, and other priorities, including a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. Failure would be a high-profile setback early in his presidency. STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: (CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!) YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: (CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!)

The shot was 72% effective in the U.S., but less so in other regions. Wall Street has seen a volatile week, also marked by the Reddit-fueled frenzy around GameStop and other highly shorted stocks. The Dow Thursday recovered nearly half of Wednesday’s 633-point decline, the worst one-session drop since late October. Ahead of Friday’s trading, the Dow was nearly 2% away from its closing record high earlier this month. Three Dow stocks — Caterpillar, Honeywell and Chevron — reported quarterly earnings before-the-bell, along with drugmaker Eli Lilly. 2. J&J says vaccine less effective against some Covid variants J&J’s highly anticipated vaccine results were based on 468 confirmed Covid-19 cases among the phase three trial’s more than 43,000 volunteers, including those infected with the new, highly contagious strain found in South Africa. J&J also said the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease four weeks after vaccination in all adults. If the J&J vaccine gets cleared by the FDA, it would be the third approved for emergency use in the U.S., behind the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and Moderna’s, both of which are two doses. U.S.-based biotech firm Novavax said late Thursday that its coronavirus vaccine was more than 89% effective in protecting against Covid-19. In its phase three clinical trial conducted in Britain, the two-shot vaccine appeared to be 85.6% effective against the new strain originally found in the U.K. However, a phase two study in South African, the Novavax was only 49.4% effective against the new variant found in that country. Shares of Novavax surged nearly 60% in Friday’s premarket. 3. Robinhood raises $1 billion, taps credit lines to facilitate GameStop trading Robinhood raised $1 billion overnight from investors to shore up its balance sheet as the brokerage app was set to ease restrictions in the trading of certain volatile stocks, according to CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. The money raised was on top of the $500 million the broker accessed through credit lines to ensure it had the capital required to keep allowing its clients to trade stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC tapping the credit lines was a proactive measure and denied it was because of a liquidity issue. After stumbling a day earlier, GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares surged 80% and 50% in Friday’s premarket, respectively. 4. Democrats reject GOP attempts to break up Biden relief measure Democrats on Capitol Hill and the White House rejected a Republican pitch to split President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan into smaller chunks. Democrats appeared ready to push the measure through without GOP help. Success would give Biden a signature accomplishment in his first 100 days in office, unleashing money to expand vaccinations and reopen schools, send $1,400 direct payments to households, and other priorities, including a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. Failure would be a high-profile setback early in his presidency. STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: (CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!) YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: (CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!)

The Dow Thursday recovered nearly half of Wednesday’s 633-point decline, the worst one-session drop since late October. Ahead of Friday’s trading, the Dow was nearly 2% away from its closing record high earlier this month. Three Dow stocks — Caterpillar, Honeywell and Chevron — reported quarterly earnings before-the-bell, along with drugmaker Eli Lilly. 2. J&J says vaccine less effective against some Covid variants J&J’s highly anticipated vaccine results were based on 468 confirmed Covid-19 cases among the phase three trial’s more than 43,000 volunteers, including those infected with the new, highly contagious strain found in South Africa. J&J also said the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease four weeks after vaccination in all adults. If the J&J vaccine gets cleared by the FDA, it would be the third approved for emergency use in the U.S., behind the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and Moderna’s, both of which are two doses. U.S.-based biotech firm Novavax said late Thursday that its coronavirus vaccine was more than 89% effective in protecting against Covid-19. In its phase three clinical trial conducted in Britain, the two-shot vaccine appeared to be 85.6% effective against the new strain originally found in the U.K. However, a phase two study in South African, the Novavax was only 49.4% effective against the new variant found in that country. Shares of Novavax surged nearly 60% in Friday’s premarket. 3. Robinhood raises $1 billion, taps credit lines to facilitate GameStop trading Robinhood raised $1 billion overnight from investors to shore up its balance sheet as the brokerage app was set to ease restrictions in the trading of certain volatile stocks, according to CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. The money raised was on top of the $500 million the broker accessed through credit lines to ensure it had the capital required to keep allowing its clients to trade stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC tapping the credit lines was a proactive measure and denied it was because of a liquidity issue. After stumbling a day earlier, GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares surged 80% and 50% in Friday’s premarket, respectively. 4. Democrats reject GOP attempts to break up Biden relief measure Democrats on Capitol Hill and the White House rejected a Republican pitch to split President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan into smaller chunks. Democrats appeared ready to push the measure through without GOP help. Success would give Biden a signature accomplishment in his first 100 days in office, unleashing money to expand vaccinations and reopen schools, send $1,400 direct payments to households, and other priorities, including a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. Failure would be a high-profile setback early in his presidency. STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: (CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!) YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: (CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!)

Three Dow stocks — Caterpillar, Honeywell and Chevron — reported quarterly earnings before-the-bell, along with drugmaker Eli Lilly. 2. J&J says vaccine less effective against some Covid variants J&J’s highly anticipated vaccine results were based on 468 confirmed Covid-19 cases among the phase three trial’s more than 43,000 volunteers, including those infected with the new, highly contagious strain found in South Africa. J&J also said the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease four weeks after vaccination in all adults. If the J&J vaccine gets cleared by the FDA, it would be the third approved for emergency use in the U.S., behind the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and Moderna’s, both of which are two doses. U.S.-based biotech firm Novavax said late Thursday that its coronavirus vaccine was more than 89% effective in protecting against Covid-19. In its phase three clinical trial conducted in Britain, the two-shot vaccine appeared to be 85.6% effective against the new strain originally found in the U.K. However, a phase two study in South African, the Novavax was only 49.4% effective against the new variant found in that country. Shares of Novavax surged nearly 60% in Friday’s premarket. 3. Robinhood raises $1 billion, taps credit lines to facilitate GameStop trading Robinhood raised $1 billion overnight from investors to shore up its balance sheet as the brokerage app was set to ease restrictions in the trading of certain volatile stocks, according to CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. The money raised was on top of the $500 million the broker accessed through credit lines to ensure it had the capital required to keep allowing its clients to trade stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC tapping the credit lines was a proactive measure and denied it was because of a liquidity issue. After stumbling a day earlier, GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares surged 80% and 50% in Friday’s premarket, respectively. 4. Democrats reject GOP attempts to break up Biden relief measure Democrats on Capitol Hill and the White House rejected a Republican pitch to split President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan into smaller chunks. Democrats appeared ready to push the measure through without GOP help. Success would give Biden a signature accomplishment in his first 100 days in office, unleashing money to expand vaccinations and reopen schools, send $1,400 direct payments to households, and other priorities, including a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. Failure would be a high-profile setback early in his presidency. STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: (CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!) YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: (CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!)

J&J says vaccine less effective against some Covid variants J&J’s highly anticipated vaccine results were based on 468 confirmed Covid-19 cases among the phase three trial’s more than 43,000 volunteers, including those infected with the new, highly contagious strain found in South Africa. J&J also said the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease four weeks after vaccination in all adults. If the J&J vaccine gets cleared by the FDA, it would be the third approved for emergency use in the U.S., behind the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and Moderna’s, both of which are two doses. U.S.-based biotech firm Novavax said late Thursday that its coronavirus vaccine was more than 89% effective in protecting against Covid-19. In its phase three clinical trial conducted in Britain, the two-shot vaccine appeared to be 85.6% effective against the new strain originally found in the U.K. However, a phase two study in South African, the Novavax was only 49.4% effective against the new variant found in that country. Shares of Novavax surged nearly 60% in Friday’s premarket. 3. Robinhood raises $1 billion, taps credit lines to facilitate GameStop trading Robinhood raised $1 billion overnight from investors to shore up its balance sheet as the brokerage app was set to ease restrictions in the trading of certain volatile stocks, according to CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. The money raised was on top of the $500 million the broker accessed through credit lines to ensure it had the capital required to keep allowing its clients to trade stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC tapping the credit lines was a proactive measure and denied it was because of a liquidity issue. After stumbling a day earlier, GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares surged 80% and 50% in Friday’s premarket, respectively. 4.

How do they do that?They do that by sending your order out to be filled by a brokerage slash hedge fund like Melvin Capital or Citadel.

J&J also said the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease four weeks after vaccination in all adults.

,"Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Friday. Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM- 4 things to know before the stock market opens Friday 1. Dow futures extend losses as Wall Street’s volatile week continues The Dow Jones Industrial Average was set to drop 300 points at Friday’s open, extending losses with Dow stock Johnson & Johnson falling after the U.S. drug giant released data about its one-dose coronavirus vaccine. The shot was 72% effective in the U.S., but less so in other regions. Wall Street has seen a volatile week, also marked by the Reddit-fueled frenzy around GameStop and other highly shorted stocks. The Dow Thursday recovered nearly half of Wednesday’s 633-point decline, the worst one-session drop since late October. Ahead of Friday’s trading, the Dow was nearly 2% away from its closing record high earlier this month. Three Dow stocks — Caterpillar, Honeywell and Chevron — reported quarterly earnings before-the-bell, along with drugmaker Eli Lilly. 2. J&J says vaccine less effective against some Covid variants J&J’s highly anticipated vaccine results were based on 468 confirmed Covid-19 cases among the phase three trial’s more than 43,000 volunteers, including those infected with the new, highly contagious strain found in South Africa. J&J also said the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease four weeks after vaccination in all adults. If the J&J vaccine gets cleared by the FDA, it would be the third approved for emergency use in the U.S., behind the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and Moderna’s, both of which are two doses. U.S.-based biotech firm Novavax said late Thursday that its coronavirus vaccine was more than 89% effective in protecting against Covid-19. In its phase three clinical trial conducted in Britain, the two-shot vaccine appeared to be 85.6% effective against the new strain originally found in the U.K. However, a phase two study in South African, the Novavax was only 49.4% effective against the new variant found in that country. Shares of Novavax surged nearly 60% in Friday’s premarket. 3. Robinhood raises $1 billion, taps credit lines to facilitate GameStop trading Robinhood raised $1 billion overnight from investors to shore up its balance sheet as the brokerage app was set to ease restrictions in the trading of certain volatile stocks, according to CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. The money raised was on top of the $500 million the broker accessed through credit lines to ensure it had the capital required to keep allowing its clients to trade stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC tapping the credit lines was a proactive measure and denied it was because of a liquidity issue. After stumbling a day earlier, GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares surged 80% and 50% in Friday’s premarket, respectively. 4. Democrats reject GOP attempts to break up Biden relief measure Democrats on Capitol Hill and the White House rejected a Republican pitch to split President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan into smaller chunks. Democrats appeared ready to push the measure through without GOP help. Success would give Biden a signature accomplishment in his first 100 days in office, unleashing money to expand vaccinations and reopen schools, send $1,400 direct payments to households, and other priorities, including a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. Failure would be a high-profile setback early in his presidency. STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: (CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!) YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: (CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!)

,"Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Friday. Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM- 4 things to know before the stock market opens Friday 1. Dow futures extend losses as Wall Street’s volatile week continues The Dow Jones Industrial Average was set to drop 300 points at Friday’s open, extending losses with Dow stock Johnson & Johnson falling after the U.S. drug giant released data about its one-dose coronavirus vaccine. The shot was 72% effective in the U.S., but less so in other regions. Wall Street has seen a volatile week, also marked by the Reddit-fueled frenzy around GameStop and other highly shorted stocks. The Dow Thursday recovered nearly half of Wednesday’s 633-point decline, the worst one-session drop since late October. Ahead of Friday’s trading, the Dow was nearly 2% away from its closing record high earlier this month. Three Dow stocks — Caterpillar, Honeywell and Chevron — reported quarterly earnings before-the-bell, along with drugmaker Eli Lilly. 2. J&J says vaccine less effective against some Covid variants J&J’s highly anticipated vaccine results were based on 468 confirmed Covid-19 cases among the phase three trial’s more than 43,000 volunteers, including those infected with the new, highly contagious strain found in South Africa. J&J also said the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease four weeks after vaccination in all adults. If the J&J vaccine gets cleared by the FDA, it would be the third approved for emergency use in the U.S., behind the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and Moderna’s, both of which are two doses. U.S.-based biotech firm Novavax said late Thursday that its coronavirus vaccine was more than 89% effective in protecting against Covid-19. In its phase three clinical trial conducted in Britain, the two-shot vaccine appeared to be 85.6% effective against the new strain originally found in the U.K. However, a phase two study in South African, the Novavax was only 49.4% effective against the new variant found in that country. Shares of Novavax surged nearly 60% in Friday’s premarket. 3. Robinhood raises $1 billion, taps credit lines to facilitate GameStop trading Robinhood raised $1 billion overnight from investors to shore up its balance sheet as the brokerage app was set to ease restrictions in the trading of certain volatile stocks, according to CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. The money raised was on top of the $500 million the broker accessed through credit lines to ensure it had the capital required to keep allowing its clients to trade stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC tapping the credit lines was a proactive measure and denied it was because of a liquidity issue. After stumbling a day earlier, GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares surged 80% and 50% in Friday’s premarket, respectively. 4. Democrats reject GOP attempts to break up Biden relief measure Democrats on Capitol Hill and the White House rejected a Republican pitch to split President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan into smaller chunks. Democrats appeared ready to push the measure through without GOP help. Success would give Biden a signature accomplishment in his first 100 days in office, unleashing money to expand vaccinations and reopen schools, send $1,400 direct payments to households, and other priorities, including a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. Failure would be a high-profile setback early in his presidency. STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: (CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!) YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: (CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!)
