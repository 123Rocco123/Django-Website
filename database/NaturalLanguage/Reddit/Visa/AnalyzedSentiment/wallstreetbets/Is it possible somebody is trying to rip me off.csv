,"About 6 weeks ago I got a text from a girl who had dialed the wrong number. For whatever reason I decided to keep talking to this girl, she was cool, just happens to be cute as well. She is from China, here on a worker's visa, but lives in New York City. I'm in Utah. We've talked about all sorts of things, and we send each other pictures and selfies almost every day. When we started talking to each other about what we do for a living, she had told me she is in to finance, and she uses MetaTrader5. Specifically XAUUD. She almost trades exclusively with gold. She's tried to help me use it, and set me up with a demo account and everything. She wants me to screenshot her everything then she tells me what to do (I didn't screenshot my password or anything). I've decided to just watch some YouTube videos on how to use MetaTrader. She says that her Uncle, who has lived in San Francisco for about 10 years helps her on MetaTrader. Like she'll tell me how she gets on the market and her Uncle tells her when to trade and stuff like that. She seems VERY willing to teach me how to use MetaTrader. I've thought of saving up $1000 dollars and seeing what I can do with it. She set me up a demo account for 100,000 dollars. Here's the rub: The other night she was talking how she had a bad night, she ONLY made 39k in one night. So then I'm like... ""Wait, so you're saying whenever you and your uncle get on the market you guys are making 5 figures?"" She tells me how she has made 130k in one night. Now I'm starting to wonder if this girl is trying to scam me somehow. I mean it can't be THAT easy to make that amount of money like that... I mean is she involved with insider trading? IDK, I obviously don't know anything about the market, and that's why I've come here to ask you guys cause you'll give it to me straight. The reason I came to this sub is because I was interested in the Gamestop/AMC stock that was artificially inflated for a short time. I mean I met this girl PURELY by chance, and she didn't getting ""very willing to help"" me with trading until we had been talking for a few weeks any way. She hasn't asked me to send her money or anything, and I know that she isn't sending me pics of someone else because of the nature of the pictures we send each other, but I COULD be wrong on that. I'm not simping for this girl or anything, the reason I found her so fascinating in the first place is because I like learning about other cultures, and I just had questions about how it was like growing up in Hong Kong. She is 36, I'm 32. But it makes me wonder... this has got to be too good to be true right? There's no way I stumbled on to someone that can help me build up money like this right? If you guys have any other questions don't hesitate to ask. I'm ignorant on trading and I knew I'd get some good answers here. I'd like to think she genuinely wants to help me make more money... but you never know.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

,"About 6 weeks ago I got a text from a girl who had dialed the wrong number. For whatever reason I decided to keep talking to this girl, she was cool, just happens to be cute as well. She is from China, here on a worker's visa, but lives in New York City. I'm in Utah. We've talked about all sorts of things, and we send each other pictures and selfies almost every day. When we started talking to each other about what we do for a living, she had told me she is in to finance, and she uses MetaTrader5. Specifically XAUUD. She almost trades exclusively with gold. She's tried to help me use it, and set me up with a demo account and everything. She wants me to screenshot her everything then she tells me what to do (I didn't screenshot my password or anything). I've decided to just watch some YouTube videos on how to use MetaTrader. She says that her Uncle, who has lived in San Francisco for about 10 years helps her on MetaTrader. Like she'll tell me how she gets on the market and her Uncle tells her when to trade and stuff like that. She seems VERY willing to teach me how to use MetaTrader. I've thought of saving up $1000 dollars and seeing what I can do with it. She set me up a demo account for 100,000 dollars. Here's the rub: The other night she was talking how she had a bad night, she ONLY made 39k in one night. So then I'm like... ""Wait, so you're saying whenever you and your uncle get on the market you guys are making 5 figures?"" She tells me how she has made 130k in one night. Now I'm starting to wonder if this girl is trying to scam me somehow. I mean it can't be THAT easy to make that amount of money like that... I mean is she involved with insider trading? IDK, I obviously don't know anything about the market, and that's why I've come here to ask you guys cause you'll give it to me straight. The reason I came to this sub is because I was interested in the Gamestop/AMC stock that was artificially inflated for a short time. I mean I met this girl PURELY by chance, and she didn't getting ""very willing to help"" me with trading until we had been talking for a few weeks any way. She hasn't asked me to send her money or anything, and I know that she isn't sending me pics of someone else because of the nature of the pictures we send each other, but I COULD be wrong on that. I'm not simping for this girl or anything, the reason I found her so fascinating in the first place is because I like learning about other cultures, and I just had questions about how it was like growing up in Hong Kong. She is 36, I'm 32. But it makes me wonder... this has got to be too good to be true right? There's no way I stumbled on to someone that can help me build up money like this right? If you guys have any other questions don't hesitate to ask. I'm ignorant on trading and I knew I'd get some good answers here.

,"About 6 weeks ago I got a text from a girl who had dialed the wrong number. For whatever reason I decided to keep talking to this girl, she was cool, just happens to be cute as well.

Like she'll tell me how she gets on the market and her Uncle tells her when to trade and stuff like that. She seems VERY willing to teach me how to use MetaTrader. I've thought of saving up $1000 dollars and seeing what I can do with it. She set me up a demo account for 100,000 dollars.

,"About 6 weeks ago I got a text from a girl who had dialed the wrong number. For whatever reason I decided to keep talking to this girl, she was cool, just happens to be cute as well.

She's tried to help me use it, and set me up with a demo account and everything. She wants me to screenshot her everything then she tells me what to do (I didn't screenshot my password or anything). I've decided to just watch some YouTube videos on how to use MetaTrader. She says that her Uncle, who has lived in San Francisco for about 10 years helps her on MetaTrader. Like she'll tell me how she gets on the market and her Uncle tells her when to trade and stuff like that. She seems VERY willing to teach me how to use MetaTrader.

I'm not simping for this girl or anything, the reason I found her so fascinating in the first place is because I like learning about other cultures, and I just had questions about how it was like growing up in Hong Kong. She is 36, I'm 32. But it makes me wonder... this has got to be too good to be true right? There's no way I stumbled on to someone that can help me build up money like this right? If you guys have any other questions don't hesitate to ask. I'm ignorant on trading and I knew I'd get some good answers here. I'd like to think she genuinely wants to help me make more money... but you never know.",When I knew the jig was up I did ask for nudes hahaha,1,0.501,POSITIVE,0.569
