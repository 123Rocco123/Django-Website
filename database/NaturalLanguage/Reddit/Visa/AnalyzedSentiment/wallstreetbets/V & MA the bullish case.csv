,"So you might have heard of these 2 like really big boomer companies: Visa and Mastercard. They both had great earnings but since the end of July V is down around 10% and MA around 15%. Red week after red week. You might wonder why. The thing is that no one really knows, as no really strong fundamental bearish argument can be dug up. Some people are saying that the recent drop is due to the BNPL companies pick up some steam. While that might me the case, I don't really see them taking the place of V and MA in the next few years. Firstly, they currently obey little to no regulation. We all know where that leads. The central banks around the world won't allow for much longer for """"fintechs"""" to go around lending money with very little to no credit check. Debt is already starting to form bubbles in different sectors of the market (look at govies, fucking Greece borrowing at negative interest rates lol, but more importantly the junk bonds are quite on fire with everyone trying to get some decent returns but that makes the yields drop even more). What nobody wants is a fucking retail debt bubble. So IF BNPL continues to get more market share, regulators will surely step in rather sooner than later. A second point is the demographics of the BNPL. Everyone has a credit/debit card, but not everyone is going to open accounts with fintechs to buy shit. Why would they do it when they already have that since forever from a bank that they more or less trust? BNPL is more appealing to the Z crowd, while the millenials and boomers (the segments having the highest wealth and spending) go with the credit cards. Not to mention the high and ultra high income people. Lastly (I have a few more points really but I'm bored talking about fucking BNPL), take a look at their valuations. Some BNPLs are worth like 15-20% of V. Companies that are losing (a lot of) money year after year. So, BNPL aside, why do I think V and MA will go up? Well, multiple reasons: the market will realize sooner or later that they are trading bellow fair price and as such the market will level this out. You can make money by getting ahead of the market or by riding the wave up; travel picking up again, Delta is just noise for the countries with high vaccination rates; this increases spending and even better spending in foreign currency; the FX revenues of these companies has understandably fallen since the pandemic; more and more payments are going cashless. While this has been true for a few years all around the world, the trend has picked up some pace especially in the emerging and developing countries where the entire market share goes to V and MA. spending season is set to start. You can figure out yourself what this means earnings are also approaching. By this fact alone the companies will get more attention from the smart money. If you decide to play this via options, you will get a nice vega bump price action: after dropping like 2 rocks, they actually had a decent week until they were taken down with the market last Friday Positions? I have V and MA shares in my boring investment account. I added more on the drop. I also have 225 and 227.5 calls on V expiring next Friday (the retard in me) and Oct 15 230, 235 and 240 calls. I exited my MA position because I was getting way overleveraged on this play, but I still hold my thesis. How you can play this? Well, the safest way is through shares. It might not be this week or this month, but this companies WILL go up. Other than that... calls ofc. I would advise at least 2 weeks out, but try to go for a month or more. I would go for the 230 and 235 on V, similar OTM strikes for MA. Or you could also play it wsb style with 227.5 for next Friday.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

Firstly, they currently obey little to no regulation. We all know where that leads. The central banks around the world won't allow for much longer for """"fintechs"""" to go around lending money with very little to no credit check.

A second point is the demographics of the BNPL. Everyone has a credit/debit card, but not everyone is going to open accounts with fintechs to buy shit. Why would they do it when they already have that since forever from a bank that they more or less trust?

Some BNPLs are worth like 15-20% of V. Companies that are losing (a lot of) money year after year. So, BNPL aside, why do I think V and MA will go up?

You can make money by getting ahead of the market or by riding the wave up; travel picking up again, Delta is just noise for the countries with high vaccination rates; this increases spending and even better spending in foreign currency; the FX revenues of these companies has understandably fallen since the pandemic; more and more payments are going cashless.

I don't really see a strong competition for cards issuers like V and MA. Besides, V and MA have so much cash that they can basically buy anything that they deem to be threating. Just like FB bought Instagram.",1,0.538,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"So you might have heard of these 2 like really big boomer companies: Visa and Mastercard. They both had great earnings but since the end of July V is down around 10% and MA around 15%. Red week after red week. You might wonder why. The thing is that no one really knows, as no really strong fundamental bearish argument can be dug up. Some people are saying that the recent drop is due to the BNPL companies pick up some steam. While that might me the case, I don't really see them taking the place of V and MA in the next few years. Firstly, they currently obey little to no regulation. We all know where that leads. The central banks around the world won't allow for much longer for """"fintechs"""" to go around lending money with very little to no credit check. Debt is already starting to form bubbles in different sectors of the market (look at govies, fucking Greece borrowing at negative interest rates lol, but more importantly the junk bonds are quite on fire with everyone trying to get some decent returns but that makes the yields drop even more). What nobody wants is a fucking retail debt bubble. So IF BNPL continues to get more market share, regulators will surely step in rather sooner than later. A second point is the demographics of the BNPL. Everyone has a credit/debit card, but not everyone is going to open accounts with fintechs to buy shit. Why would they do it when they already have that since forever from a bank that they more or less trust? BNPL is more appealing to the Z crowd, while the millenials and boomers (the segments having the highest wealth and spending) go with the credit cards. Not to mention the high and ultra high income people. Lastly (I have a few more points really but I'm bored talking about fucking BNPL), take a look at their valuations. Some BNPLs are worth like 15-20% of V. Companies that are losing (a lot of) money year after year. So, BNPL aside, why do I think V and MA will go up? Well, multiple reasons: the market will realize sooner or later that they are trading bellow fair price and as such the market will level this out. You can make money by getting ahead of the market or by riding the wave up; travel picking up again, Delta is just noise for the countries with high vaccination rates; this increases spending and even better spending in foreign currency; the FX revenues of these companies has understandably fallen since the pandemic; more and more payments are going cashless. While this has been true for a few years all around the world, the trend has picked up some pace especially in the emerging and developing countries where the entire market share goes to V and MA. spending season is set to start. You can figure out yourself what this means earnings are also approaching. By this fact alone the companies will get more attention from the smart money. If you decide to play this via options, you will get a nice vega bump price action: after dropping like 2 rocks, they actually had a decent week until they were taken down with the market last Friday Positions? I have V and MA shares in my boring investment account. I added more on the drop. I also have 225 and 227.5 calls on V expiring next Friday (the retard in me) and Oct 15 230, 235 and 240 calls. I exited my MA position because I was getting way overleveraged on this play, but I still hold my thesis. How you can play this? Well, the safest way is through shares. It might not be this week or this month, but this companies WILL go up. Other than that... calls ofc. I would advise at least 2 weeks out, but try to go for a month or more. I would go for the 230 and 235 on V, similar OTM strikes for MA. Or you could also play it wsb style with 227.5 for next Friday.",My credit card lets me do bnpl installments on some large purchases.
