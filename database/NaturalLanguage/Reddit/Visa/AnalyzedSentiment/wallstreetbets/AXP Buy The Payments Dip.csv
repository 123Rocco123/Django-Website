,This great company is selling off due to fears about over valuation of Visa and other high flying payments stocks. American Express is a much cheaper business at just 14 Forward PE and has a diversified business. The firm being a financial will also reap major rewards from yield curve steepening as China trade talks pump the markets and recession risk fades. A rate cut by the Fed will also boost consumer spending/optimism. The company is guiding for around 8% revenue growth and large stock buybacks. The options I purchased today are the September 20th $116 Calls for $2.23. These options will take you through next weeks Fed meeting where they are expected to cut rates by .25-50 bp. A more high risk play I'm looking at buying are the September 27th $119 strikes trading around $1.22.,"Visa and MasterCard are just the processors, so when users default, they don't care. Amex is the lender for a lot of cards as well as a processor. If there is a recession Amex will get hit hard with default write-offs. It should be lower than the others right now.",0,0.501,0.994,POSITIVE

The lending business is also a cash machine when consumer spending is strong like it is now. AMEX also has had low write offs due to targeting upper class consumers. In the crisis their charge offs were only about 10%. Which is bad but I don’t expect a 2008 style crisis anytime soon.,1,0.526,0.995,NEGATIVE
