,"Warren Buffett's company has now hit $1 trillion, becoming the first non-tech company in the U.S. to enter this exclusive club, which currently includes just six other companies, all from the tech world. To understand how significant this is, let’s see what you could buy with that astronomical amount: Netflix ($295B), McDonald's ($206B), Starbucks ($108B) — and you’d still have nearly $400 billion left! You could buy Tesla ($800B) and still have enough left to pick up Nike ($150B) for all your needs, from cars to sneakers. With $1 trillion, you could acquire Visa ($436B) and Mastercard ($436B), becoming the king of all payment systems, and still have money left for other investments. Finally, for $1 trillion, you could buy Disney ($162B), Boeing ($162B), Spotify ($69B), and Zoom ($20B) — and still have $587 billion left for other entertainment and technology ventures! Berkshire Hathaway is now worth as much as a whole lineup of the world’s biggest brands, and that’s without being in tech. This achievement underscores the power of long-term investing and Warren Buffett’s expertise in building an empire that can compete with the tech giants.
