In this report, KPMG complained about the lack of will of Wirecard to give informations, KPMG was unable to obtain standard information that it requested from Wirecard such as bank statements, customer names and contracts as well as transaction data. This document was the main reason of the Chris Hohn’s open letter. The famous hedge fund manager published an open letter on April 28 to Thomas Eichelmann, the chairman of Wirecard (https://www.tcifund.com/files/corporateengageement/wirecard/TCI%20-%20Letter%20to%20Wirecard%2028%20April%202020.pdf). In his letter, he states the audit made by KPMG was inconclusive, « KPMG explains that it has encountered an “Untersuchungshemmnis” (in English: obstacles to the investigation) », basically, 1 billion $ was missing between 2016 and 2018. So it raises questions to how investors, lenders and regulators can be confident that Wirecard’s current and historic accounting is accurate, so they wanted for Wirecard to show some trust by firing Markus the CEO, but today he is still here. He concluded by announcing that he was short selling 1.04% of shares outstanding of Wirecard. Since then : TILP filed an investor lawsuit. The lawsuit claims that the KPMG report showed that the group for years had experienced a massive shortfall in compliance that it had been obliged to disclose to shareholders early on.

The management didn't care about compliance at all. Where are those $1.9 billion? Have they ever learned how to make corect balance sheets? No. I think the money is not gone but they simply couldn't provide correct documentation. Imagine you create a startup in a booming market. You hire more and more employees but don't train them and don't question their work. I am sure some people who worked there left the company because they realized people are producing pseudo-compliant shit because they are clueless or reckless or simply don't care. Once person A left the company, person B had to take over persons A work and didn't question/care about it. This is how you fuck up documentation from time to time. This is why KPMG had its concerns. It's the responsibility of the management to assure compliance. They don't care. Basically a bunch of kids leading a company, ridiculous. They will most likely be acquired by another company (or go bankrupt - but I don't believe that).I would say skip wirecard, it can go either way...

In this report, KPMG complained about the lack of will of Wirecard to give informations, KPMG was unable to obtain standard information that it requested from Wirecard such as bank statements, customer names and contracts as well as transaction data. This document was the main reason of the Chris Hohn’s open letter. The famous hedge fund manager published an open letter on April 28 to Thomas Eichelmann, the chairman of Wirecard (https://www.tcifund.com/files/corporateengageement/wirecard/TCI%20-%20Letter%20to%20Wirecard%2028%20April%202020.pdf). In his letter, he states the audit made by KPMG was inconclusive, « KPMG explains that it has encountered an “Untersuchungshemmnis” (in English: obstacles to the investigation) », basically, 1 billion $ was missing between 2016 and 2018. So it raises questions to how investors, lenders and regulators can be confident that Wirecard’s current and historic accounting is accurate, so they wanted for Wirecard to show some trust by firing Markus the CEO, but today he is still here. He concluded by announcing that he was short selling 1.04% of shares outstanding of Wirecard. Since then : TILP filed an investor lawsuit. The lawsuit claims that the KPMG report showed that the group for years had experienced a massive shortfall in compliance that it had been obliged to disclose to shareholders early on. Why is it important ? Because this law firm has already won cases against Porsche and Volkswagen during the diesel gate. Al Alam a Dubai business payment processor their most significant business partner entered liquidation on May 2 Today the stock dropped 61% and their bonds by more than 40% because EY which was conducting an annual audit said that they were unable to confirm the existence of 2.1b $, and that « spurious cash balance » have been provided to auditor by 3rd party. This missing fund represents 25% of the company. They have to come clean by tomorrow (June 18). Conclusion : Considering the online payment business as fast very forward industry, Wirecard is facing two challenges : First, they will need to find a managerial equilibrium in a short time Second, they will need earn back trust from current clients and future ones. They may loose more clients in the short term. Those challenges are actually very hard to tackle in an healthy market but in this one it seems nearly impossible, furthermore, big investors will be selling massively those next few days so we might see more loses. I am not a financial advisor but I would say that in the long and short term the stock is going down as well as the company.
