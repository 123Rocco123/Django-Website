,"As far as my DCF valuation goes the price of American Express is about 20%-25% below intrinsic value, (although one can argue that my calculations are not accurate, therefore I urge you to calculate it yourself). Considering this discount and the fact that American Expressâ€™s competitive market share sits around 25% (up there with Bank of America at~25% as well) while visa and master card at ~7% each. I am considering buying it. One more upside is their closed system which eliminates any unnecessary costs to third parties and banks, the risk in here is the evolution of payment processing (if new technology presents itself to the market, more payment processors could replicate AXPâ€™s closed system) Client base- while visa and Mastercard focus on the volume of transactions and pays little attention to the customers interests, AXP focuses on customer preservation and aims at the interest of the individual card user,(with deals and free subscriptions just for choosing AXP). Providing these benefits AXP charges little higher fees that seem reasonable for each card and the plan the client chooses. AMX hasnâ€™t reached its full potential globally, there are some untapped market that American Express can start operating in globally. Some more risks - AMX finished 2023 beating visa master card and Bank of America in revenue, with return on invested capital of 10%. This is not a guarantee for the future, Bank of America and the new technology developed in the sector could potentially harm AMXâ€™s market share, but in the short term I donâ€™t see happening so quickly (to overthrow a king with a lot of steady free cash flow growth takes a long of effort and time). One more risk is that I can be biased because I own some shares already, to avoid having a biased view I tend to rethink my approach invert and attack it. so I would gladly appreciate your opinion and read through it thoroughly. I already own 6 shares just bc I own little bit of every potential purchase,(helps me track the asset). And I have a couple of limits down, each order is 100 shares, and so far I have on 220$, 210,200.
