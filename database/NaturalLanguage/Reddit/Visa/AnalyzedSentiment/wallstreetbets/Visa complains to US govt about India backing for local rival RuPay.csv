In public Visa has downplayed concerns about the rise of RuPay, which has been supported by public lobbying from Prime Minister Narendra Modi that has included likening the use of local cards to national service.

,"Summary India's RuPay dominates number of issued cards Prime Minister Modi, other officials promote use of RuPay Visa told U.S. govt Modi's linked RuPay use to national service Visa Inc (V.N) has complained to the U.S. government that India's ""informal and formal"" promotion of domestic payments rival RuPay hurts the U.S. giant in a key market, memos seen by Reuters show. In public Visa has downplayed concerns about the rise of RuPay, which has been supported by public lobbying from Prime Minister Narendra Modi that has included likening the use of local cards to national service. But U.S. government memos show Visa raised concerns about a ""level playing field"" in India during an Aug. 9 meeting between U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai and company executives, including CEO Alfred Kelly. Mastercard Inc (MA.N) has raised similar concerns privately with the USTR. Reuters reported in 2018 that the company had lodged a protest with the USTR that Modi was using nationalism to promote the local network. ""Visa remains concerned about India's informal and formal policies that appear to favour the business of National Payments Corporation of India"" (NPCI), the non-profit that runs RuPay, ""over other domestic and foreign electronic payments companies,"" said a USTR memo prepared for Tai ahead of the meeting. Visa told the U.S. government it was concerned India's ""push to use transit cards linked to RuPay"" and ""the not so subtle pressure on banks to issue"" RuPay cards, the USTR email showed. Mastercard and Visa count India as a key growth market, but have been jolted by a 2018 central bank directive for them to store payments data ""only in India"" for ""unfettered supervisory access"". Mastercard faces an indefinite ban on issuing new cards in India after the central bank said it was not complying with the 2018 rules.
