Once consent has been manufactured, they'll send in peace keepers to protect their economic interests and secure the border. It'll still be Russian territory on paper but be occupied and governed by the Chinese.If Russia pulls together quickly, the Chinese will negotiate a 1 sided deal that keeps them in total control but doesn't change any borders.
