,"Hi all, last week zip signed a deal with VISA, apple and google to make their service usable in stores, this will probably double the transaction volume they do and further fight credit cards. And yet since then their stocks have only gone down. It makes no sense and when earnings release stocks will fly. The only reason they are down is because Westpac had to sell their share in the company as they made a deal with afterpay. There is literally no reason for zip to be losing, this is potentially the best news the company has ever released. This isn't financial advice, just pointing out that there's no reason, in my opinion, for it to be down and it should go up as soon as people realise that. Cheers, See you at the moon.",r/asx_bets is leaking,0,0.505,1.0,NEGATIVE
