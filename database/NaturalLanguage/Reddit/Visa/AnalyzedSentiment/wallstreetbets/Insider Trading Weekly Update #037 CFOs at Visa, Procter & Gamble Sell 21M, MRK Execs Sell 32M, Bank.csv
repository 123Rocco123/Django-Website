,"GM, TL;DR - Purchases are up nearly 350% from the prior week and were primarily driven by buys within the Financial Services sector by insiders at regional banks. Sales rose to $1.2B (+146%) largely due to a $624M sale by Hotlink Investment Ltd of Playtika Holding Corp ($PLTK / Electronic Gaming). Of the 287 insiders who submitted Form 4 filings, 70 bought shares (+59%). Take a close look at the second chart, Insider Buying/Selling by Sector. For the second week in a row, the Financial Services sector is driving the majority of purchases. It is a stark contrast to the Healthcare sector where all of the 64 insiders sold shares. Things are certainly getting interesting with the sale of FCB. I’m inclined to think that these are bets on a backstop/bailout, but there’s always more to the story. Would love to get the opinions of some folks who work at banks to get a sense of how things seem at the ground level.
