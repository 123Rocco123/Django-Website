,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Best poster on WSB atm.,0,0.527,POSITIVE,1.0
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Thanks a lot man.🥺,1,0.507,POSITIVE,0.989
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",So for dummies:Buy puts on SPY when it is over 391 ish or higher. Buy puts that expire on 9/30 or 10/3.Buy calls after 10/3 for around early November.I’m also a dummy so I could of misunderstood this graduate level thesis post but godspeed you retards.,0,0.546,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",You my friend are a genius being able to dissect the info from that thesis post. God speed to you too sir. 😂👍,1,0.509,POSITIVE,1.0
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

Stock picks for tough month (dividend stock ) : CVX (Kevin Simpson) , ABBV (Andrew Graham) Investors should expect a rainbow after the September storm. ~ Jessica Inskip Options play director of product and education ( ofc jessica Bear market rally rainbow ) Inflation hits back to school shopping as parents look to second hand clothes :_( Spaceports pop up around the country and not all communities are happy about it. ( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Why buy calls after 9/30 if October will be a red month?,2,0.559,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",From what I understand he’s predicting the bottom around the first week of October. Then a bounce into the first week of November. Historically this man is a beast at bear market rallies so take this for what it’s worth but the thesis is solid,3,0.538,NEGATIVE,0.645
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",These SPY puts at $397 look so juicy,2,0.507,POSITIVE,0.984
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",apple rejecting finally...spx $4k is a big resistance,3,0.514,NEGATIVE,0.998
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you.

,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere.

I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone.

Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Haha keep holding them.🤣Yah the teacher doesnt hold leverage over Ayanakonji but he wont get loose. And then we we have ryuen blackmailing so maybe ryuen outwits him now coz he is bored. But man Kei likes Konji so much maybe they come in relationship in this season. Lets see...,5,0.504,POSITIVE,0.99

Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",I never knew the teacher tried blackmailing him ngl lol. He may be bored but I think he’s gonna start biting back more aggressively. Who knows but we’ll see.,6,0.505,NEGATIVE,0.995
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",I deposited my last 1k and shorted. Down a lot…. So I hope the market can drop sometime soon. Diamond handling these puts,4,0.53,POSITIVE,0.985
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(","I’m seeing the same thing. My entry wasn’t great, I forgot all about the apple event. But can average down pretty nicely.",4,0.506,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you.

,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Oh really thank you for your warm words.🥺👍,1,0.5,POSITIVE,0.972
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Upvoted just bc you wrote out a dissertation amount of info.,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.961
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Thanks man and i apologize for making it a university essay thesis.,1,0.512,NEGATIVE,0.846
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",nah man keep doing you. this is whole lot better than shit memes,2,0.507,POSITIVE,0.998
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Ran out of battery by scrolling to the comment section.,0,0.504,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down.

I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Dude that's apple cook fault. All the phone have slowed down or died becoz of battery drainage today. Bloomberg 1/3 polls from today suggest that.,1,0.526,NEGATIVE,1.0

But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on...

Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Awesome as always friend. But in all seriousness do you actually know Hans? How do you even cheat in an over the board game? People saying he used an engine but how??? Watched his interview defending himself and he seems like a pretty genuine guy who put in a lot of hard work to get to that level and was pissed off by the accusations.,0,0.507,POSITIVE,0.862
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Tbh i didn't know Hans by name but when i opened my youtube i was shocked that i had already watched all of his video with anna cramling when he was trynna flirt with her and botez cut lil sister. I basically followed his games w/o even knowing who he is.I too believe that he isnt cheating. I mean how can you. But Chess community has gone crazy just because they now have a villian to scapegoat. I too sometimes in my game is able to beat a 1800 even though i'm a 1400-1500 Elo player. Doesnt mean im cheating lol.The only thing bothering people is :His analysis of firouza game which hikaru mocked that it isnt a 2700 analysis. Even the interviewer was beating him who is a 2500 elo player.And the other is this rumor that magnus game plan was leaked beforehand which then hans analysed before game using chess engine coz it was the first time in long time when magnus never really had a chance to win since the beginning.Also hans said in an interview he looked at the game before but ppl are arguing magnus never played this opening ever. But there is a thing in chess which is called transposition which somehow reaches same pattern about 2-3yrs ago. But analysing that just one random game out of million of magnus games is very fishy.,1,0.525,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(","Well I think it's clear he either cheated or is a genius, time will tell. Many players have beaten Magnus but not many 2600 players who couldn't explain how they did it lol.Also incase we rally earlier than expected tomorrow or off CPI next week, I think you need to add #4 to your list a popular continuation - the Sicilian Defence - stop loss trigger when close above 200dMA.",2,0.524,NEGATIVE,0.915
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",I dont think he cheated nor do i think he is a genius. He is just a lucky guy who studied an exam paper a night before and somehow found himself lucky to have the same exam paper on his test. 🤣Ofc i have my invalidation. But i dont think the situation demands to be defensive and draw like giri. We have to keep attacking with shorts like tal.,3,0.505,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

The Monday holiday is a factor in late day sell off says Bleakley's Boockvar. Watch what Apple's doing, they're the bellwether says Jmp Mark Lehman. ( September 7 guys ) You can start to dip your toes into biotech here, says Jefferies Yee. Ex : Vertex Pharma, Gilead Sciences, Immunocore Holdings, Ventyx Biosciences. US economy doesnt turn on a dime talk to me in six months says Solus Dan Greenhaus. Americans are more optimistic about the economy for the first time in 4 months. Consumer confidence is up! Stock picks for tough month (dividend stock ) : CVX (Kevin Simpson) , ABBV (Andrew Graham) Investors should expect a rainbow after the September storm. ~ Jessica Inskip Options play director of product and education ( ofc jessica Bear market rally rainbow ) Inflation hits back to school shopping as parents look to second hand clothes :_( Spaceports pop up around the country and not all communities are happy about it. ( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Ha you may be right on Hans. Usually when I attack with no SL like Tal I get crushed by the Torre market makers. Just throwing the SL thing out there for redditors who may not have read your previous posts. Also you only play the inverse etfs not options right? Very little risk of RS or contango in the near future so relatively safe compared to options. IMO timing and SL is much more important with options as they can decay to nothing quickly.Do you ever watch agadmators videos. I must have wasted over 1000 hours watching his analysis. Doing it now.,4,0.518,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Yah i totally forgot writing invalidation in this one coz it was a rushed post ( wrote two times coz first time i fogot to save )and had to get it done by tuesday.I play inverse etfs coz my exchange dont allow me to trade options. And i have a hard time trusting or switching to another platform considering liquidity is drying everywhere. And yes youre right.

,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Interesting…. Would you be short or long the NASDAQ right now ?,0,0.531,POSITIVE,0.972
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Two charts : DJI and SPX.Will dow jones exert its weakness on spx remains the case traders will be watching this week?So dow jones closed candle below 144Ema which it shouldn't have. Meanwhile Spx is hanging just above its 144Ema or you can go with trynna hold its golden pocket zone.So if you wanna play safe look for this current weekly candle close but some are speculating damage will be done this week only. Lets see. But ngl its a very tricky week.Short ans : spx $4k,1,0.513,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone.

I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",What do you think about DJX puts 09/16 290 and 300?,2,0.5,POSITIVE,0.605
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me.

I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666.

,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy !

,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",I now have a deep appreciation for PowerPoint slides and chartsThank you.,0,0.502,POSITIVE,0.999
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Thanks man. But don't blindly trust it. Beating s1 letters is not that easy. 🤣,1,0.506,NEGATIVE,0.99
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",So i guess no calls after FOMC. You did mention it might go back to 4300 b4 the October crash?So puts after or before FOMC???Hum interesting.,0,0.504,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Yes logic would say it has to be Fomc. Just think about it every time this yr we had post fomc rally. (march and june)What ? why buy puts around fomc buy now or never. The question is when you have to close them and buy call then. Just read the 3 strategies.,1,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.894
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(","The logic for me at least is, If the there is a FOMC rally I could buy at the top... and if the rally continues past October then my puts would be fucked lol.",2,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.867
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",sorry i didnt get it. Why are you even considering puts in fomc. Puts are to be considered today at spx $4k or at nov 2 to 3rd week at top of bear mkt rally 3 if it happens.😅,3,0.521,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Was thinkin a cheaper entry for puts for NOV during the FOMC rally this month.,4,0.514,NEGATIVE,0.992
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone.

Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Great post as usual. Hopefully jpow drops the mike tomorrow. I started watching the 2yr/10yr and dxy. They seem to move opposite of the market.,0,0.519,POSITIVE,0.894

So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Thanks man.Yah this pump imo by brainard is to create fake exit liq (genjutsu🤣) and then we dump tomorrow when we see powell.Yah currently dxy is falling so yields falling too coz money on sideline went into mostly bonds. But will it go into stocks lets see.,1,0.507,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(","Keep up the good work. Always love reading your stuff. Also glad to see we are on the same page. I closed out previous shorts around SPY 392, then reloaded today at SPY 398, and will add at 401/405 levels hoping we don’t see much higher than that. Oct 21 expiry, but looking to close by early Oct.",0,0.525,POSITIVE,0.929
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Haha. Lets see. Spx closing daily candle above $4068 will be something i'm not expecting. But I have a feeling that your puts will print.😁👍,1,0.531,POSITIVE,0.874
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy !

,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Thanks for the DD. I should've listened to you when you predicted the July rally. Instead my puts that I could've sold at the June bottom at 200% expired mostly worthless. Hope I don't fuck it up this time.I've reloaded my puts and so far looking pretty good. We bounced off the daily 200 EMA like you said. Ready to ride this bitch all the way down.,0,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Haha. Lets see wht happens. Fireworks should start today.,1,0.517,POSITIVE,0.807
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",👌,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.761
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",the 4th weekly red close was jinxed so hard it ain’t even funny.

,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",I think you didnt saw the chart. The 4th weekly candle is a doji. Also spx still hasn't closed candle above $4065 on daily.,1,0.52,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone.

Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",We gon keep going up or puts now?,0,0.51,NEGATIVE,0.995

How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",the latter obviously. But hey that's my perspective. So advise to dyor.P.s : Rn we are going up due to 8.1% cpi exp for next week. So buy the rumor.,1,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.996
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",CPI tuesday. Planning for spx puts Monday.,2,0.511,NEGATIVE,0.987
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",I like the plan unless something gets ruined before monday morning and we have -5% index futures. lol🤣,3,0.502,POSITIVE,0.698
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Puts just because of overall macro? CPI forecast/consensus both say 8.1 is chill; still irrational imo but the latest rally makes me curious if bulls will just fake it till they make itGreat write up btw; love and appreciate your sagas,2,0.507,NEGATIVE,0.97
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",No its just a hunch something will blow up next week and we go downtown till powell fomc. Even earnings exp has came down.Thanks man.,3,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",I work in cybersecurity and appreciate your CRWD commentary and institutional codes 🤣,0,0.503,POSITIVE,0.993
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Wooah. If i were you i would pretty pissed seeing those java codes instead of python.🤣,1,0.504,NEGATIVE,0.997
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",well that was a long winded way to say “i’m regarded”,0,0.536,NEGATIVE,0.54
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Yah i have fuckin lost it. Its gonna be last post ig if June lows doesnt work out.,1,0.514,NEGATIVE,0.981
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down.

I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Wtf mods please put a max chars limit,0,0.499,NEGATIVE,0.974

Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

( Really pop at my place. Our community will be so much happy ) Omfg. That was super boring as hell. Sorry guys if i made you sleepy. If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",Dude are you new here coz everybody knows my posts are even bigger than this😂,1,0.546,NEGATIVE,0.997
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",if only i could read,0,0.52,POSITIVE,0.65
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",So any suggestions how to work this out?,1,0.508,NEGATIVE,0.994
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

If you manage to make it this far trust me from here things will be interesting :) Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street : Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street. 1. Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(",TIL there is apparently no character limit in posts here lol.,0,0.497,NEGATIVE,0.966
,"“Those who do not understand the true pain of a “Bear market can never understand the true peace that exists within a “Bull Market” Disclaimer : ""I really really really wanna apologize to you all guys because i was suppose to send this newsletter first thing on Monday. But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022"" So moving on... This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this “Stagflationary” and then later on “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. ) * Enter Conference room 1 Me : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend” Investors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha” Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” Investors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?” Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read ""Four Research paper"" post. Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%. Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ” Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that. But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio. Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment” Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis” Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character” Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical” Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before” Me : “That’s correct” Investors : “You’re out of your f mind** Walk away from the conference room. Me : *Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello” Secretary : “They are here” Me : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2. I am coming” Strategist vs Trader * Enter conference room 2 Me : “Sit down. Nobody talks today” Traders : “He is not greeting us today” Me : “Divide yourself into two groups of traders who took trades and profited & the ones who missed entry” Traders : ….. …… Me -> Traders who missed entry “Guys how could you miss the f’in entry when i clearly told you the levels to place your shorts before Jackson Hole. I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the ""Danzo vs Sasuke"" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ? Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about. Trader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 ) and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments ) Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too” Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ? Trader 1 : * Silent Me : “Yah i guessed so. **After calming down Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data. So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones. I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “ Me -> Traders who made profits. Trader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.” Me : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now” Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :) Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention. So at last finally moving on... Respected Investors and Traders, ""Pain = Gain"" if you're bearish. XD How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn’t well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD God it has been quite a while hasn’t it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content. I got many Dm’s that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys “ Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching” Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat.

Johnny Wall Street If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex. My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short. 2. Lax Boy This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss. 3. The Bionic Woman I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks. 4. The Guy without a GPS He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends. 5. The Crusty Old Dude Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted. 6. Somebody's Sister She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake. 7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil? 8. The Husband Hunter This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.) 9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him. 10. Austin Powers He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him. 11. I'm Doing God's Work Man He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day. 12. The Unusual Suspect He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train. Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe. Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ? ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift ) Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? ) 1. Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy : SPY QQQ Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife ) So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339 QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231 2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy : sp500Candles() : This function is being followed right now nasdaqCompositeCandles () : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event. So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only ) String Powell = “ “; // Current status : Himself Int u = x; ( x = current cpi ) If ( Powell = “Himself” ){ copytrade(sp500Candles() ); // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week ( Most likely ) } else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){ copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () ); // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. } else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){ if( u < 8.6 ) { NasdaqUp( ); // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation ) SpxUp( ); } else { NasdaqDown( ); // 1970-71 times ( Reinflation ) SpxDown( ); } } Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously. 3. Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles(); Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles() on weekly time frame I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters. Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD Buy zones : Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week. And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :) Sell zones : Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week. Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets. Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have. 4. Illuminati trading strategy : ( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 ) So as you all know my brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will. Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page. - 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor ) 2008 vs 2001 - 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. - 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september. 1994 - 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on ) 1987 vs 1980 - 1987 : Black Monday crash - 1980 : Volcker crash 1973 vs 1966 - 1973 : Arthur got burned - 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war. Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :) Note : I have discounted the ""Noob level strategy"" by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing. Result : How to use this info ? We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before. He played with ""Black"" btw and attacked. 1. Strategy 1 : Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward ) Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share. Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : Fed Fomc sept 20. and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week 2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward ) I love this strategy Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen ) and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week. 3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward ) Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens ) not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers. Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others. Risk of September 2022 : Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears. Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets. Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666. September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23. Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before. So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD Be humble ! Stay safe ! Eat healthy ! Thank you Regards Uchiha P.s. I know this post suck so much that i too wanna vomit because these things are already repeated. But that is exactly i wanna teach you. Keep believing these analysis and the prophecy might just come true :) Calling to Kei : How do i bring my motivation back. :(","What percentage of your portfolio is in inverse etf? How do you determine your risk management in times like this? Thanks for the great newsletters, I read them two or three times to fully understand them, but I take away useful things for me! Good luck and thanks again !",0,0.519,NEGATIVE,0.871
