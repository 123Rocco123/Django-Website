Have you ever known governments to be casual about taxes? To forego potential revenue just because they are nice?Didn't think so.The main issue is, that Airbnb hosts are operating as businesses despite paying residential tax.Once hotels start dieing and the tax revenue comes down, governments will reclassify airbnbs as hotels, make them pay for rezoning and tax them as businesses.This will be detrimental to the vast majority of hosts.What this means is that airbnb is trapped in this weird place, where if they become too successful they kill themselves.And that is why they will never dominate their field like google or amazon do.agreed on doordash though, what a steaming shitpile of an excuse of a company.Also probs for shilling PLTR earlyish on.
