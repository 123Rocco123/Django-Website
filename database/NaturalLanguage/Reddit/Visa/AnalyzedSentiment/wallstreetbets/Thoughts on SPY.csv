,"While writing this, SPY's ten year trend line has been broken. This leaves 250 as the next point of resistance. If 250 is broken, u/Variation-Separate could be spot on with his 269 rally prediction. I expect Friday's unemployment numbers to affect the current trend (https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/laus.htm). Everyone expects the numbers to be bad, so it's a matter of how bad. If the numbers are not too bad it could actually help this rally, however if they're awful it may halt or reverse the rally. Right now estimates sit between 1 million and 2.5 million unemployed. I am starting to feel COVID is getting closer to being priced in. I am starting to doubt we see SPY reach $200/share. The sectors that will be hit the hardest have already taken -50+% losses and the companies that can survive the pandemic are beginning to level off or rise. I was too young to experience the 2008 housing crisis however I do not look at this as a similar situation. Based off of what I've heard, people were in denial of the housing bubble fucking the economy in 2008. Today, people are aware of the problems facing the economy and many of the companies that will be affected most by COVID have already taken heavy losses. It looks like Visa, MasterCard, AAPL, and real estate is keeping the S&P in the green. Airlines are also doing pretty great. Communication services, IT, health care, and AMZN are struggling. Removed screenshot because it had my personal info. I will add one back later. (Screenshot taken at 11:42 EST) - Visa seems to be following Mastercard similar to how Lyft is following Uber. Yesterday MA issued a second COVID-19 revenue warning causing a red day slower growth than the S&P500. Today marks a record breaking green day for the two so plenty of investors feel comfortable jumping aboard despite the COVID-19 revenue warnings. I don't expect V and MA to prop up the S&P any further tomorrow. Green will have to come from elsewhere if the rally is to continue to 270, however I don't expect V or MA to hold the S&P back from the rally. - Deutsche bank analyst Jeriel Ong believes now is the time to buy AAPL with a price target of $270 (from $290). He sees risks such as store closures and supply chain delays as short term problems. Ong is relying on the incoming 5G IPhone cycle to drive strong growth. I highly doubt AAPL will be holding back the S&P from rallying. Investors plan on staying for the long term. - Real Estate seems to be green primarily due to the promise of an economic relief package passing. This green is heavily reliant on the relief package passing in the senate. The same is true for airlines. I expect the bill to pass today. Sen. Dick Derbin (Minority whip) is very excited about the bill. Watch the live stream here: https://www.c-span.org/video/?470652-1/senate-expected-vote-coronavirus-economic-relief-bill&live - Communication Services (Google and Facebook) are strong. I am confident Google will not be impacted very heavily by COVID-19. Today's red day is temporary. They make money from providing advertisements and can artificially modify their supply by showing less or more advertisements to fit any demand. They are clearly confident in their ability to weather this storm because they just extended contracts for contracted employees by 90 days. They also have funds to help part time workers. FB will be weaker than Google but I expect them to also be fine. - Amazon stopped taking orders in India for the next 21 days due to the country wide lock down. They are also only accepting essential items at their warehouses in the US. With the expected spike in unemployed, I see a decline in online shopping despite more people staying at home. I expect this to continue weighing down the stock while COVID spreads. - Consumer Staples (Walmart, PG, etc) are fairly neutral today however I expect COVID to continue weighing negatively on these companies. I doubt they rise anytime soon. They may continue falling. I'm not sure if it will be enough to bring down the entire index. - I'm not very familiar with our health care system so cannot at this time provide much DD on this sector. I also haven't mentioned anything about the Financials, Industrials, Utilities, Energy, or Materials sectors of the S&P500 because I don't know shit about them.

It looks like Visa, MasterCard, AAPL, and real estate is keeping the S&P in the green. Airlines are also doing pretty great. Communication services, IT, health care, and AMZN are struggling. Removed screenshot because it had my personal info. I will add one back later. (Screenshot taken at 11:42 EST) - Visa seems to be following Mastercard similar to how Lyft is following Uber. Yesterday MA issued a second COVID-19 revenue warning causing a red day slower growth than the S&P500. Today marks a record breaking green day for the two so plenty of investors feel comfortable jumping aboard despite the COVID-19 revenue warnings. I don't expect V and MA to prop up the S&P any further tomorrow. Green will have to come from elsewhere if the rally is to continue to 270, however I don't expect V or MA to hold the S&P back from the rally. - Deutsche bank analyst Jeriel Ong believes now is the time to buy AAPL with a price target of $270 (from $290). He sees risks such as store closures and supply chain delays as short term problems. Ong is relying on the incoming 5G IPhone cycle to drive strong growth. I highly doubt AAPL will be holding back the S&P from rallying. Investors plan on staying for the long term. - Real Estate seems to be green primarily due to the promise of an economic relief package passing. This green is heavily reliant on the relief package passing in the senate. The same is true for airlines. I expect the bill to pass today. Sen. Dick Derbin (Minority whip) is very excited about the bill.

I am confident Google will not be impacted very heavily by COVID-19. Today's red day is temporary. They make money from providing advertisements and can artificially modify their supply by showing less or more advertisements to fit any demand. They are clearly confident in their ability to weather this storm because they just extended contracts for contracted employees by 90 days. They also have funds to help part time workers. FB will be weaker than Google but I expect them to also be fine. - Amazon stopped taking orders in India for the next 21 days due to the country wide lock down. They are also only accepting essential items at their warehouses in the US. With the expected spike in unemployed, I see a decline in online shopping despite more people staying at home. I expect this to continue weighing down the stock while COVID spreads. - Consumer Staples (Walmart, PG, etc) are fairly neutral today however I expect COVID to continue weighing negatively on these companies. I doubt they rise anytime soon. They may continue falling. I'm not sure if it will be enough to bring down the entire index. - I'm not very familiar with our health care system so cannot at this time provide much DD on this sector. I also haven't mentioned anything about the Financials, Industrials, Utilities, Energy, or Materials sectors of the S&P500 because I don't know shit about them.

Removed screenshot because it had my personal info. I will add one back later. (Screenshot taken at 11:42 EST) - Visa seems to be following Mastercard similar to how Lyft is following Uber. Yesterday MA issued a second COVID-19 revenue warning causing a red day slower growth than the S&P500. Today marks a record breaking green day for the two so plenty of investors feel comfortable jumping aboard despite the COVID-19 revenue warnings. I don't expect V and MA to prop up the S&P any further tomorrow. Green will have to come from elsewhere if the rally is to continue to 270, however I don't expect V or MA to hold the S&P back from the rally. - Deutsche bank analyst Jeriel Ong believes now is the time to buy AAPL with a price target of $270 (from $290). He sees risks such as store closures and supply chain delays as short term problems. Ong is relying on the incoming 5G IPhone cycle to drive strong growth. I highly doubt AAPL will be holding back the S&P from rallying. Investors plan on staying for the long term. - Real Estate seems to be green primarily due to the promise of an economic relief package passing. This green is heavily reliant on the relief package passing in the senate. The same is true for airlines. I expect the bill to pass today. Sen. Dick Derbin (Minority whip) is very excited about the bill.

I am confident Google will not be impacted very heavily by COVID-19. Today's red day is temporary. They make money from providing advertisements and can artificially modify their supply by showing less or more advertisements to fit any demand. They are clearly confident in their ability to weather this storm because they just extended contracts for contracted employees by 90 days. They also have funds to help part time workers. FB will be weaker than Google but I expect them to also be fine. - Amazon stopped taking orders in India for the next 21 days due to the country wide lock down. They are also only accepting essential items at their warehouses in the US. With the expected spike in unemployed, I see a decline in online shopping despite more people staying at home. I expect this to continue weighing down the stock while COVID spreads. - Consumer Staples (Walmart, PG, etc) are fairly neutral today however I expect COVID to continue weighing negatively on these companies. I doubt they rise anytime soon. They may continue falling.

Yesterday MA issued a second COVID-19 revenue warning causing a red day slower growth than the S&P500. Today marks a record breaking green day for the two so plenty of investors feel comfortable jumping aboard despite the COVID-19 revenue warnings. I don't expect V and MA to prop up the S&P any further tomorrow. Green will have to come from elsewhere if the rally is to continue to 270, however I don't expect V or MA to hold the S&P back from the rally. - Deutsche bank analyst Jeriel Ong believes now is the time to buy AAPL with a price target of $270 (from $290). He sees risks such as store closures and supply chain delays as short term problems. Ong is relying on the incoming 5G IPhone cycle to drive strong growth. I highly doubt AAPL will be holding back the S&P from rallying.

They make money from providing advertisements and can artificially modify their supply by showing less or more advertisements to fit any demand.

Yesterday MA issued a second COVID-19 revenue warning causing a red day slower growth than the S&P500. Today marks a record breaking green day for the two so plenty of investors feel comfortable jumping aboard despite the COVID-19 revenue warnings. I don't expect V and MA to prop up the S&P any further tomorrow. Green will have to come from elsewhere if the rally is to continue to 270, however I don't expect V or MA to hold the S&P back from the rally. - Deutsche bank analyst Jeriel Ong believes now is the time to buy AAPL with a price target of $270 (from $290). He sees risks such as store closures and supply chain delays as short term problems. Ong is relying on the incoming 5G IPhone cycle to drive strong growth. I highly doubt AAPL will be holding back the S&P from rallying.

They make money from providing advertisements and can artificially modify their supply by showing less or more advertisements to fit any demand.

It looks like Visa, MasterCard, AAPL, and real estate is keeping the S&P in the green. Airlines are also doing pretty great. Communication services, IT, health care, and AMZN are struggling. Removed screenshot because it had my personal info. I will add one back later. (Screenshot taken at 11:42 EST) - Visa seems to be following Mastercard similar to how Lyft is following Uber. Yesterday MA issued a second COVID-19 revenue warning causing a red day slower growth than the S&P500. Today marks a record breaking green day for the two so plenty of investors feel comfortable jumping aboard despite the COVID-19 revenue warnings. I don't expect V and MA to prop up the S&P any further tomorrow. Green will have to come from elsewhere if the rally is to continue to 270, however I don't expect V or MA to hold the S&P back from the rally. - Deutsche bank analyst Jeriel Ong believes now is the time to buy AAPL with a price target of $270 (from $290). He sees risks such as store closures and supply chain delays as short term problems. Ong is relying on the incoming 5G IPhone cycle to drive strong growth. I highly doubt AAPL will be holding back the S&P from rallying. Investors plan on staying for the long term. - Real Estate seems to be green primarily due to the promise of an economic relief package passing. This green is heavily reliant on the relief package passing in the senate. The same is true for airlines. I expect the bill to pass today. Sen. Dick Derbin (Minority whip) is very excited about the bill.

I am confident Google will not be impacted very heavily by COVID-19. Today's red day is temporary. They make money from providing advertisements and can artificially modify their supply by showing less or more advertisements to fit any demand. They are clearly confident in their ability to weather this storm because they just extended contracts for contracted employees by 90 days. They also have funds to help part time workers. FB will be weaker than Google but I expect them to also be fine. - Amazon stopped taking orders in India for the next 21 days due to the country wide lock down. They are also only accepting essential items at their warehouses in the US. With the expected spike in unemployed, I see a decline in online shopping despite more people staying at home. I expect this to continue weighing down the stock while COVID spreads. - Consumer Staples (Walmart, PG, etc) are fairly neutral today however I expect COVID to continue weighing negatively on these companies. I doubt they rise anytime soon. They may continue falling. I'm not sure if it will be enough to bring down the entire index. - I'm not very familiar with our health care system so cannot at this time provide much DD on this sector. I also haven't mentioned anything about the Financials, Industrials, Utilities, Energy, or Materials sectors of the S&P500 because I don't know shit about them.

,"While writing this, SPY's ten year trend line has been broken. This leaves 250 as the next point of resistance. If 250 is broken, u/Variation-Separate could be spot on with his 269 rally prediction. I expect Friday's unemployment numbers to affect the current trend (https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/laus.htm). Everyone expects the numbers to be bad, so it's a matter of how bad. If the numbers are not too bad it could actually help this rally, however if they're awful it may halt or reverse the rally. Right now estimates sit between 1 million and 2.5 million unemployed. I am starting to feel COVID is getting closer to being priced in. I am starting to doubt we see SPY reach $200/share. The sectors that will be hit the hardest have already taken -50+% losses and the companies that can survive the pandemic are beginning to level off or rise. I was too young to experience the 2008 housing crisis however I do not look at this as a similar situation.
