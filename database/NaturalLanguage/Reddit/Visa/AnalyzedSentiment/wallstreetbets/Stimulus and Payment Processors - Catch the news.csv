,"I think there is a big way to make consistent money similar to trade deals and corona virus hype that people are not exploiting yet. Everytime stimulus news is brought up, payment providers rally. You can see this inPaypal, Visa, and Square right now. This is partially lead to SQ reaching all time highs and Paypal and Visa to be close as well. Even though in contact payments from SQ is down, they have converted successfully via cashapp to online movements. Looking at some flow, look at $SQ’s run on Friday: https://gyazo.com/1eb2621dfb91c6e1e72b6380464e48cf This is despite the news of a wavering stimulus. In fact, it looks like option flow is heading that way on these payment providers like paypal with big movements happening earlier this month in anticipation of the stimulus. Paypal and Visa are looking a little beat up in comparison, but I think the flow will hit them too. I suspect Monday/Tuesday we get a lot of talk about the stimulus after the weekend and Trump’s Friday offers. Plus pressure from the populace to make a deal happen. For example, Trump may go bigger than a 2.2 trillion COVID stimulus. As result, some positions I have: PYPL $202 call 10/30 and SQ $220 call 10/23, and I am bullish on all payment companies as a result.

I suspect Monday/Tuesday we get a lot of talk about the stimulus after the weekend and Trump’s Friday offers. Plus pressure from the populace to make a deal happen. For example, Trump may go bigger than a 2.2 trillion COVID stimulus. As result, some positions I have: PYPL $202 call 10/30 and SQ $220 call 10/23, and I am bullish on all payment companies as a result. What do you guys think?","Yeah, I have not looked at Paypal in a while. I can definitely understand your point and it looks as if a runup could happen as it is playing off of 50ema consistently and showing consolidation.",0,0.503,0.927,NEGATIVE
,"I think there is a big way to make consistent money similar to trade deals and corona virus hype that people are not exploiting yet. Everytime stimulus news is brought up, payment providers rally. You can see this inPaypal, Visa, and Square right now. This is partially lead to SQ reaching all time highs and Paypal and Visa to be close as well. Even though in contact payments from SQ is down, they have converted successfully via cashapp to online movements. Looking at some flow, look at $SQ’s run on Friday: https://gyazo.com/1eb2621dfb91c6e1e72b6380464e48cf This is despite the news of a wavering stimulus. In fact, it looks like option flow is heading that way on these payment providers like paypal with big movements happening earlier this month in anticipation of the stimulus. Paypal and Visa are looking a little beat up in comparison, but I think the flow will hit them too.
