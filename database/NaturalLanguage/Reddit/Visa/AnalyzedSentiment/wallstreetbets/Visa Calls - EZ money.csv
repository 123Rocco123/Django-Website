,"I’m up over 61% on the month and 121% in the past 3 months. I legitimately only buy visa calls and sell the next day, strictly no day trading. I just buy on the dips and keep averaging down and then sell the next day or a couple days after. Visa always bounces back to the 175-180 range. I know this is low quality DD but I believe it’s better to trade what you know than a large amount of companies that you don’t know shit about.

You could say what I said about Apple, I just like that Visa is less exposed to Chinese tariffs and doesn’t fluctuate as much as Apple so I can get higher delta without paying out the ying due to IV",1,0.54,0.858,POSITIVE
