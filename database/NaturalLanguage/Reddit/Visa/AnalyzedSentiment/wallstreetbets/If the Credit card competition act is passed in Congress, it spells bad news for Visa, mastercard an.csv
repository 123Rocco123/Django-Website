,,"So I work at a bank and we think this will be horrible for Visa and Mastercard, mostly neutral for the banks and horrible for consumers that have rewards credit cards. Banks don't make much money on interchange, they pass on most of the interchange on to the card holder as rewards. All rewards cards point earn rate would probably drop 40% to 60%. The only winners would be the merchants, they get to keep the money that would have gone to the rewards card holder and they won't decrease prices, just like how they didn't decrease the prices like they promised after the Durbin amendment.People with non-rewards cards probably will also get fucked because the banks will probably add or increase the annual fee to make up for lost interchange fees.",0,0.516,NEGATIVE,1.0

,,"The duopoly isn't built on interchange fees. It's built on network effects. Those are incredibly difficult to breach.Think Bell Telephone (later AT&T), Microsoft, Facebook. Every additional user rolls into the positive feedback loop.As a merchant, are you going to accept Mastercard and Visa, which has enormous penetration worldwide, or some card with 1/10th of a percent market penetration?There has to be a widespread, compelling reason to switch networks. When it was Geocities/Tripod/etc. into the first big blogging network, Myspace, the reason was Myspace being an entirely plug and play network. You create an account, you're in - instantly. It was seamless. There were no web rings to join, no guestbooks, forums, or any other additional hurdles. One and done. Add your friends with a click.When the transition from MySpace to Facebook happened, it was generational. A new generation of college kids wanted a more private place to plan parties, share pictures, gossip, etc. That facebook had other technically superior aspects to the platform helped, but it wasn't the incremental technology advancement that gave Facebook momentum. If that were the case, why did Google Plus fail so badly? It wasn't a bad platform in a technical sense.Similar with Instagram, and now Tik Tok. Kids naturally want space outside of their parents purview, so each generation has a built in 'rebellion' response to what their parents use.It's like a tree fort, updated for the 2000's.That generational shift didn't exist with telephones, because the telephone is already a private mechanism. Unless we go way back to when party phone lines were common, the telephone is already private between two parties. A teenager could chat with a friend from the privacy of a bedroom. There were incremental advancements, but nothing which blew the gates wide open until the advent of ICQ/MSN/AIM/etc. Then the young generation made the communication switch. That was the precursor to wide spread cell phone & text messaging.",2,0.519,POSITIVE,0.636
,,"Yes, it would allow a few networks to grow. I think there are a few tiny processors that only do debit now that would be able to enter the credit card market and grow rapidly. The regulation forces every credit card to have two processors (one of which can't be MC or Visa) and the merchant gets to pick which one processes the transaction. So if the small networks come in and offer to do the transaction for 1.25% but MC is charging the 2.25% then the merchant will pick the little guy and save 1%. The little processor will have a game theory competition to have the highest interchange of the little processors but low enough below V and MC that they are still picked by the merchant. Remember that the little processor still has to be picked by the bank to be the second processor. If V and MC have 2.25% interchange and most little guys charge 1.25% but there is one little guy charging 1.75% then every bank will choose the one with 1.75% to be the second processor because they get an extra 0.50% of interchange.",2,0.519,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"We exclusively use CC's for the rewards (and to make sure fraud doesn't mean we lose our money). We pay in full monthly, this would suck big time, and no the savings won't make it to the customer, that's not how it works.
