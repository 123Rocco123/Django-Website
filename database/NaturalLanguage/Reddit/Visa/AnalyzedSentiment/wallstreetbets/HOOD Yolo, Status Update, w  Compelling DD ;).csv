,"Fuck yes, my very first r/wsb post, I'm excited to get downvoted to dust. Yes, this is Vlad the Impaler :) Here's my YOLO position in one of the most innovative fintech companies. A few things I believe to kick things off: (1) There are few golden / universal rules in gambling, and screenshot to close is not one of them lol. (2) I don't know everything, and it's awesome. I've been riding this stock since Q2 2023, switched to options late 23, then went even harder into options early 24. I'm long on the intrinsic value of the company, so I put my money where my mouth is. Here's my DD: Last quarter RH reported profits to the surprise of the entire market who projected them losing money (beat expectations by 21x in some instances). Half of revenue came from interest earnings, which again, was to the surprise of Wall Street bc ppl still see this as a meme company that only makes money from regarded option plays, like mine. Read any article and few point this out. Revenue is diversifying and assets under management is spiking. The high interest rate environment promotes this trend. RH offers high-yield 5% checking accounts. Just park your money there and you earn, and they earn from the arbitrage. Banks are ripping millions of ppl off with .025% savings rates, so I see a lot of growth opportunities here. IDK why laymen don't understand that FDIC secured means FDIC secured, regardless of the institution/bank holding the bag. RH announced credit card and to no surprise, Wall Street is still offsides here, because no one is reporting on the innovation being built in partnership with VISA, THE VISA. Here's the quick summary: RH credit cards will allow you to create / destroy unlimited virtual cards, so you can sign up to unlimited free trials, gym memberships, etc and cancel the virtual card if the service provider is lame or gets pesky. I totally respect r/wsb, but you regarded dudes still hate this company for the wrong reasons. They did not collude with citadel. Pls pls pls watch this episode of All in podcast where the hosts try to grill Vlad the Impaler: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU. If you hate Robinhood, at least hate it for the right reason: the company simply grew too fast, that's it, nothing malicious. The gravy train has room to run because institutions like VC and PE equity are holding this since IPO, they will not sell until they are at least at IPO price in my regarded opinion. And because this company is building a strong mix of genuinely useful and valuable financial products for the masses in US and a bit abroad in UK. Here's their mix of financial products for non-regards: (1) Retirement IRA with 1% match (this is revolutionary, but no one will say it), (2) high yield checking account 5% with RH gold, (3) Gold credit card with 3% back on all categories and 5% on travel with their travel platform. Last but not least, $HOOD has a compelling and addicting platform for all of us gamblers. Do you all seriously believe this insane bull run of stocks, options, bonds, and crypto will not show up on Robinhood's next earnings? Literally everything under the sun is up 200%. No speculation at all here, right, naked options are completely safe right?? Lol jk jk. My position is still open and I'm bullish on long-term intrinsic value. I can elaborate on these bullets, so please roast me in the comments. Also want to add that I've been taking screenshots and sharing with friends and fam for a few months to try to reverse the pattern so I can buy in lower, but it's not working. Hopefully this screenshot, that appears to be my first to wsb, will help ;) Also, I expect a few smaller leaps upward, especially if they continue publishing monthly metrics. I also expect next earnings in may to be blockbuster. My ultimate price target is $40 by 2026. I see nothing keeping this stock and company from reclaiming its IPO price and above in two years. Yours truly Fellow Regard, Position as of this week - let me know if y'all want the average costs for each contract.

Half of revenue came from interest earnings, which again, was to the surprise of Wall Street bc ppl still see this as a meme company that only makes money from regarded option plays, like mine. Read any article and few point this out. Revenue is diversifying and assets under management is spiking. The high interest rate environment promotes this trend. RH offers high-yield 5% checking accounts. Just park your money there and you earn, and they earn from the arbitrage.

Bitcoin prediction are seeming to land somewhere in the 120-140k range. With ibit similarly following bitcoins trend line and an gain of like 60percent isn't not crazy to think that this stock has the potential to out perform bitcoins bull run based on the simple fact that it's not over bought yet. Cause from what I see ibit could do potentially 3xvs bitcoins two x. In addition we have the fact that ibit is most poplar etf at the moment.
