,"Interesting Trend - Analyzed two companies with different compositions of institutional stock ownerships $AAPL - 58.21% vs $V (Visa) - 94.10% and looked at how the social media sentiments correlate with the price. Noticed that the price vs sentiment correlation was more positive for $AAPL than it was for $V (Visa). Do you think that the more a stock is owned by the institutions, the less prone that stock is to the social media sentiments ?","sample of 2 isn't statistically meaningful.institutional investors also use sentiment analysis, but for shorter term investments.sentiment may really just be a signal of hold horizon.also, time lag will vary, so cointegration may be a more useful metric than correlation.",0,0.537,NEGATIVE,1.0
