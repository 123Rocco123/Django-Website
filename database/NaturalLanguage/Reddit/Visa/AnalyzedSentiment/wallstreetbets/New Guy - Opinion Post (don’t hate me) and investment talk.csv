,"New Guy Lurker for a decade, formally joined/downloaded the mobile app a month ago.I fear the media attention will require that I do even more DD on every person posting in the future which is sad. Anyways, that’s all. If anyone has tips on how to easily see who to trust or not I’d love to be able to filter out the noise. Best of luck to the GME holders and the rest of you. 👊🏼 ⚽️ On a lighter note. I put out a call yesterday on Visa that is doing well, curious if anyone has opinions on how long to hold. (Edit: expiration is in just 1 month) 🤘🏼Also started recurring investments on SQ and PYPL to hedge success (or failure) or electronic money, as I feel they’re poised well either way. 👍🏼Lastly, I have a sneaking suspicion we could all do well riding PENN and DKNG up up up. I am heavy into DKNG right now but I feel like the PENN guys have a stranglehold on their market with all of the chads and bros out there (free advertising every day through barstool social media) Open to feedback!","Take DD’s that you can tell are well researched, get interested in the company, dive into the company yourself, make investments. There is some work on your end too",0,0.627,NEGATIVE,0.756
