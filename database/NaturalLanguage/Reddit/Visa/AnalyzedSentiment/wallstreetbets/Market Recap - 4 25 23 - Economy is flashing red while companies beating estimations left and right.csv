,"The Fed TLDR, CBs are on schedule to tighten liquidity, bad for stonks. As I mentioned in the weekend post, global liquidity is scheduled to be tightened again after the banking crisis in Q1. Fitch: ECB is likely to pick up the pace of so-called quantitative tightening (QT) in July. Money supply continues to decline in the US. As I have mentioned many times in my posts, liquidity is a very important leading indicator which should be closely monitored. The Economy TLDR, More bad news for the economy. I am still not convinced that a recession is coming (as I mentioned yesterday, consumers and businesses balance sheets are still very strong), but the outlook is certainly more and more gloomy. The Richmond Fed survey was released this morning. I am adding it to my table. Compared to other surveys, this is straight up bad. Not only are activities slowing down again, but prices paid/received are higher as well. It's a taste of stagflation."" US Conference Board consumer confidence is down to 101.3 vs 104.0 last month. “While consumers’ relatively favorable assessment of the current business environment improved somewhat in April, their expectations fell and remain below the level which often signals a recession looming in the short-term,” “Consumers became more pessimistic about the outlook for both business conditions and labor markets.” “Overall purchasing plans for homes, autos, appliances, and vacations all pulled back in April, a signal that consumers may be economizing amid growing pessimism.” Like I said yesterday, “consumers are financially in great shape, except nobody believes that they are!” Anecdotally, I picked up on charts on Twitter that freight and 3PLs have slowed down significantly for the past few weeks. Quote:""I mean, in 2008, it wasn't as bad/slow as it is now. Many carriers are going out of business in recent months"". I'm not sure how reliable this is or how much is due to the bullwhip effect from capacity expansion during COVID, but clearly, economic activities have been cooling and potentially accelerating to the downside. There isn't much being reflected in the economic data yet, but it's worth keeping an eye on. The commodities market, including copper, oil, soy, wheat, etc., is turning around from recent rally this week, especially today. If this trend continues, it may indicate a gloomy economic condition up ahead. The Business TLDR, Overall, very strong earnings results today. Consumer staples (PE, MCD, CME, and KO yesterday) are very stable, and consumer discretionary is doing fantastic. This does not look like a weak economy to me. The only weakness came from transportation and industry (UPS and MMM), which signals some potential trouble ahead. After market close, both GOOG and MSFT beat expectations, but MSFT was in a much better position than GOOG (ad revenue barely beat and cloud actually missed). I still believe that Large Growth will be the best investment style for the rest of the year. UPS missed both the top and bottom lines and guided lower as well. This is actually good news for disinflation (maybe some AMZN/SHOP puts?). Additionally, UPS and FedEx deferred volume is down significantly, which is another piece of evidence that spending on goods is slowing down (although it still just looks like a bullwhip phenomenon to me). Pepsico beat both top and bottom lines and guided higher. Most of the growth really came from inflation, but at least consumers are not cutting back on snacks yet. Similar observations from McDonald's, Coca Cola, and Chipotle. One important piece of information from Pepsico earnings call is that there will be no more price increases (most likely) for the rest of the year (good for disinflation). GM beat earnings estimates and guided higher. This is a bit surprising, especially considering that Whirlpool also beat expectations. In fact, the whole consumer discretionary sector was doing very well in Q1. This really is something you wouldn't expect to see if the economy is weakening. McDonald's beat earnings but missed revenue. However, they are now anticipating a recession as revenue per single order dropped and price resistance from dinners increased. Visa confirmed that consumer spending is still very strong, with a 10% growth in payment volume. And I was right yesterday about the massive short position. All hedges. Hedge funds are actually net long. My positions have not changed from yesterday.",Love these DD posts. Been reading daily and hope you keep doing these.,0,0.508,POSITIVE,0.98
