,"Has anyone else considered buying or has already bought Visa calls anticipating they’ll have a huge pump from Daddy Powell? I saw a lot of companies jump before their earnings recently and have yet to see Visa follow. This is might look like a solid time to get in before a possible pump.

Now fast forward to Q1 2020, do you think amidst a pandemic payment volumes would still be increasing when we see many small businesses shutting down they are losing interchange fees (around 1.5-3.5% per transaction) and chances are they won't be repurchasing any more shares just to bolster the stock prices anytime soon.So going into the Q1 earnings you can reliably predict the share prices to stay suppressed. Would they go down that's anyone's guess but the very least there doesn't seem to be any fundamental forces that would make VISA go up, aside from broad market appreciation. If people are buying up the whole market then anything goes.",0,0.527,0.991,NEGATIVE
