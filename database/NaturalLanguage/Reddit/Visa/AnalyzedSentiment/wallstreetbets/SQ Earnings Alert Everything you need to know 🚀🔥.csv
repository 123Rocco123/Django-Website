,"So I'm not really too sure what I wanna do with Square. Many technology stocks have outperformed in 2023 amid buzz over artificial intelligence tech. I don't know if you guys noticed, but Square's parent company Block (SQ) has kinda been left out of the party. For digital payment processor Block, the growth trajectory of Square's consumer Cash App is one issue. There's also cryptocurrency Bitcoin and the Afterpay acquisition. Also, Square faces growing competition on many fronts. For earnings, it seems like analysts are estimating an adjusted profit of 47 cents, up 12% from a year earlier. Revenue, including Bitcoin transactions, will rise 20% to $4.52 billion, analysts estimate. Gross profit is expected to grow 21% to $1.895 billion. Meanwhile, Square stock has plunged 36% so far in 2023 (lol), even as Nasdaq surged nearly 22%. Merchant Business Pressured Block recently replaced the head of its merchant Square business, Alyssa Henry, with Block founder Jack Dorsey. You know, the guy who founded twitter. He's bald now. In its core businesses, Square stock aims to build a two-sided digital payments ecosystem, with products designed for both merchant sellers and consumer buyers. According to UBS analyst Rayna Kuma, they face slowing growth for its consumer Cash App in 2024, written in a recent note to clients. See, I'm worried about potential weakness in Square's point-of-sale business amid growing competitive pressures from Toast (TOST) in restaurants and Fiserv's (FISV) Clover unit generally. At Wolfe Research, analyst Darrin Peller focused on gross profits in a recent report. Gross margin is how much a company earns from revenue before subtracting operating expenses, taxes and interest. Peller said the Square business needs to expand faster internationally, a move that could improve profitability. Key Details Square and Marqeta (MQ) on Aug. 8 said they have renewed their transaction services agreement for Cash App and Afterpay. In July, Block sued Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) on antitrust grounds, alleging that both credit card networks are overcharging U.S. merchants through high cost interchange and merchant location fees. Jack Dorsey is bald now. Unrelated to the above points, one question is how resistant Square will be to a business downturn, considering the fears of recession. The relatively low income levels of Square's customer base is one factor for investors to consider if the U.S. economy weakens. But it's fine, moving on. Cash App Growth The Square Cash App helps individuals manage money, buy stocks and cryptocurrency, and more. Block aims to bridge the Cash App and merchant ecosystems with consumer financing services from Afterpay, acquired last year. Its growth has slowed. Further, fintech companies like Afterpay that are ""buy now, pay later,"" or BNPL, face increased regulation. Announced Aug 1 2021, the Afterpay deal was originally valued at $29 billion. With the big drop in Block stock, the deal was valued at less than $15 billion at closing. In the emerging BNPL market where Afterpay competes, the players there are encroaching on credit card networks. Apple (AAPL) has emerged as a rival to Afterpay. Another rival of Afterpay is Affirm Holdings (AFRM). See, I'm left wondering whether Block really needed to buy a company in this sector as opposed to building up its own capabilities or partnering. Competition is heating up in the BNPL market. Another questionable deal: Square acquired a majority stake in Jay-Z's Tidal music streaming service for $297 million in cash and stock. lol? High-fidelity head-scratcher or 4D chess? You tell me. But let's not sleep on the Cash App. It's throwing punches in the peer-to-peer payment rumble, duking it out with Venmo and Zelle. Block brass are talking up a storm about a shiny new investment plan , which will put the company on the road to higher quality earnings under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Little ray of sunshine here: Square holds $5 billion on its balance sheet. Plus, Square stock uses a dual class structure of common stock, which gives insiders more voting power. Moving On In late 2021, Square changed its name to Block, while sticking to the SQ ticker. This whole rebranding is their love letter to blockchain and crypto. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has rallied during the banking crisis. This is mentioned in detail on my COIN post. But Bitcoin is still down significantly from its high near $68,900 in November 2021. Block has aimed to build infrastructure that enables bitcoin-based commerce on its merchant platform. In addition, Square created a new business line to help developers build financial services products focused on Bitcoin. Cash App user growth and monetization will certainly be key to the outlook for SQ stock. Cash App growth soared during the coronavirus pandemic amid government economic stimulus. The bearish view is that Cash App growth will slow as the U.S. economy normalizes. The company retains the Square brand for merchants that use its point-of-sale technology and services. Jack Dorsey is bald. For earnings, I need to remind myself how Paypal reacted. Big green. I'm going to go ahead and grab 11/03 47c at about 1.00 each. I'm hoping to see SQ hit well over 48 tonight. Keep in mind, like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too. Next week we have UBER, DDOG, RIVN, RBLX, AMC, DIS, PLUG and U.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

Also, Square faces growing competition on many fronts. For earnings, it seems like analysts are estimating an adjusted profit of 47 cents, up 12% from a year earlier. Revenue, including Bitcoin transactions, will rise 20% to $4.52 billion, analysts estimate. Gross profit is expected to grow 21% to $1.895 billion. Meanwhile, Square stock has plunged 36% so far in 2023 (lol), even as Nasdaq surged nearly 22%. Merchant Business Pressured Block recently replaced the head of its merchant Square business, Alyssa Henry, with Block founder Jack Dorsey. You know, the guy who founded twitter. He's bald now. In its core businesses, Square stock aims to build a two-sided digital payments ecosystem, with products designed for both merchant sellers and consumer buyers. According to UBS analyst Rayna Kuma, they face slowing growth for its consumer Cash App in 2024, written in a recent note to clients. See, I'm worried about potential weakness in Square's point-of-sale business amid growing competitive pressures from Toast (TOST) in restaurants and Fiserv's (FISV) Clover unit generally. At Wolfe Research, analyst Darrin Peller focused on gross profits in a recent report. Gross margin is how much a company earns from revenue before subtracting operating expenses, taxes and interest. Peller said the Square business needs to expand faster internationally, a move that could improve profitability. Key Details Square and Marqeta (MQ) on Aug. 8 said they have renewed their transaction services agreement for Cash App and Afterpay. In July, Block sued Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) on antitrust grounds, alleging that both credit card networks are overcharging U.S. merchants through high cost interchange and merchant location fees. Jack Dorsey is bald now. Unrelated to the above points, one question is how resistant Square will be to a business downturn, considering the fears of recession. The relatively low income levels of Square's customer base is one factor for investors to consider if the U.S. economy weakens. But it's fine, moving on. Cash App Growth The Square Cash App helps individuals manage money, buy stocks and cryptocurrency, and more. Block aims to bridge the Cash App and merchant ecosystems with consumer financing services from Afterpay, acquired last year. Its growth has slowed. Further, fintech companies like Afterpay that are ""buy now, pay later,"" or BNPL, face increased regulation. Announced Aug 1 2021, the Afterpay deal was originally valued at $29 billion. With the big drop in Block stock, the deal was valued at less than $15 billion at closing. In the emerging BNPL market where Afterpay competes, the players there are encroaching on credit card networks. Apple (AAPL) has emerged as a rival to Afterpay. Another rival of Afterpay is Affirm Holdings (AFRM). See, I'm left wondering whether Block really needed to buy a company in this sector as opposed to building up its own capabilities or partnering. Competition is heating up in the BNPL market. Another questionable deal: Square acquired a majority stake in Jay-Z's Tidal music streaming service for $297 million in cash and stock. lol? High-fidelity head-scratcher or 4D chess? You tell me. But let's not sleep on the Cash App. It's throwing punches in the peer-to-peer payment rumble, duking it out with Venmo and Zelle. Block brass are talking up a storm about a shiny new investment plan , which will put the company on the road to higher quality earnings under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Little ray of sunshine here: Square holds $5 billion on its balance sheet. Plus, Square stock uses a dual class structure of common stock, which gives insiders more voting power. Moving On In late 2021, Square changed its name to Block, while sticking to the SQ ticker. This whole rebranding is their love letter to blockchain and crypto. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has rallied during the banking crisis. This is mentioned in detail on my COIN post. But Bitcoin is still down significantly from its high near $68,900 in November 2021. Block has aimed to build infrastructure that enables bitcoin-based commerce on its merchant platform. In addition, Square created a new business line to help developers build financial services products focused on Bitcoin. Cash App user growth and monetization will certainly be key to the outlook for SQ stock. Cash App growth soared during the coronavirus pandemic amid government economic stimulus. The bearish view is that Cash App growth will slow as the U.S. economy normalizes. The company retains the Square brand for merchants that use its point-of-sale technology and services. Jack Dorsey is bald. For earnings, I need to remind myself how Paypal reacted. Big green. I'm going to go ahead and grab 11/03 47c at about 1.00 each. I'm hoping to see SQ hit well over 48 tonight. Keep in mind, like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play.

Merchant Business Pressured Block recently replaced the head of its merchant Square business, Alyssa Henry, with Block founder Jack Dorsey. You know, the guy who founded twitter. He's bald now. In its core businesses, Square stock aims to build a two-sided digital payments ecosystem, with products designed for both merchant sellers and consumer buyers. According to UBS analyst Rayna Kuma, they face slowing growth for its consumer Cash App in 2024, written in a recent note to clients. See, I'm worried about potential weakness in Square's point-of-sale business amid growing competitive pressures from Toast (TOST) in restaurants and Fiserv's (FISV) Clover unit generally. At Wolfe Research, analyst Darrin Peller focused on gross profits in a recent report. Gross margin is how much a company earns from revenue before subtracting operating expenses, taxes and interest. Peller said the Square business needs to expand faster internationally, a move that could improve profitability. Key Details Square and Marqeta (MQ) on Aug. 8 said they have renewed their transaction services agreement for Cash App and Afterpay. In July, Block sued Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) on antitrust grounds, alleging that both credit card networks are overcharging U.S. merchants through high cost interchange and merchant location fees. Jack Dorsey is bald now. Unrelated to the above points, one question is how resistant Square will be to a business downturn, considering the fears of recession. The relatively low income levels of Square's customer base is one factor for investors to consider if the U.S. economy weakens. But it's fine, moving on. Cash App Growth The Square Cash App helps individuals manage money, buy stocks and cryptocurrency, and more. Block aims to bridge the Cash App and merchant ecosystems with consumer financing services from Afterpay, acquired last year. Its growth has slowed. Further, fintech companies like Afterpay that are ""buy now, pay later,"" or BNPL, face increased regulation. Announced Aug 1 2021, the Afterpay deal was originally valued at $29 billion. With the big drop in Block stock, the deal was valued at less than $15 billion at closing. In the emerging BNPL market where Afterpay competes, the players there are encroaching on credit card networks. Apple (AAPL) has emerged as a rival to Afterpay. Another rival of Afterpay is Affirm Holdings (AFRM). See, I'm left wondering whether Block really needed to buy a company in this sector as opposed to building up its own capabilities or partnering. Competition is heating up in the BNPL market. Another questionable deal: Square acquired a majority stake in Jay-Z's Tidal music streaming service for $297 million in cash and stock. lol? High-fidelity head-scratcher or 4D chess? You tell me. But let's not sleep on the Cash App. It's throwing punches in the peer-to-peer payment rumble, duking it out with Venmo and Zelle. Block brass are talking up a storm about a shiny new investment plan , which will put the company on the road to higher quality earnings under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Little ray of sunshine here: Square holds $5 billion on its balance sheet. Plus, Square stock uses a dual class structure of common stock, which gives insiders more voting power. Moving On In late 2021, Square changed its name to Block, while sticking to the SQ ticker. This whole rebranding is their love letter to blockchain and crypto. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has rallied during the banking crisis. This is mentioned in detail on my COIN post. But Bitcoin is still down significantly from its high near $68,900 in November 2021. Block has aimed to build infrastructure that enables bitcoin-based commerce on its merchant platform. In addition, Square created a new business line to help developers build financial services products focused on Bitcoin. Cash App user growth and monetization will certainly be key to the outlook for SQ stock. Cash App growth soared during the coronavirus pandemic amid government economic stimulus. The bearish view is that Cash App growth will slow as the U.S. economy normalizes. The company retains the Square brand for merchants that use its point-of-sale technology and services. Jack Dorsey is bald. For earnings, I need to remind myself how Paypal reacted. Big green. I'm going to go ahead and grab 11/03 47c at about 1.00 each. I'm hoping to see SQ hit well over 48 tonight.

I think we’ll see consolidation here.I think Stripe will continue its growth through acquisitions edging out the other cloud native providers… and places like GPN and Fiserv will struggle to do the same while losing market share.

For digital payment processor Block, the growth trajectory of Square's consumer Cash App is one issue. There's also cryptocurrency Bitcoin and the Afterpay acquisition. Also, Square faces growing competition on many fronts. For earnings, it seems like analysts are estimating an adjusted profit of 47 cents, up 12% from a year earlier. Revenue, including Bitcoin transactions, will rise 20% to $4.52 billion, analysts estimate. Gross profit is expected to grow 21% to $1.895 billion. Meanwhile, Square stock has plunged 36% so far in 2023 (lol), even as Nasdaq surged nearly 22%. Merchant Business Pressured Block recently replaced the head of its merchant Square business, Alyssa Henry, with Block founder Jack Dorsey. You know, the guy who founded twitter. He's bald now. In its core businesses, Square stock aims to build a two-sided digital payments ecosystem, with products designed for both merchant sellers and consumer buyers. According to UBS analyst Rayna Kuma, they face slowing growth for its consumer Cash App in 2024, written in a recent note to clients. See, I'm worried about potential weakness in Square's point-of-sale business amid growing competitive pressures from Toast (TOST) in restaurants and Fiserv's (FISV) Clover unit generally. At Wolfe Research, analyst Darrin Peller focused on gross profits in a recent report. Gross margin is how much a company earns from revenue before subtracting operating expenses, taxes and interest. Peller said the Square business needs to expand faster internationally, a move that could improve profitability. Key Details Square and Marqeta (MQ) on Aug. 8 said they have renewed their transaction services agreement for Cash App and Afterpay. In July, Block sued Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) on antitrust grounds, alleging that both credit card networks are overcharging U.S. merchants through high cost interchange and merchant location fees. Jack Dorsey is bald now. Unrelated to the above points, one question is how resistant Square will be to a business downturn, considering the fears of recession. The relatively low income levels of Square's customer base is one factor for investors to consider if the U.S. economy weakens. But it's fine, moving on. Cash App Growth The Square Cash App helps individuals manage money, buy stocks and cryptocurrency, and more. Block aims to bridge the Cash App and merchant ecosystems with consumer financing services from Afterpay, acquired last year. Its growth has slowed. Further, fintech companies like Afterpay that are ""buy now, pay later,"" or BNPL, face increased regulation. Announced Aug 1 2021, the Afterpay deal was originally valued at $29 billion. With the big drop in Block stock, the deal was valued at less than $15 billion at closing. In the emerging BNPL market where Afterpay competes, the players there are encroaching on credit card networks. Apple (AAPL) has emerged as a rival to Afterpay. Another rival of Afterpay is Affirm Holdings (AFRM). See, I'm left wondering whether Block really needed to buy a company in this sector as opposed to building up its own capabilities or partnering. Competition is heating up in the BNPL market. Another questionable deal: Square acquired a majority stake in Jay-Z's Tidal music streaming service for $297 million in cash and stock. lol? High-fidelity head-scratcher or 4D chess? You tell me. But let's not sleep on the Cash App. It's throwing punches in the peer-to-peer payment rumble, duking it out with Venmo and Zelle. Block brass are talking up a storm about a shiny new investment plan , which will put the company on the road to higher quality earnings under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Little ray of sunshine here: Square holds $5 billion on its balance sheet. Plus, Square stock uses a dual class structure of common stock, which gives insiders more voting power. Moving On In late 2021, Square changed its name to Block, while sticking to the SQ ticker. This whole rebranding is their love letter to blockchain and crypto. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has rallied during the banking crisis. This is mentioned in detail on my COIN post. But Bitcoin is still down significantly from its high near $68,900 in November 2021. Block has aimed to build infrastructure that enables bitcoin-based commerce on its merchant platform. In addition, Square created a new business line to help developers build financial services products focused on Bitcoin. Cash App user growth and monetization will certainly be key to the outlook for SQ stock. Cash App growth soared during the coronavirus pandemic amid government economic stimulus. The bearish view is that Cash App growth will slow as the U.S. economy normalizes. The company retains the Square brand for merchants that use its point-of-sale technology and services. Jack Dorsey is bald. For earnings, I need to remind myself how Paypal reacted. Big green. I'm going to go ahead and grab 11/03 47c at about 1.00 each. I'm hoping to see SQ hit well over 48 tonight. Keep in mind, like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play.
