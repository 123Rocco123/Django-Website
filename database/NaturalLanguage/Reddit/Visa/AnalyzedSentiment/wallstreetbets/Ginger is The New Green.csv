,"Hello Retards, I'm here to talk to you today about Stripe. https://stripe.com/ What is Stripe you may ask? Stripe is one of the largest private companies backed by Peter Thiel (who has provided us bountiful tendies), Elon Musk, a16z, Thrive, and Sequoia Capital. It is run by 2 Irish brothers, Patrick and John Collison (so we get 2 brains for the price of one). This year, they were ranked #1 on CNBC Disruptor list. (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/stripe-disruptor-50.htmlhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/stripe-disruptor-50.html) So wtf does Stripe do? Good question. Over 50% of all online transactions are processed through Stripe. So think of them like Amex, Visa, and Mastercard mixed with Shopify but without the physical card. 50% was before covid - with a record 9 billion in sales processed this weekend, their online share is probably much, much more. A few months ago they acquired Paystack in Africa - these gingers will soon have a monopoly on the online global money flow on every continent beside China. So how do I buy it? Well, well, here comes in Bill Ackman with $PSTH. He has curated an extraordinary list of long term shareholders perfectly fit to take a 10% stake in Stripe at a 70b valuation. These include: GUGGENHEIM CAPITAL LLC : $499,180,000 - 3.61% - 2nd largest position BAUPOST GROUP LLC : $397,075,000 - 4.29 - 6th largest position SOROBAN CAPITAL PARTNERS LP : $256,964,000 - 2.5% - 14th largest position WELLS FARGO & COMPANY $222,398,0000 - largest new position PRICE T ROWE ASSOCIATES INC $174,318,000 MILLENNIUM MANAGEMENT LLC $119,711,000 CITADEL ADVISORS LLC $49,170,000 And WARREN BUFFETT soon. How do we know it's $PSTH for sure? Well, well, we have been doing some extensive DD. DD so strong and huge and perfectly circumcised like Bill Ackman's dick that after the co-founder started following us last week - the RISK PROGRAM MANAGER started monitoring us.

Stripe is one of the largest private companies backed by Peter Thiel (who has provided us bountiful tendies), Elon Musk, a16z, Thrive, and Sequoia Capital. It is run by 2 Irish brothers, Patrick and John Collison (so we get 2 brains for the price of one). This year, they were ranked #1 on CNBC Disruptor list. (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/stripe-disruptor-50.htmlhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/stripe-disruptor-50.html) So wtf does Stripe do? Good question. Over 50% of all online transactions are processed through Stripe. So think of them like Amex, Visa, and Mastercard mixed with Shopify but without the physical card. 50% was before covid - with a record 9 billion in sales processed this weekend, their online share is probably much, much more. A few months ago they acquired Paystack in Africa - these gingers will soon have a monopoly on the online global money flow on every continent beside China. So how do I buy it? Well, well, here comes in Bill Ackman with $PSTH. He has curated an extraordinary list of long term shareholders perfectly fit to take a 10% stake in Stripe at a 70b valuation.

,"Hello Retards, I'm here to talk to you today about Stripe. https://stripe.com/ What is Stripe you may ask? Stripe is one of the largest private companies backed by Peter Thiel (who has provided us bountiful tendies), Elon Musk, a16z, Thrive, and Sequoia Capital. It is run by 2 Irish brothers, Patrick and John Collison (so we get 2 brains for the price of one). This year, they were ranked #1 on CNBC Disruptor list. (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/stripe-disruptor-50.htmlhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/stripe-disruptor-50.html) So wtf does Stripe do? Good question. Over 50% of all online transactions are processed through Stripe. So think of them like Amex, Visa, and Mastercard mixed with Shopify but without the physical card. 50% was before covid - with a record 9 billion in sales processed this weekend, their online share is probably much, much more. A few months ago they acquired Paystack in Africa - these gingers will soon have a monopoly on the online global money flow on every continent beside China. So how do I buy it? Well, well, here comes in Bill Ackman with $PSTH. He has curated an extraordinary list of long term shareholders perfectly fit to take a 10% stake in Stripe at a 70b valuation. These include: GUGGENHEIM CAPITAL LLC : $499,180,000 - 3.61% - 2nd largest position BAUPOST GROUP LLC : $397,075,000 - 4.29 - 6th largest position SOROBAN CAPITAL PARTNERS LP : $256,964,000 - 2.5% - 14th largest position WELLS FARGO & COMPANY $222,398,0000 - largest new position PRICE T ROWE ASSOCIATES INC $174,318,000 MILLENNIUM MANAGEMENT LLC $119,711,000 CITADEL ADVISORS LLC $49,170,000 And WARREN BUFFETT soon.
