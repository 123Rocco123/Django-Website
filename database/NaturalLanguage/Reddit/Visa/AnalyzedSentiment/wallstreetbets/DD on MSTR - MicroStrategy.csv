What is MSTR’s market cap right now? 6.2bn as of 4/22/2021. If you are bullish on the coin, then MSTR is heavily undervalued. IF the coin jumps to a $70,000 ATH (could be possible within months)... then MSTR’s assets will increase to 6.36 bn. What is their market cap again? That’s right, whenever the coin jumps high then MSTR will surely follow. Essentially, MSTR is a derivative of the coin. But it’s more rewarding to get in on MSTR because the ROI is a lot bigger than the coin. Calls and shares whenever it dips are the play here. If you take a look at the graph of MSTR, you will know what I am talking about, 3 month graph of MSTR from Jan 22- Apr 22 /2021 All these dips and rises. They're by $100-300. If you pick a somewhat floor like $600. And if the bull market for coin continues.. then there is no reason it should not be at $800+ again like the past. Risk: I am not the biggest fan of the coin, however I am a fan of the bull market for it. Big institutions have bought in on this ex: Tesla, JP Morgan, Fidelity, PayPal, Visa, etc... the cat's out of the bag. Is the coin the future tho? Maybe on another discussion, but I doubt it. However, derivatives of the coin (where it falls and rises) I do not doubt. Because the market is overall confusing to me and too many factors are in play for me to consider, MSTR is something that is not. They are a derivative of the coin. Plays: Adding in shares here and there (been burned tho.. so I'm taking it easy with calls). And add in calls for July at the $800-1000 strike. Positions: 2 @ 639.43. Looking to add more shares / acquire a call for either 4/30 or july. Edited: added an additional share. 3 @ 627.10 now.",Hmmm no rocket emojis,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.998

I believe what has happened was that MSTR was being used as a proxy for people that couldn't, or wouldn't, buy said forbidden asset but wanted exposure. MARA/RIOT fall in this category too. Think like pension fund managers or whatever. Now that COIN has ipo'd, COIN is clearly the superior proxy. I wouldn't touch MSTR until whatever money that was using it as a proxy has rotated out, should be clear once the price action starts to mirror forbidden asset once more.",0,0.52,NEGATIVE,1.0

But it’s more rewarding to get in on MSTR because the ROI is a lot bigger than the coin. Calls and shares whenever it dips are the play here. If you take a look at the graph of MSTR, you will know what I am talking about, 3 month graph of MSTR from Jan 22- Apr 22 /2021 All these dips and rises. They're by $100-300. If you pick a somewhat floor like $600. And if the bull market for coin continues.. then there is no reason it should not be at $800+ again like the past. Risk: I am not the biggest fan of the coin, however I am a fan of the bull market for it. Big institutions have bought in on this ex: Tesla, JP Morgan, Fidelity, PayPal, Visa, etc... the cat's out of the bag. Is the coin the future tho? Maybe on another discussion, but I doubt it. However, derivatives of the coin (where it falls and rises) I do not doubt. Because the market is overall confusing to me and too many factors are in play for me to consider, MSTR is something that is not. They are a derivative of the coin. Plays: Adding in shares here and there (been burned tho.. so I'm taking it easy with calls). And add in calls for July at the $800-1000 strike. Positions: 2 @ 639.43. Looking to add more shares / acquire a call for either 4/30 or july. Edited: added an additional share. 3 @ 627.10 now.","As a fellow coin skeptic, it surprises me that you're willing to take this position. I have a DD in my profile detailing why both MSTR and the coin are a house of cards. They are a stagnant company that's barely generating any revenue ($6.5 billion market cap with an EBITDA of $5.92 million in the last quarter. No, really). Which means if coin prices fall below their purchasing average, they won't be able to repay their debts.When I wrote the DD back in early March, there were $36.4 billion in magical pretend USD propping up the coin markets. Now there are $49.2 billion. It's all pretend money pulled out of thin air propping up prices, and sooner or later it's going to come crashing down, taking MSTR with it. The company holds so many coins now, I doubt they can even liquidate their position without tanking prices further.",0,0.545,NEGATIVE,1.0
