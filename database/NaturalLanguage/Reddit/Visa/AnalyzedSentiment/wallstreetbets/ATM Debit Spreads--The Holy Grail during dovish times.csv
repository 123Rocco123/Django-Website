,"Does anyone do ATM debit spreads for something fairly consistent like SQ? 30-45 DTE spreads seem like a solid way to get somewhere between 50-100% returns pretty consistently as long as it goes up like 1% a month (which besides March of this year SQ almost always does). Buy a 225C and sell a 230C for 1/29 (~30DTE) Vertical spreads negate the effect of theta decay (since you're selling an OTM call) and you don't have to do much besides close the spread the week of expiration. My plan is to close something that has lost 50% value and then just open another spread 6 weeks later. The same for 2/5 (~40DTE) Obviously there are pitfalls, but has anyone been trading ATM spreads for a while?

Another one Yes, stonks might go down every once in a while, but if things are going to stay dovish (and the last decade shows the US likes to keep it that way), why wouldn't this be the best strategy?

Right now, I'd totally do this on AAPL and AMZN for the earnings run-up. You get to scratch the itch of doing options with better risk management.My strategy is to look for expiries 2 months out, find a spread trading at 60% or less of potential max value (so $3 or less for a $5 spread) and then close out when it gets to about 80% of max value.The only downsides are that there's no thrill of seeing your options explode in value even when the stock has a good run-up and you can hit max loss if there's a big dip.",0,0.533,POSITIVE,0.999

You've got a blue chip like stock growing like it's a startup, and crushing high expectations, and still raising guidance.Whenever it dipped below 3100, and hopefully near 3000, I'd open up a 50 point call spread ATM, or better, ITM.
