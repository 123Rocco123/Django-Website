,"Let me preface this by saying that I know I will get flamed for this by some of you. I don't care. I am speculating based on what I know of my own culture, its history, and old stories that pretty much every single Chinese person on the planet knows (unless you are a total ABC 香蕉, RIP your culture). There are three (maybe four) major periods of Chinese history that have influenced the rest of Chinese warfare, economics, and politics throughout the rest of Chinese history. They are: The warring states period, the Chu-Han contention, the three kingdoms era, and the early Tang dynasty (sort of). The point of going back to the strategies and theories of those era isn't to be totally derivative and mindlessly copy what was used before, but instead to understand human psychology, logistics, and deception to overcome obstacles and if it is your goal, to defeat an opponent. Even in the wars between the ROC and PRC, there were generals who carried around a copy of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms to read and think about strategy and tactics. There was a strategy used several times in the three kingdoms era called the battered body tactic. Most famously. by publicly beating his own general half to death, a warlord won the most crucial battle of the three kingdoms era when he used that general as a double agent for the decisive strike. An equivalent would be if the Argives defecated on the Trojan horse just to make sure the Trojans knew that they didn't want the horse anymore. Right now, that opponent is the US. Tensions are at an all time high. From the trade war to the politicizing of the markets to the extradition case of Meng Wanzhou (an extremely important situation because it is not only political and economic, but also very personal for Xi), the US government has been taking a very aggressive stance towards China. China, meanwhile, is starting to take a historically aggressive stance back. Both sides are using economic policy as an extension of geopolitics for both offense and defence. In the last meeting with US diplomats, they actually had demands to release Meng Wanzhou, undo the obstacles for Chinese students to get Visas, among other things. This is in stark contrast to the more deferential stances of the past. Why did China release the education sector rumors at almost the exact same time as the meeting and put forth rumors of Chinese stock delistings in the US? And then why the bad news after bad news after bad news? Well, the market is forward looking, so once rumors happen again and again, the market treats it as if it already has happened. A lot of institutions have been dumping Chinese stocks. China actually stands to lose a lot by decoupling. They don't want it even more than we don't want it. They are just derisking so that the US doesn't have any avenue to hurt it through the markets like it did when Trump first delisted Chinese companies. By striking first, they are also forcing the US institutions to derisk and sell at a loss, allowing them more leverage in this game of chicken that is going to now be our generation's version ""cold war"" (but very different from the last). But China cannot keep their markets down forever and they will eventually run out of bullets. I expect that once they run out of things they wanted to regulate anyways (no more bad news they had in their back pocket), and also once Meng Wanzhou is released, we might see institutional capital go back into the market. Then, Chinese stocks will recover beautifully and investors will forget everything, just like they did the last time China did their crackdown-a-thon. I know they have at least one bullet left, which is the ""unprecedented"" DIDI penalties. I'm holding on to my BABA and BIDU LEAPs.

Even in the wars between the ROC and PRC, there were generals who carried around a copy of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms to read and think about strategy and tactics.

Tensions are at an all time high. From the trade war to the politicizing of the markets to the extradition case of Meng Wanzhou (an extremely important situation because it is not only political and economic, but also very personal for Xi), the US government has been taking a very aggressive stance towards China. China, meanwhile, is starting to take a historically aggressive stance back. Both sides are using economic policy as an extension of geopolitics for both offense and defence. In the last meeting with US diplomats, they actually had demands to release Meng Wanzhou, undo the obstacles for Chinese students to get Visas, among other things. This is in stark contrast to the more deferential stances of the past. Why did China release the education sector rumors at almost the exact same time as the meeting and put forth rumors of Chinese stock delistings in the US? And then why the bad news after bad news after bad news? Well, the market is forward looking, so once rumors happen again and again, the market treats it as if it already has happened. A lot of institutions have been dumping Chinese stocks. China actually stands to lose a lot by decoupling. They don't want it even more than we don't want it. They are just derisking so that the US doesn't have any avenue to hurt it through the markets like it did when Trump first delisted Chinese companies. By striking first, they are also forcing the US institutions to derisk and sell at a loss, allowing them more leverage in this game of chicken that is going to now be our generation's version ""cold war"" (but very different from the last). But China cannot keep their markets down forever and they will eventually run out of bullets. I expect that once they run out of things they wanted to regulate anyways (no more bad news they had in their back pocket), and also once Meng Wanzhou is released, we might see institutional capital go back into the market.

As long as they can bleed without dying, they will bleed to enforce their ideology. Which is why I believe the move to force edutech sector to go non-profit happened too.Having both fintech and edutech bloating at the same time would cause serious issues in the future if they ever want to control it so it's better to suffer a bit now than to be crippled later.TLDR: Edutech most likely would never recover from its non-profit status because it goes against ccp's ideology that teaching is supposed to be sacred and noble and fintech will recover when the culling is over but wouldn't reach its peak anytime soon.",0,0.518,NEGATIVE,1.0
