Positions: US Steel call debit spread,","Folks, it is not hard to figure out where this market is headed. The Fed is going to begin unloading their balance sheets. That means the money tap is fixing to be turned off. Furthermore, interest rates rising impacts EVERYONE, not just corporations. Loans are more expensive across the board. Coupled with inflation, it's a giant lead weight tied to the entire market. People are going to be spending a lot less money & higher interest eats into earnings. Add that to the fact that stocks are still extremely inflated post COVID. Zoom out on almost any major blue chip chart & you can see that we are in a giant bubble.The Fed is also not providing any concrete schedule. This adds a lot of uncertainty to the market. Furthermore, asset management firms are advising clients sell the surges & not buy the dips. Which explains why every pop we have had lately is immediately sold off.Also, today's GDP report contained some warning signs. Mainly that most of the growth came from companies stocking up on inventory instead of people buying things. We also cannot forget that everyone received stimulus checks last year. Those checks are not coming anymore. Thus, they are not being inserted into the economy.Another giant problem is incoming monetary tightening is not like prior years. During those years, the fed began tightening when inflation was near the desired level of 2%. It was preemptive & designed to keep inflation from increasing versus pushing it down. Meaning the Fed had a lot more latitude in how & when to raise rates & respond to changing dynamics. This means they are going to have to raise rates & taper REGARDLESS of the economic data.",0,0.53,NEGATIVE,1.0
