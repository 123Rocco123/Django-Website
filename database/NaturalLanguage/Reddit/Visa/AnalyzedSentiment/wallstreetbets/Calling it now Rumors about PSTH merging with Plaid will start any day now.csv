,"Hey degenerates, while I haven't posted here for some time, I haven't stopped lurking in this cozy little autism-den we call home. So suffice to say I have noticed the obsession this sub has developed for PSTH and come with information on what I believe is gonna quickly become Ackman's #1 target: Plaid. Why had Plaid never come up as a target before? Well, up until a couple of hours ago, Visa had an agreement to buy plaid for about $5b. The DOJ was trying to stop this merger and, low and behold, they won and the agreement was terminated. Okay cool, but why plaid? Plaid checks all of Ackman's boxes. Unicorn- check. Fintech- check. Huge growth- check. High barrier to entry and strong competitive position- check. Oh also, Ackman hates that he missed out on buying a piece of Visa in the past so what better way to fill that hole than with Visa's sloppy seconds? Tbh, I'm too busy to write out the dozens of reasons why this is the perfect target but it's pretty obvious once one looks into Plaid and Ackman's criteria. The only reason why no articles have been written speculating such is because the merger was only terminated a couple of hours ago.
