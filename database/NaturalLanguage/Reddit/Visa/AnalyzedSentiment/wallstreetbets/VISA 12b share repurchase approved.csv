Sure there was some correction in July 2021, but that came after a massive bull run starting after the 2020 crash.In the short term, there will be some chatter, as news (economic uncertainty, covid variants, travel impacts, etc) has negative or positive effects on share price.But card payment transactions aren’t going away anytime soon, and will continue to grow in the mid term. That’s why I have LEAP and shares.So the drop over losing Amazon UK? Marginal in comparison to the size of visa’s bottom line. That’s all brexit shenanigans, Amazon is flexing over the change in allowable transactions fee rate cap, which Mastercard also took advantage of.Visa hasn’t been this low since the beginning of the year, it was a good buy then and it’s a good buy now.We are talking about the most dominant card brands. 80+ million vendors, over 200 countries / territories. And there’s still room to grow, both in their existing share of the market (I think they sit at 40-50%) and the fact that the addressable market is increasing (digital transactions are increasing, cash acceptance is decreasing)",1,0.541,NEGATIVE,0.938
