,"SEC extends deadline to provide certain disclosures, such as earnings, by 45 days, so MarketWatch asked all 30 Dow components their plans. The Securities and Exchange Commission will allow companies to delay reporting earnings, if needed, but that doesn't mean any of them will. The SEC said last week that it would extend the deadline for companies to provide certain disclosure reports by 45 days, given business disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
