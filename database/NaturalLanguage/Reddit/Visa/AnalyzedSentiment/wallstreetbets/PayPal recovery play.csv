If we assume longer term growth or higher growth the number changes significantly. If they can maintain the growth for at least 10 years at 11% FV is around $85. A 15% growth rate which is the average of the last 3 years would be $115. A 20% growth rate like this year would be $170. We're talking about averages here over time so if we for example have a stronger economic recovery when rates are lowered or similar the picture changes again to higher base earnings. In my opinion the valuation is very very conservative currently. These are also current prices so next year they also should naturally go up.We're on the very low end of the valuation spectrum any lower and a long term below 10% growth would be priced into the stock.,0,0.578,POSITIVE,0.739
