,"Paypal recently announced that in 4Q they are going to enter the Chinese market, I expect this to be a major failure for a couple of reasons.. China is not a 'friendly business environment', there are no anti-competitive laws or judges and juries that are not bought up by the PRC. I'm guessing Paypal is betting on the fact that they can distrupt the absolute gigantic market share of WePay. (lol. its basically installed on every chinese persons phone). Thing is, Tencent is the PRC's golden duck, it allows them to conduct massive surveillance, and all the board of directors will bend over for anything the PRC wants. Why would they want to help out Paypal? WePay/WeChat is not just a payment app. It is everything. It's google, facebook, craiglist, your 401k, dating app, facetime, chat, .. the list goes on. Theres a reason that this has gigantic market share, you can do everything on it, including paying off loans, clearly they the better service + they are a staple of current chinese culture. Paypal has its own problems not even considering China. Square, FB, Visa and Mastercard, banks, samsung, fucking cryptocurrencies - the payment space is SUPER competitive. Paypal has lost its edge. every tech company on the NASDAQ has a payment service now, what has happened to Paypal is what most bears get hard about when considering Netflix. Theres a reason Thiel and Musk left the company years ago, its not an innovative company anymore-- this China bullshit ""B-But what about the 2.5 Billion Chinese??"" is just an attempt by this shit company to pump up their stock before it goes bankrupt. Side question: who the fuck even uses Paypal? im not from the States but ive never had an account or used it, here we just use interac transfers to send money. Most likely this is a longer-term short with puts after the 4Q (when their BS China deal goes through) into 2020, until then it will probably be pumped higher.",This is not fucking DD you fucking moron,0,0.506,0.981,NEGATIVE
