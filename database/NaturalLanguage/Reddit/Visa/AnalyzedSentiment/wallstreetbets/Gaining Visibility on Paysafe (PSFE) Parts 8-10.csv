,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future. Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of “look at the chart” and “price is truth.” This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth. No, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, “The stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.” Do with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own. Given how much disinformation has been out there, I thought I’d do my bit to peel back the layers on what I consider to be a reliable long term investment.

,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future. Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of “look at the chart” and “price is truth.” This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth. No, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, “The stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.” Do with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own. Given how much disinformation has been out there, I thought I’d do my bit to peel back the layers on what I consider to be a reliable long term investment.

,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future. Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of “look at the chart” and “price is truth.” This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth. No, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, “The stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.” Do with this what you will. These are simply observations.

,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future.

,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions.

Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions.

,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions.

PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future. Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of “look at the chart” and “price is truth.” This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth. No, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, “The stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.” Do with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own. Given how much disinformation has been out there, I thought I’d do my bit to peel back the layers on what I consider to be a reliable long term investment. This concludes our public service announcement. We now return to normal programming.","Agreed, this article by Abagail Fisher (does she even exist) waxes poetic about all of the hedge fund buying since June.

,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40.

Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future. Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of “look at the chart” and “price is truth.” This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth. No, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, “The stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.” Do with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own. Given how much disinformation has been out there, I thought I’d do my bit to peel back the layers on what I consider to be a reliable long term investment.

,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b).

PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future. Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of “look at the chart” and “price is truth.” This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth. No, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, “The stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ...

,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b).

If you are checking price daily, you may have missed the point of the DD, which is to not worry about the short term. I see this is as a long term hold, not a predictable catalyst play at all. Q3 is an expected miss, and some people may only be digesting this now. If you need to see regular price accretion, there are probably better stocks out there.",1,0.536,NEGATIVE,0.893

Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future. Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of “look at the chart” and “price is truth.” This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth.

,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80.

Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future. Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of “look at the chart” and “price is truth.” This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth. No, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, “The stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.” Do with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own.

,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth.

Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future.

,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth.

That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future. Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of “look at the chart” and “price is truth.” This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth. No, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, “The stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.” Do with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own.

,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue.

Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future. Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of “look at the chart” and “price is truth.” This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth. No, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, “The stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.” Do with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own.

,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA.

Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future. Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of “look at the chart” and “price is truth.” This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth. No, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, “The stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.” Do with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own.

,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA.

If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future. Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of “look at the chart” and “price is truth.” This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth. No, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, “The stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.” Do with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own. Given how much disinformation has been out there, I thought I’d do my bit to peel back the layers on what I consider to be a reliable long term investment.

,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market.

It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future. Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of “look at the chart” and “price is truth.” This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth. No, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, “The stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.” Do with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own. Given how much disinformation has been out there, I thought I’d do my bit to peel back the layers on what I consider to be a reliable long term investment. This concludes our public service announcement. We now return to normal programming.",I hope that it stays below $10 so that i can stock up next week im looking to have 100 shares before it gets too $15 which shouldnt be too hard i also hold some sofi and lcid but i think paysafe shouldnt be something i miss out on,0,0.55,NEGATIVE,0.73
,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run.

Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future.

,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER.

To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future. Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of “look at the chart” and “price is truth.” This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth. No, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, “The stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.” Do with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own.

,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt.

Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future.

No, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, “The stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.” Do with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own.

,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that.

Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future.

,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10.

From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future. Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of “look at the chart” and “price is truth.” This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth. No, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, “The stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.” Do with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own. Given how much disinformation has been out there, I thought I’d do my bit to peel back the layers on what I consider to be a reliable long term investment. This concludes our public service announcement. We now return to normal programming.","I hear you.

,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10.

Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future. Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of “look at the chart” and “price is truth.” This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth. No, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, “The stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.” Do with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own. Given how much disinformation has been out there, I thought I’d do my bit to peel back the layers on what I consider to be a reliable long term investment. This concludes our public service announcement. We now return to normal programming.",If I’m not mistaken that drop in take rate was influenced by their direct marketing exits which are expected to be out of the mix this quarter (Q4) We may not see a clean ER until then. Of course the Q4 balance sheet may also be affected by the SafetyPay acquisition.,3,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.993
,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9.

The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future. Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of “look at the chart” and “price is truth.” This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth. No, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, “The stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.” Do with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own. Given how much disinformation has been out there, I thought I’d do my bit to peel back the layers on what I consider to be a reliable long term investment. This concludes our public service announcement. We now return to normal programming.","With all this activity and growth, why has their revenue been so flat?",0,0.571,NEGATIVE,0.988
,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 8. Management As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments. This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook. Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of positive news, the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story. It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value. Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers. Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of Visa, Coinbase, Fubo Gaming, FOXbet, Golden Nugget, Bankable, Wix, Repay, WynnBet, Betfred USA, OwnersBox, Dutch neobank bunq, IntelliPay, Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, Smart Property Systems, Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, Montana Lottery, PlayUP, SuperBook Sports and Bitrise. In that same period, they’ve also: expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to 48 states, expanded their digital wallets to trade 38 [digital]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies launched online cash payments on Microsoft’s Xbox in 22 countries struck deals with Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition, launched a new global travel safeguarding model, a unique innovation that quickly led to a new deal with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. Also during this time, they announced the appointments of: Digital wallet division CEO, Chirag Patel (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander) North American iGaming CEO, Zak Cutler (fmr DraftKings exec), Boardmember Mark Brooker (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill) All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s newly opened sports betting market). As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value.

As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.” They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America. Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value. Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers. The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley said, “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.” In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies. Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun & Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.” Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “ Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it. 9. Lockup Expiration Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares (20F p. 135). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold. Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10. From their proxy statement (SEC filing-DEFM14A): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.” 10. Valuation Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts. By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples. Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures. But Paysafe is anything but that. Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt. Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to Reuters. To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars. Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a Credit Suisse analyst offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER. Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA). Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick. Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new. It’s not like the market is unaware of analyst conflicts of interest or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on Archegos, $5.3B fine for mortgage backed securities,$2.5B fine after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent $547M fine after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market. If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades. Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run. True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear. Until then, here are a few reference points: Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company: The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that. Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue. Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62. Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business. Brick & Mortar Payment Processing Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth. Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick & mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison. For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X. This would put PSFE at $41.80. Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison: As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS. By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.” Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ($5.6b to $21.5b). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ($169m to $1.43b). Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted. Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin). There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution: PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10 PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90 PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40. PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75 PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41 Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31 When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly. Sector multiples: Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a ~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group. After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67 EV/Rev ratio : $40.17 EV/FCF ratio : $39.72 Average : $41.84 It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all. Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future. Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of “look at the chart” and “price is truth.” This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth. No, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, “The stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.” Do with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own. Given how much disinformation has been out there, I thought I’d do my bit to peel back the layers on what I consider to be a reliable long term investment. This concludes our public service announcement. We now return to normal programming.",Paysafe is a fabulous company. Bill foley is a great investor with a long track record,0,0.597,POSITIVE,0.997
