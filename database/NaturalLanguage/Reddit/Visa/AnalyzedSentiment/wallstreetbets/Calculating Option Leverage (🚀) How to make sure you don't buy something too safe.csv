,"Maybe a lot of people use strategies that don't really care about how leveraged their options are, but I personally always like to know. When you walk through them and see that one is x6 leverage (🚀) and one is x35 (🚀🚀🚀🚀) it opens your eyes and makes you think a bit more carefully about what you're doing so you don't accidentally do something too safe. I like to follow the philosophy that if you can't teach something you don't understand it well enough so I made this into a video that explains this entirely using PowerPoint icons, which is linked at the bottom. I'm going to explain everything here though because I know clicking a link is a lot of work. When I did this math Visa was trading at $243.17 per share. Visa might not be a classic around here but look at that 5 year graph, you literally can't lose. You can buy a call (🚀) with a strike price of 240 that expires September 17th for $853. This call has a delta of about 0.59. I'm assuming the people here at least know that delta exists and where to find it. This means that this option currently moves up and down with the “power” of 59 shares. If this option moves deeper in the money this number will increase. If this option moves out of the money this number will decrease. Knowing that this option moves as if it were 59 shares is the key to finding its leverage (🚀🚀🚀). 59 shares at Visa’s current price would cost $14,347 but you only need to pay $853 for this contract, what a deal, which has the same ability to make or lose money. So with $14,347 you could buy 16 of these contracts (🚀) which means this contract has about 16 times leverage (🚀🚀🚀🚀). You can calculate this exactly by dividing $14,347 by 853 to get the amount of leverage at that moment, which is 16.82. So, every dollar you put into these Visa calls is going to gain or lose almost 17 times more than if you just bought shares. A 2 year call on AAPL could be as conservative as 2x leverage and a daily UPRO call could have 100x (🚀🚀🚀🚀). Know what you're getting yourself into before you throw your money into something like x2 leverage. For the big brains out there, this is a minor greek called lambda. 🚀🚀🚀🚀 TLDR: Option Leverage = (Delta * Share Price) / Option Price 🚀🚀🚀🚀 Example: Visa 240c 9/17 = (59 * 243.17) / 853 = 16.82 Video version: https://youtu.be/FiWGJd16Kss",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

I'm going to explain everything here though because I know clicking a link is a lot of work. When I did this math Visa was trading at $243.17 per share. Visa might not be a classic around here but look at that 5 year graph, you literally can't lose. You can buy a call (🚀) with a strike price of 240 that expires September 17th for $853. This call has a delta of about 0.59. I'm assuming the people here at least know that delta exists and where to find it. This means that this option currently moves up and down with the “power” of 59 shares. If this option moves deeper in the money this number will increase. If this option moves out of the money this number will decrease. Knowing that this option moves as if it were 59 shares is the key to finding its leverage (🚀🚀🚀). 59 shares at Visa’s current price would cost $14,347 but you only need to pay $853 for this contract, what a deal, which has the same ability to make or lose money. So with $14,347 you could buy 16 of these contracts (🚀) which means this contract has about 16 times leverage (🚀🚀🚀🚀). You can calculate this exactly by dividing $14,347 by 853 to get the amount of leverage at that moment, which is 16.82. So, every dollar you put into these Visa calls is going to gain or lose almost 17 times more than if you just bought shares.

Visa might not be a classic around here but look at that 5 year graph, you literally can't lose. You can buy a call (🚀) with a strike price of 240 that expires September 17th for $853. This call has a delta of about 0.59. I'm assuming the people here at least know that delta exists and where to find it. This means that this option currently moves up and down with the “power” of 59 shares. If this option moves deeper in the money this number will increase. If this option moves out of the money this number will decrease. Knowing that this option moves as if it were 59 shares is the key to finding its leverage (🚀🚀🚀). 59 shares at Visa’s current price would cost $14,347 but you only need to pay $853 for this contract, what a deal, which has the same ability to make or lose money. So with $14,347 you could buy 16 of these contracts (🚀) which means this contract has about 16 times leverage (🚀🚀🚀🚀). You can calculate this exactly by dividing $14,347 by 853 to get the amount of leverage at that moment, which is 16.82. So, every dollar you put into these Visa calls is going to gain or lose almost 17 times more than if you just bought shares.

This call has a delta of about 0.59. I'm assuming the people here at least know that delta exists and where to find it. This means that this option currently moves up and down with the “power” of 59 shares. If this option moves deeper in the money this number will increase. If this option moves out of the money this number will decrease. Knowing that this option moves as if it were 59 shares is the key to finding its leverage (🚀🚀🚀). 59 shares at Visa’s current price would cost $14,347 but you only need to pay $853 for this contract, what a deal, which has the same ability to make or lose money. So with $14,347 you could buy 16 of these contracts (🚀) which means this contract has about 16 times leverage (🚀🚀🚀🚀). You can calculate this exactly by dividing $14,347 by 853 to get the amount of leverage at that moment, which is 16.82. So, every dollar you put into these Visa calls is going to gain or lose almost 17 times more than if you just bought shares.

I'm going to explain everything here though because I know clicking a link is a lot of work. When I did this math Visa was trading at $243.17 per share. Visa might not be a classic around here but look at that 5 year graph, you literally can't lose. You can buy a call (🚀) with a strike price of 240 that expires September 17th for $853. This call has a delta of about 0.59. I'm assuming the people here at least know that delta exists and where to find it. This means that this option currently moves up and down with the “power” of 59 shares. If this option moves deeper in the money this number will increase. If this option moves out of the money this number will decrease. Knowing that this option moves as if it were 59 shares is the key to finding its leverage (🚀🚀🚀). 59 shares at Visa’s current price would cost $14,347 but you only need to pay $853 for this contract, what a deal, which has the same ability to make or lose money. So with $14,347 you could buy 16 of these contracts (🚀) which means this contract has about 16 times leverage (🚀🚀🚀🚀). You can calculate this exactly by dividing $14,347 by 853 to get the amount of leverage at that moment, which is 16.82. So, every dollar you put into these Visa calls is going to gain or lose almost 17 times more than if you just bought shares. A 2 year call on AAPL could be as conservative as 2x leverage and a daily UPRO call could have 100x (🚀🚀🚀🚀).
