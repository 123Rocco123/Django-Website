This is what I hate about this stock: There's an existential threat of fake assets flaming out like in 2017, even though this seems less likely with each passing day as more and more institutions hold internet money on their balance sheets and incorporate it into their remittance / payments infrastructure It's weird that Sat-oshi is unknown and still holds $35B of the core asset, making him the greatest hero but also the greatest threat if he/she/they/zir were to dump So it's not necessarily a slam dunk but I'm betting fake assets continue to evolve from meme dog coins to real utility providers in the DeFi ecosystem. Also, this an ancillary business to the trading / brokerage side of the house: which is displacing business from Fidelity, Charles Schwab, CBOE, stock exchanges, etc. as people go digital.

USDC is created by coinbase and so if coinbase goes down, so will the USDC. Now, I don't think that coinbase is going anywhere (especially now that they are public), but why would I stake a large chunk of my savings with USDC through coinbase if there is existential risk there? I'd rather just buy the stock. Staking USDC is a bet coinbase doesn't go under. Buying coinbase stock is a bet coinbase does well. Not exactly the same, but similar; whereas buying $COIN will most likely produce bigger returns then staking USDC.I do agree with everything else though.
