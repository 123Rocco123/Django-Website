,"Respected Traders and Investors, Sobbing and crying :_( I’m sorry guys. I think I let you all down. This understanding of the stock market that i had in my head that fundamental analysis is nothing compared to technical analysis and i could just cut all the background noise by just simply looking at the charts. I thought, why in the world should I crunch numbers that these Wall Street HFs and institutions try to do. I’m so better than this. So I keep going to bars and having drinks, partying all night, using tinder, etc, thinking when an exit liquidity rally to ATH comes about in July-August 2022, I will short the entire market. And soon Wall Street will remember me as the only guy who saw it all coming to the perfect date. So I created this illusion in my head that in Q4 2022 we will 10000% get our recession because the liquidity in the market was starting to decrease. So I told literally every huge player on Wall Street about this macro idea. I also try to impose my thoughts on each one of you that in Q4 we will have a recession. But I got so deluded into my illusionary world that I never tried to calculate could we be early to a recession even before Q4. Now, it turns out, we could. 2Q of -ve GDP could come by July. Its a 50% chance though. Meaning if it happens i ain't gonna get the glory for this crisis. Jeremy Grantham and Michael Burry are. So im gonna piss off in the corner writing this post. Lets quickly recap how it all unfolded this week, but before we do that lets look at the prediction we did beforehand for the most crazy week in my last post. Earnings went horrible, hence Case 2 is being followed. Earnings season : As we all know this week, earnings were going to be the most important one going forward for Q2 because 5/6 megacaps carried $8T in S&P500. We also had GDP no coming out on Thursday, as we discussed in my last post. Lets see how it all went. Tech Earnings Season April 25 ( Monday ) : Coco-cola Analysis Monday was pretty brutal for Asian Markets because China was further going into lockdown. We also had a palm oil ban on exports. But in the USA something happened. DXY went up, but the bonds yields went down, meaning people were buying USA bonds for safe havens or maybe dumping Chinese bonds for the USA. KO Earnings When Cocola earnings came out they beat est. because they had raised prices of their drinks and were kinda flaunting corporate greed on the balance sheet, or some might argue, they were just preparing themselves for recession or stagflation. So the stock rallied monetarily for the day and had a positive effect on the stock market. KO T.A. As for technicals, you can clearly see in the 1hr chart the stocks had what you call ""Bearish divergence"" and then the stock went down to test lower levels later on in the week when everything was getting hammered. If the candles start closing below the white line then the buy zone for dip buying would be the green lines, which are close to 1.618. April 26 ( Tuesday ) : Microsoft and Alphabhet ( Good cop bad cop ) Boi oh boi this day will be remembered by many people in the upcoming months. MSFT Earnings Microsoft kickstarted the show with a beating est. Hence stock rallied. They too had earnings quite similar to Coke.. MSFT T.A. As for technicals, well, the earnings were great so im not expecting a 1.618 but just 1 fib guarantees for the ABC correction wave. GOOGL Earnings Bot now came the google earnings in after hours. Markets had gone up because of Microsoft. Everyone got confident, well Google is the most profitable business on the planet. Surely they wont miss anything. But revenue and net income came below exp. Youtube got hit badly by advertising. Maybe people are going out more often and don't watch YouTube that much more as was the case in the pandemic. Also, finance YouTubers are doing horribly badly. But the company announced a dividend in the form of a share buyback of $70B, but the market was still not happy. The stock dropped -5% in post market hours. But visa earnings came quite well, so the market was gonna be in a jolly mood the next day because transactional revenue was growing, meaning people were buying the dips. GOOGL T.A. As for technicals, the 1.618 in the ABC correction wave is coming 100%. The price action looks so weak that im not even bothering to use divergences. Just keep buying this stock at support levels. April 27 ( Wednesday ) : Meta Paypal Pinterest Qualcomm ( Pack of 4 ) Oh these guys, im not gonna bother with their charts or balance sheet because everything was pretty simple in their balance sheet and T.A. Well Meta is kinda based on the principles of Netflix. Only subscribers matter. So daily users increased, but monthly users didn't. EPS went up, and also the stock was already beaten that badly it had no choice but to go up. Paypal kinda had earnings like Visa. Transactional revenue was growing. Pins as Meta was beaten up bad. It beat estimates, monthly users declined, but it went up because revenue per user increased. Qualcomm, I have no idea. April 28 ( Thursday ) : Amazon and Apple AMZN Earnings AAPL Earnings Thursday was all about Apple and Amazon. Everyone knew before that Amazon would miss earnings because of the Rivian thing and Apple sales were gonna be strong. So what happened? No one expected Amazon's earnings to come in this horribly. Now reports are coming in that everyone hates Bezos XD. Also, Apple did an outlook thing for Q2 that they will get hit badly because of chips supply chains. Since Q1 earnings are already priced, what better way for Q2 than by shorting the company as directed by Tim. AMZN T.A. AAPL T.A. As for Amazon technicals, surely by know you might have heard of the wyckoff distribution and accumulation. Green box should hold accumulation else it could turn out to be redistribution. For Apple, well, in short $138-139 support is coming 100%. April 29 ( Friday ) : Judgement Day Think of it as the day when the court gives its final verdict. Well, the stock market gave one hell of it to investors in a single day. April turned out to be the worst month for markets since 2008's October GFC. S&P500 had its worst four month since 1939 Great depression and Nasdaq since 1970. To everyone's surprise, but hey, not us, we got that -ve GDP print. And by Q4 2022, we will certainly get our recession. Things are only going to get much worse from here. So why am I saying this. Can't we all just simply short the market and make insane amounts of money in the way down. Turns out it ain't easy as it seems. Now you have got to be dealing with what we call turbulence in the market. We may go up and down, go up and down. Meaning options are pretty much useless in the market. The only choice you have got is swing trading in futures or the normal market. So find a favorite youtuber who predicted all the things in the market like Recession, bond drought, commodity shock, stock market crash etc. And if you cant find the guy then how about reading my piece below and heck even sharing with your friends about how this guy was so close to figuring it all out but he was just too damn lazy for wallstreet fast life. ( Don't try to give me a job in Dms unless you're a Warren Buffet. I love flying solo and cleaning the toilets at Black Rock. Yes, i love my job. ) So now we shall discuss the three questions that need answering : Q1 : How much is J powell gonna raise rates. So my readers know how I dont just give out my secrets that easily. I need you all to work too, and come to your own conclusions. So in my last post I gave you all the homework that what was the third observation in the chart below. Homework Chart : Yellow lines : Wage inflation , Red line : CPI inflation , White : FED rate hike The answer to that question is FED has to raise rates at least the half of what CPI annualized inflation is, or almost equal to it. Although some might argue the ""Taylor rule"" states, that its actually double, but seriously, my charts don't lie to me. So now you all must be wondering okay, so half of say like 8% is 4%. What's the big fuss about. Turns out technically your 4% is gonna go to a maximum of 8% due to IHS and trend lines breaks. So idk, what fundamental analysis or news comes around will led to such technicals. But the chart is telling me that the 10yr bonds are going to 6 to 8% by 2023, but the terminal rates are still projecting 3.2% by Aug 23. We have got room considering the labor market is robust and strong. Hypothesis 1 : Terminal rates projection will go to 6% by Aug 2023. Here’s the calculation on how it could. 50X6 = 3% + 0.25 = 3.25% by eoy. 5 X 0.50 = 2.5% Total = 5.75% So what impact will it have ? Almost certainly you're gonna get recession coz you will be raising rates in a contracting economy. At the end of large cycles we have Recession Hypothesis 2 : FED-U turns and doesn't raise rates over 2% Welcome to Japan, where you keep your bond yields down, inflate the dollar by printing even more and send all your assets to the moon. Note : ""Million Dollar Advise"" Lets also look at a GDP chart over here which only the few selected people on Wall Street know about. GDP negative print vs Stock Market crash This chart tells us well the first negative print is priced in the market. Question now remains whether the next GDP no’s are going to be positive or negative. - If we are going to get positive no’s by July then the stock market should go up in Q2. - if we are gonna get that 2nd negative print and complete the definition of 2Q of negative GDP growth, you're talking about -50% in Q2 itself. So you have got a lot of number crunching to do with big banks and institutions reading my post. Retailers don't try it. Just keep buying the dip with cash i told you to accumulate. Don't rush in coz, buying stocks, this year is going to be like buying groceries. Or you can just place your first two orders at -30% & -40% and cancel the noise. Q2 : How much will Bond get destroyed We have talked about this in “ Credit risk america “ post that bonds are to be bought b/w May 16- June 16. At least that's what historical technicals in TLT are telling me, which is an iShare 20yr ETF. As for 10yr bonds idk guys. This bond is tricky. It follows the terminal rate which is currently 3.2%. My calculation says 6%. So more sell-off, I guess. Terminal Rate Remember : iShare is historical pattern and 10yr bonds is current T.A. pattern. One of them will be right. Its either gonna be buying bonds buying at may 15-june 15 or buying bonds at 6 or 8% terminal rates. Q3 : How much lower will stocks go? Well, honestly speaking, we are 100% going into a severe recession coz Jim Cramer said recession is gonna be mild. So -50% from the top. ( We will talk more about this later or you can just check my last post for this ) Q4 : What is coming ""Short Recession"", ""Stagflation"", ""Depression"" ? First will come stagflation coz we money printed so much in 2020. It takes 2yr for full effect of monetary policy plus supply inflation from China, not Russia, because China went into lockdown mode, meaning less demand for oil and gas. Hence they will go down. No comments about other commodity. Now we are tightening so deflation will come from 2023 to 2025 if the FED went with a rate hike to 4%. We will also get our forgotten depression of 1921 somewhere around here for 1yr, which is also called as longer-lasting recession for more than 1yr. Lets see how it all unfolds. Q5 : What's the big deal with Liquidity? For this I suggest first watching Ray Dalio's video about how the economy works. Remember, HFs have access to a liquidity pool. Then we have pension funds on top of it. And on top of them we have VCs, and on top of them private equity. And at last we have retailers. Then analyze these charts below and come to your own conclusion. ( These charts are by the author of Capital Wars, who is considered the father of liquidity ) 60 months bond market theory We are currently in turbulence But how about Q6 that no one of you is asking or thinking about it? This shall be your H.W. Q6 : What's up with Forex market ? Especially japan and euro. https://twitter.com/KshitizBisht/status/1511280830739775490?s=20&t=SOPpcPJ3779w1niMvdFf6g Remember : Dollar is strengthening, meaning other currencies will lose its value more in dollars if they are not starting the tightening cycle. Hence JPY is getting destroyed. For Euro, well, wars and recession make it bad for investors to hold the EURO. So again with lots of love. Keep enjoying your time. Remember to take the vacations in May like institutions would. Thank you. Sorry for ending weirdly. I'm a weirdo, who is tired. I wanna go back and watch my animes and shows until institutions and HFs destroy my wonderful America. Don't know whose orders they are operating, but it all seems like a planned attack on liquidity.

Well, the stock market gave one hell of it to investors in a single day. April turned out to be the worst month for markets since 2008's October GFC. S&P500 had its worst four month since 1939 Great depression and Nasdaq since 1970. To everyone's surprise, but hey, not us, we got that -ve GDP print. And by Q4 2022, we will certainly get our recession. Things are only going to get much worse from here. So why am I saying this. Can't we all just simply short the market and make insane amounts of money in the way down. Turns out it ain't easy as it seems. Now you have got to be dealing with what we call turbulence in the market. We may go up and down, go up and down. Meaning options are pretty much useless in the market. The only choice you have got is swing trading in futures or the normal market. So find a favorite youtuber who predicted all the things in the market like Recession, bond drought, commodity shock, stock market crash etc. And if you cant find the guy then how about reading my piece below and heck even sharing with your friends about how this guy was so close to figuring it all out but he was just too damn lazy for wallstreet fast life. ( Don't try to give me a job in Dms unless you're a Warren Buffet. I love flying solo and cleaning the toilets at Black Rock. Yes, i love my job. ) So now we shall discuss the three questions that need answering : Q1 : How much is J powell gonna raise rates. So my readers know how I dont just give out my secrets that easily. I need you all to work too, and come to your own conclusions. So in my last post I gave you all the homework that what was the third observation in the chart below. Homework Chart : Yellow lines : Wage inflation , Red line : CPI inflation , White : FED rate hike The answer to that question is FED has to raise rates at least the half of what CPI annualized inflation is, or almost equal to it. Although some might argue the ""Taylor rule"" states, that its actually double, but seriously, my charts don't lie to me. So now you all must be wondering okay, so half of say like 8% is 4%. What's the big fuss about. Turns out technically your 4% is gonna go to a maximum of 8% due to IHS and trend lines breaks. So idk, what fundamental analysis or news comes around will led to such technicals. But the chart is telling me that the 10yr bonds are going to 6 to 8% by 2023, but the terminal rates are still projecting 3.2% by Aug 23. We have got room considering the labor market is robust and strong. Hypothesis 1 : Terminal rates projection will go to 6% by Aug 2023. Here’s the calculation on how it could. 50X6 = 3% + 0.25 = 3.25% by eoy. 5 X 0.50 = 2.5% Total = 5.75% So what impact will it have ? Almost certainly you're gonna get recession coz you will be raising rates in a contracting economy. At the end of large cycles we have Recession Hypothesis 2 : FED-U turns and doesn't raise rates over 2% Welcome to Japan, where you keep your bond yields down, inflate the dollar by printing even more and send all your assets to the moon. Note : ""Million Dollar Advise"" Lets also look at a GDP chart over here which only the few selected people on Wall Street know about. GDP negative print vs Stock Market crash This chart tells us well the first negative print is priced in the market. Question now remains whether the next GDP no’s are going to be positive or negative. - If we are going to get positive no’s by July then the stock market should go up in Q2. - if we are gonna get that 2nd negative print and complete the definition of 2Q of negative GDP growth, you're talking about -50% in Q2 itself. So you have got a lot of number crunching to do with big banks and institutions reading my post. Retailers don't try it. Just keep buying the dip with cash i told you to accumulate. Don't rush in coz, buying stocks, this year is going to be like buying groceries. Or you can just place your first two orders at -30% & -40% and cancel the noise. Q2 : How much will Bond get destroyed We have talked about this in “ Credit risk america “ post that bonds are to be bought b/w May 16- June 16. At least that's what historical technicals in TLT are telling me, which is an iShare 20yr ETF. As for 10yr bonds idk guys. This bond is tricky. It follows the terminal rate which is currently 3.2%. My calculation says 6%. So more sell-off, I guess. Terminal Rate Remember : iShare is historical pattern and 10yr bonds is current T.A. pattern. One of them will be right. Its either gonna be buying bonds buying at may 15-june 15 or buying bonds at 6 or 8% terminal rates. Q3 : How much lower will stocks go? Well, honestly speaking, we are 100% going into a severe recession coz Jim Cramer said recession is gonna be mild. So -50% from the top. ( We will talk more about this later or you can just check my last post for this ) Q4 : What is coming ""Short Recession"", ""Stagflation"", ""Depression"" ? First will come stagflation coz we money printed so much in 2020. It takes 2yr for full effect of monetary policy plus supply inflation from China, not Russia, because China went into lockdown mode, meaning less demand for oil and gas. Hence they will go down. No comments about other commodity. Now we are tightening so deflation will come from 2023 to 2025 if the FED went with a rate hike to 4%. We will also get our forgotten depression of 1921 somewhere around here for 1yr, which is also called as longer-lasting recession for more than 1yr. Lets see how it all unfolds. Q5 : What's the big deal with Liquidity? For this I suggest first watching Ray Dalio's video about how the economy works. Remember, HFs have access to a liquidity pool. Then we have pension funds on top of it. And on top of them we have VCs, and on top of them private equity. And at last we have retailers. Then analyze these charts below and come to your own conclusion. ( These charts are by the author of Capital Wars, who is considered the father of liquidity ) 60 months bond market theory We are currently in turbulence But how about Q6 that no one of you is asking or thinking about it? This shall be your H.W. Q6 : What's up with Forex market ? Especially japan and euro. https://twitter.com/KshitizBisht/status/1511280830739775490?s=20&t=SOPpcPJ3779w1niMvdFf6g Remember : Dollar is strengthening, meaning other currencies will lose its value more in dollars if they are not starting the tightening cycle. Hence JPY is getting destroyed. For Euro, well, wars and recession make it bad for investors to hold the EURO. So again with lots of love. Keep enjoying your time. Remember to take the vacations in May like institutions would. Thank you. Sorry for ending weirdly. I'm a weirdo, who is tired. I wanna go back and watch my animes and shows until institutions and HFs destroy my wonderful America. Don't know whose orders they are operating, but it all seems like a planned attack on liquidity. Regards Uchiha",Why am i getting blocked everytime ?,1,0.502,NEGATIVE,0.985
,"Respected Traders and Investors, Sobbing and crying :_( I’m sorry guys. I think I let you all down. This understanding of the stock market that i had in my head that fundamental analysis is nothing compared to technical analysis and i could just cut all the background noise by just simply looking at the charts. I thought, why in the world should I crunch numbers that these Wall Street HFs and institutions try to do. I’m so better than this. So I keep going to bars and having drinks, partying all night, using tinder, etc, thinking when an exit liquidity rally to ATH comes about in July-August 2022, I will short the entire market. And soon Wall Street will remember me as the only guy who saw it all coming to the perfect date. So I created this illusion in my head that in Q4 2022 we will 10000% get our recession because the liquidity in the market was starting to decrease. So I told literally every huge player on Wall Street about this macro idea. I also try to impose my thoughts on each one of you that in Q4 we will have a recession. But I got so deluded into my illusionary world that I never tried to calculate could we be early to a recession even before Q4. Now, it turns out, we could. 2Q of -ve GDP could come by July. Its a 50% chance though. Meaning if it happens i ain't gonna get the glory for this crisis. Jeremy Grantham and Michael Burry are. So im gonna piss off in the corner writing this post. Lets quickly recap how it all unfolded this week, but before we do that lets look at the prediction we did beforehand for the most crazy week in my last post. Earnings went horrible, hence Case 2 is being followed. Earnings season : As we all know this week, earnings were going to be the most important one going forward for Q2 because 5/6 megacaps carried $8T in S&P500. We also had GDP no coming out on Thursday, as we discussed in my last post. Lets see how it all went. Tech Earnings Season April 25 ( Monday ) : Coco-cola Analysis Monday was pretty brutal for Asian Markets because China was further going into lockdown. We also had a palm oil ban on exports. But in the USA something happened. DXY went up, but the bonds yields went down, meaning people were buying USA bonds for safe havens or maybe dumping Chinese bonds for the USA. KO Earnings When Cocola earnings came out they beat est. because they had raised prices of their drinks and were kinda flaunting corporate greed on the balance sheet, or some might argue, they were just preparing themselves for recession or stagflation. So the stock rallied monetarily for the day and had a positive effect on the stock market. KO T.A. As for technicals, you can clearly see in the 1hr chart the stocks had what you call ""Bearish divergence"" and then the stock went down to test lower levels later on in the week when everything was getting hammered. If the candles start closing below the white line then the buy zone for dip buying would be the green lines, which are close to 1.618. April 26 ( Tuesday ) : Microsoft and Alphabhet ( Good cop bad cop ) Boi oh boi this day will be remembered by many people in the upcoming months. MSFT Earnings Microsoft kickstarted the show with a beating est. Hence stock rallied. They too had earnings quite similar to Coke.. MSFT T.A. As for technicals, well, the earnings were great so im not expecting a 1.618 but just 1 fib guarantees for the ABC correction wave. GOOGL Earnings Bot now came the google earnings in after hours. Markets had gone up because of Microsoft. Everyone got confident, well Google is the most profitable business on the planet. Surely they wont miss anything. But revenue and net income came below exp. Youtube got hit badly by advertising. Maybe people are going out more often and don't watch YouTube that much more as was the case in the pandemic. Also, finance YouTubers are doing horribly badly. But the company announced a dividend in the form of a share buyback of $70B, but the market was still not happy. The stock dropped -5% in post market hours. But visa earnings came quite well, so the market was gonna be in a jolly mood the next day because transactional revenue was growing, meaning people were buying the dips. GOOGL T.A. As for technicals, the 1.618 in the ABC correction wave is coming 100%. The price action looks so weak that im not even bothering to use divergences. Just keep buying this stock at support levels. April 27 ( Wednesday ) : Meta Paypal Pinterest Qualcomm ( Pack of 4 ) Oh these guys, im not gonna bother with their charts or balance sheet because everything was pretty simple in their balance sheet and T.A. Well Meta is kinda based on the principles of Netflix. Only subscribers matter. So daily users increased, but monthly users didn't. EPS went up, and also the stock was already beaten that badly it had no choice but to go up. Paypal kinda had earnings like Visa. Transactional revenue was growing. Pins as Meta was beaten up bad. It beat estimates, monthly users declined, but it went up because revenue per user increased. Qualcomm, I have no idea. April 28 ( Thursday ) : Amazon and Apple AMZN Earnings AAPL Earnings Thursday was all about Apple and Amazon. Everyone knew before that Amazon would miss earnings because of the Rivian thing and Apple sales were gonna be strong. So what happened? No one expected Amazon's earnings to come in this horribly. Now reports are coming in that everyone hates Bezos XD. Also, Apple did an outlook thing for Q2 that they will get hit badly because of chips supply chains. Since Q1 earnings are already priced, what better way for Q2 than by shorting the company as directed by Tim. AMZN T.A. AAPL T.A. As for Amazon technicals, surely by know you might have heard of the wyckoff distribution and accumulation. Green box should hold accumulation else it could turn out to be redistribution. For Apple, well, in short $138-139 support is coming 100%. April 29 ( Friday ) : Judgement Day Think of it as the day when the court gives its final verdict. Well, the stock market gave one hell of it to investors in a single day. April turned out to be the worst month for markets since 2008's October GFC.

Now you have got to be dealing with what we call turbulence in the market. We may go up and down, go up and down. Meaning options are pretty much useless in the market. The only choice you have got is swing trading in futures or the normal market. So find a favorite youtuber who predicted all the things in the market like Recession, bond drought, commodity shock, stock market crash etc. And if you cant find the guy then how about reading my piece below and heck even sharing with your friends about how this guy was so close to figuring it all out but he was just too damn lazy for wallstreet fast life. ( Don't try to give me a job in Dms unless you're a Warren Buffet. I love flying solo and cleaning the toilets at Black Rock. Yes, i love my job. ) So now we shall discuss the three questions that need answering : Q1 : How much is J powell gonna raise rates.

It takes 2yr for full effect of monetary policy plus supply inflation from China, not Russia, because China went into lockdown mode, meaning less demand for oil and gas. Hence they will go down. No comments about other commodity. Now we are tightening so deflation will come from 2023 to 2025 if the FED went with a rate hike to 4%. We will also get our forgotten depression of 1921 somewhere around here for 1yr, which is also called as longer-lasting recession for more than 1yr. Lets see how it all unfolds. Q5 : What's the big deal with Liquidity? For this I suggest first watching Ray Dalio's video about how the economy works. Remember, HFs have access to a liquidity pool. Then we have pension funds on top of it. And on top of them we have VCs, and on top of them private equity. And at last we have retailers. Then analyze these charts below and come to your own conclusion. ( These charts are by the author of Capital Wars, who is considered the father of liquidity ) 60 months bond market theory We are currently in turbulence But how about Q6 that no one of you is asking or thinking about it? This shall be your H.W. Q6 : What's up with Forex market ? Especially japan and euro. https://twitter.com/KshitizBisht/status/1511280830739775490?s=20&t=SOPpcPJ3779w1niMvdFf6g Remember : Dollar is strengthening, meaning other currencies will lose its value more in dollars if they are not starting the tightening cycle. Hence JPY is getting destroyed. For Euro, well, wars and recession make it bad for investors to hold the EURO. So again with lots of love. Keep enjoying your time. Remember to take the vacations in May like institutions would. Thank you. Sorry for ending weirdly. I'm a weirdo, who is tired. I wanna go back and watch my animes and shows until institutions and HFs destroy my wonderful America. Don't know whose orders they are operating, but it all seems like a planned attack on liquidity. Regards Uchiha","Really i literally posted first thing the direction how it will all be unfolded using case 2 in my last post : Lots of puts before FOMC, short-lived gamma squeeze then May 9 victory day where we will drop again.

,"Respected Traders and Investors, Sobbing and crying :_( I’m sorry guys. I think I let you all down. This understanding of the stock market that i had in my head that fundamental analysis is nothing compared to technical analysis and i could just cut all the background noise by just simply looking at the charts. I thought, why in the world should I crunch numbers that these Wall Street HFs and institutions try to do. I’m so better than this. So I keep going to bars and having drinks, partying all night, using tinder, etc, thinking when an exit liquidity rally to ATH comes about in July-August 2022, I will short the entire market. And soon Wall Street will remember me as the only guy who saw it all coming to the perfect date. So I created this illusion in my head that in Q4 2022 we will 10000% get our recession because the liquidity in the market was starting to decrease. So I told literally every huge player on Wall Street about this macro idea. I also try to impose my thoughts on each one of you that in Q4 we will have a recession. But I got so deluded into my illusionary world that I never tried to calculate could we be early to a recession even before Q4. Now, it turns out, we could. 2Q of -ve GDP could come by July. Its a 50% chance though. Meaning if it happens i ain't gonna get the glory for this crisis. Jeremy Grantham and Michael Burry are. So im gonna piss off in the corner writing this post. Lets quickly recap how it all unfolded this week, but before we do that lets look at the prediction we did beforehand for the most crazy week in my last post. Earnings went horrible, hence Case 2 is being followed. Earnings season : As we all know this week, earnings were going to be the most important one going forward for Q2 because 5/6 megacaps carried $8T in S&P500. We also had GDP no coming out on Thursday, as we discussed in my last post. Lets see how it all went. Tech Earnings Season April 25 ( Monday ) : Coco-cola Analysis Monday was pretty brutal for Asian Markets because China was further going into lockdown. We also had a palm oil ban on exports. But in the USA something happened. DXY went up, but the bonds yields went down, meaning people were buying USA bonds for safe havens or maybe dumping Chinese bonds for the USA. KO Earnings When Cocola earnings came out they beat est. because they had raised prices of their drinks and were kinda flaunting corporate greed on the balance sheet, or some might argue, they were just preparing themselves for recession or stagflation. So the stock rallied monetarily for the day and had a positive effect on the stock market. KO T.A. As for technicals, you can clearly see in the 1hr chart the stocks had what you call ""Bearish divergence"" and then the stock went down to test lower levels later on in the week when everything was getting hammered. If the candles start closing below the white line then the buy zone for dip buying would be the green lines, which are close to 1.618. April 26 ( Tuesday ) : Microsoft and Alphabhet ( Good cop bad cop ) Boi oh boi this day will be remembered by many people in the upcoming months. MSFT Earnings Microsoft kickstarted the show with a beating est. Hence stock rallied. They too had earnings quite similar to Coke.. MSFT T.A. As for technicals, well, the earnings were great so im not expecting a 1.618 but just 1 fib guarantees for the ABC correction wave. GOOGL Earnings Bot now came the google earnings in after hours. Markets had gone up because of Microsoft. Everyone got confident, well Google is the most profitable business on the planet. Surely they wont miss anything. But revenue and net income came below exp. Youtube got hit badly by advertising. Maybe people are going out more often and don't watch YouTube that much more as was the case in the pandemic. Also, finance YouTubers are doing horribly badly. But the company announced a dividend in the form of a share buyback of $70B, but the market was still not happy. The stock dropped -5% in post market hours. But visa earnings came quite well, so the market was gonna be in a jolly mood the next day because transactional revenue was growing, meaning people were buying the dips. GOOGL T.A. As for technicals, the 1.618 in the ABC correction wave is coming 100%. The price action looks so weak that im not even bothering to use divergences. Just keep buying this stock at support levels. April 27 ( Wednesday ) : Meta Paypal Pinterest Qualcomm ( Pack of 4 ) Oh these guys, im not gonna bother with their charts or balance sheet because everything was pretty simple in their balance sheet and T.A. Well Meta is kinda based on the principles of Netflix. Only subscribers matter. So daily users increased, but monthly users didn't. EPS went up, and also the stock was already beaten that badly it had no choice but to go up. Paypal kinda had earnings like Visa. Transactional revenue was growing. Pins as Meta was beaten up bad. It beat estimates, monthly users declined, but it went up because revenue per user increased. Qualcomm, I have no idea. April 28 ( Thursday ) : Amazon and Apple AMZN Earnings AAPL Earnings Thursday was all about Apple and Amazon. Everyone knew before that Amazon would miss earnings because of the Rivian thing and Apple sales were gonna be strong. So what happened? No one expected Amazon's earnings to come in this horribly. Now reports are coming in that everyone hates Bezos XD. Also, Apple did an outlook thing for Q2 that they will get hit badly because of chips supply chains. Since Q1 earnings are already priced, what better way for Q2 than by shorting the company as directed by Tim. AMZN T.A. AAPL T.A. As for Amazon technicals, surely by know you might have heard of the wyckoff distribution and accumulation. Green box should hold accumulation else it could turn out to be redistribution. For Apple, well, in short $138-139 support is coming 100%. April 29 ( Friday ) : Judgement Day Think of it as the day when the court gives its final verdict. Well, the stock market gave one hell of it to investors in a single day. April turned out to be the worst month for markets since 2008's October GFC. S&P500 had its worst four month since 1939 Great depression and Nasdaq since 1970. To everyone's surprise, but hey, not us, we got that -ve GDP print. And by Q4 2022, we will certainly get our recession. Things are only going to get much worse from here. So why am I saying this. Can't we all just simply short the market and make insane amounts of money in the way down. Turns out it ain't easy as it seems. Now you have got to be dealing with what we call turbulence in the market. We may go up and down, go up and down. Meaning options are pretty much useless in the market. The only choice you have got is swing trading in futures or the normal market. So find a favorite youtuber who predicted all the things in the market like Recession, bond drought, commodity shock, stock market crash etc. And if you cant find the guy then how about reading my piece below and heck even sharing with your friends about how this guy was so close to figuring it all out but he was just too damn lazy for wallstreet fast life. ( Don't try to give me a job in Dms unless you're a Warren Buffet. I love flying solo and cleaning the toilets at Black Rock. Yes, i love my job. ) So now we shall discuss the three questions that need answering : Q1 : How much is J powell gonna raise rates. So my readers know how I dont just give out my secrets that easily. I need you all to work too, and come to your own conclusions. So in my last post I gave you all the homework that what was the third observation in the chart below. Homework Chart : Yellow lines : Wage inflation , Red line : CPI inflation , White : FED rate hike The answer to that question is FED has to raise rates at least the half of what CPI annualized inflation is, or almost equal to it. Although some might argue the ""Taylor rule"" states, that its actually double, but seriously, my charts don't lie to me. So now you all must be wondering okay, so half of say like 8% is 4%. What's the big fuss about. Turns out technically your 4% is gonna go to a maximum of 8% due to IHS and trend lines breaks. So idk, what fundamental analysis or news comes around will led to such technicals. But the chart is telling me that the 10yr bonds are going to 6 to 8% by 2023, but the terminal rates are still projecting 3.2% by Aug 23. We have got room considering the labor market is robust and strong. Hypothesis 1 : Terminal rates projection will go to 6% by Aug 2023. Here’s the calculation on how it could. 50X6 = 3% + 0.25 = 3.25% by eoy. 5 X 0.50 = 2.5% Total = 5.75% So what impact will it have ? Almost certainly you're gonna get recession coz you will be raising rates in a contracting economy. At the end of large cycles we have Recession Hypothesis 2 : FED-U turns and doesn't raise rates over 2% Welcome to Japan, where you keep your bond yields down, inflate the dollar by printing even more and send all your assets to the moon. Note : ""Million Dollar Advise"" Lets also look at a GDP chart over here which only the few selected people on Wall Street know about. GDP negative print vs Stock Market crash This chart tells us well the first negative print is priced in the market. Question now remains whether the next GDP no’s are going to be positive or negative. - If we are going to get positive no’s by July then the stock market should go up in Q2. - if we are gonna get that 2nd negative print and complete the definition of 2Q of negative GDP growth, you're talking about -50% in Q2 itself. So you have got a lot of number crunching to do with big banks and institutions reading my post. Retailers don't try it. Just keep buying the dip with cash i told you to accumulate. Don't rush in coz, buying stocks, this year is going to be like buying groceries. Or you can just place your first two orders at -30% & -40% and cancel the noise. Q2 : How much will Bond get destroyed We have talked about this in “ Credit risk america “ post that bonds are to be bought b/w May 16- June 16. At least that's what historical technicals in TLT are telling me, which is an iShare 20yr ETF. As for 10yr bonds idk guys. This bond is tricky. It follows the terminal rate which is currently 3.2%. My calculation says 6%. So more sell-off, I guess. Terminal Rate Remember : iShare is historical pattern and 10yr bonds is current T.A. pattern. One of them will be right. Its either gonna be buying bonds buying at may 15-june 15 or buying bonds at 6 or 8% terminal rates. Q3 : How much lower will stocks go? Well, honestly speaking, we are 100% going into a severe recession coz Jim Cramer said recession is gonna be mild. So -50% from the top. ( We will talk more about this later or you can just check my last post for this ) Q4 : What is coming ""Short Recession"", ""Stagflation"", ""Depression"" ? First will come stagflation coz we money printed so much in 2020. It takes 2yr for full effect of monetary policy plus supply inflation from China, not Russia, because China went into lockdown mode, meaning less demand for oil and gas. Hence they will go down.

As for technicals, well, the earnings were great so im not expecting a 1.618 but just 1 fib guarantees for the ABC correction wave. GOOGL Earnings Bot now came the google earnings in after hours. Markets had gone up because of Microsoft. Everyone got confident, well Google is the most profitable business on the planet. Surely they wont miss anything. But revenue and net income came below exp. Youtube got hit badly by advertising. Maybe people are going out more often and don't watch YouTube that much more as was the case in the pandemic. Also, finance YouTubers are doing horribly badly. But the company announced a dividend in the form of a share buyback of $70B, but the market was still not happy. The stock dropped -5% in post market hours. But visa earnings came quite well, so the market was gonna be in a jolly mood the next day because transactional revenue was growing, meaning people were buying the dips. GOOGL T.A. As for technicals, the 1.618 in the ABC correction wave is coming 100%. The price action looks so weak that im not even bothering to use divergences. Just keep buying this stock at support levels. April 27 ( Wednesday ) : Meta Paypal Pinterest Qualcomm ( Pack of 4 ) Oh these guys, im not gonna bother with their charts or balance sheet because everything was pretty simple in their balance sheet and T.A. Well Meta is kinda based on the principles of Netflix. Only subscribers matter. So daily users increased, but monthly users didn't. EPS went up, and also the stock was already beaten that badly it had no choice but to go up. Paypal kinda had earnings like Visa. Transactional revenue was growing. Pins as Meta was beaten up bad. It beat estimates, monthly users declined, but it went up because revenue per user increased. Qualcomm, I have no idea. April 28 ( Thursday ) : Amazon and Apple AMZN Earnings AAPL Earnings Thursday was all about Apple and Amazon. Everyone knew before that Amazon would miss earnings because of the Rivian thing and Apple sales were gonna be strong. So what happened? No one expected Amazon's earnings to come in this horribly. Now reports are coming in that everyone hates Bezos XD. Also, Apple did an outlook thing for Q2 that they will get hit badly because of chips supply chains. Since Q1 earnings are already priced, what better way for Q2 than by shorting the company as directed by Tim. AMZN T.A. AAPL T.A. As for Amazon technicals, surely by know you might have heard of the wyckoff distribution and accumulation. Green box should hold accumulation else it could turn out to be redistribution. For Apple, well, in short $138-139 support is coming 100%. April 29 ( Friday ) : Judgement Day Think of it as the day when the court gives its final verdict. Well, the stock market gave one hell of it to investors in a single day. April turned out to be the worst month for markets since 2008's October GFC. S&P500 had its worst four month since 1939 Great depression and Nasdaq since 1970. To everyone's surprise, but hey, not us, we got that -ve GDP print. And by Q4 2022, we will certainly get our recession. Things are only going to get much worse from here. So why am I saying this. Can't we all just simply short the market and make insane amounts of money in the way down. Turns out it ain't easy as it seems. Now you have got to be dealing with what we call turbulence in the market. We may go up and down, go up and down. Meaning options are pretty much useless in the market. The only choice you have got is swing trading in futures or the normal market. So find a favorite youtuber who predicted all the things in the market like Recession, bond drought, commodity shock, stock market crash etc. And if you cant find the guy then how about reading my piece below and heck even sharing with your friends about how this guy was so close to figuring it all out but he was just too damn lazy for wallstreet fast life. ( Don't try to give me a job in Dms unless you're a Warren Buffet. I love flying solo and cleaning the toilets at Black Rock. Yes, i love my job. ) So now we shall discuss the three questions that need answering : Q1 : How much is J powell gonna raise rates. So my readers know how I dont just give out my secrets that easily. I need you all to work too, and come to your own conclusions. So in my last post I gave you all the homework that what was the third observation in the chart below. Homework Chart : Yellow lines : Wage inflation , Red line : CPI inflation , White : FED rate hike The answer to that question is FED has to raise rates at least the half of what CPI annualized inflation is, or almost equal to it. Although some might argue the ""Taylor rule"" states, that its actually double, but seriously, my charts don't lie to me. So now you all must be wondering okay, so half of say like 8% is 4%. What's the big fuss about. Turns out technically your 4% is gonna go to a maximum of 8% due to IHS and trend lines breaks. So idk, what fundamental analysis or news comes around will led to such technicals. But the chart is telling me that the 10yr bonds are going to 6 to 8% by 2023, but the terminal rates are still projecting 3.2% by Aug 23. We have got room considering the labor market is robust and strong. Hypothesis 1 : Terminal rates projection will go to 6% by Aug 2023. Here’s the calculation on how it could. 50X6 = 3% + 0.25 = 3.25% by eoy. 5 X 0.50 = 2.5% Total = 5.75% So what impact will it have ? Almost certainly you're gonna get recession coz you will be raising rates in a contracting economy. At the end of large cycles we have Recession Hypothesis 2 : FED-U turns and doesn't raise rates over 2% Welcome to Japan, where you keep your bond yields down, inflate the dollar by printing even more and send all your assets to the moon. Note : ""Million Dollar Advise"" Lets also look at a GDP chart over here which only the few selected people on Wall Street know about. GDP negative print vs Stock Market crash This chart tells us well the first negative print is priced in the market. Question now remains whether the next GDP no’s are going to be positive or negative. - If we are going to get positive no’s by July then the stock market should go up in Q2. - if we are gonna get that 2nd negative print and complete the definition of 2Q of negative GDP growth, you're talking about -50% in Q2 itself. So you have got a lot of number crunching to do with big banks and institutions reading my post. Retailers don't try it. Just keep buying the dip with cash i told you to accumulate. Don't rush in coz, buying stocks, this year is going to be like buying groceries. Or you can just place your first two orders at -30% & -40% and cancel the noise. Q2 : How much will Bond get destroyed We have talked about this in “ Credit risk america “ post that bonds are to be bought b/w May 16- June 16. At least that's what historical technicals in TLT are telling me, which is an iShare 20yr ETF. As for 10yr bonds idk guys. This bond is tricky. It follows the terminal rate which is currently 3.2%. My calculation says 6%. So more sell-off, I guess. Terminal Rate Remember : iShare is historical pattern and 10yr bonds is current T.A. pattern. One of them will be right. Its either gonna be buying bonds buying at may 15-june 15 or buying bonds at 6 or 8% terminal rates. Q3 : How much lower will stocks go? Well, honestly speaking, we are 100% going into a severe recession coz Jim Cramer said recession is gonna be mild. So -50% from the top. ( We will talk more about this later or you can just check my last post for this ) Q4 : What is coming ""Short Recession"", ""Stagflation"", ""Depression"" ? First will come stagflation coz we money printed so much in 2020. It takes 2yr for full effect of monetary policy plus supply inflation from China, not Russia, because China went into lockdown mode, meaning less demand for oil and gas. Hence they will go down. No comments about other commodity. Now we are tightening so deflation will come from 2023 to 2025 if the FED went with a rate hike to 4%. We will also get our forgotten depression of 1921 somewhere around here for 1yr, which is also called as longer-lasting recession for more than 1yr. Lets see how it all unfolds. Q5 : What's the big deal with Liquidity? For this I suggest first watching Ray Dalio's video about how the economy works. Remember, HFs have access to a liquidity pool. Then we have pension funds on top of it. And on top of them we have VCs, and on top of them private equity. And at last we have retailers. Then analyze these charts below and come to your own conclusion. ( These charts are by the author of Capital Wars, who is considered the father of liquidity ) 60 months bond market theory We are currently in turbulence But how about Q6 that no one of you is asking or thinking about it? This shall be your H.W. Q6 : What's up with Forex market ? Especially japan and euro. https://twitter.com/KshitizBisht/status/1511280830739775490?s=20&t=SOPpcPJ3779w1niMvdFf6g Remember : Dollar is strengthening, meaning other currencies will lose its value more in dollars if they are not starting the tightening cycle. Hence JPY is getting destroyed. For Euro, well, wars and recession make it bad for investors to hold the EURO. So again with lots of love. Keep enjoying your time. Remember to take the vacations in May like institutions would. Thank you. Sorry for ending weirdly. I'm a weirdo, who is tired. I wanna go back and watch my animes and shows until institutions and HFs destroy my wonderful America. Don't know whose orders they are operating, but it all seems like a planned attack on liquidity.

,"Respected Traders and Investors, Sobbing and crying :_( I’m sorry guys. I think I let you all down. This understanding of the stock market that i had in my head that fundamental analysis is nothing compared to technical analysis and i could just cut all the background noise by just simply looking at the charts. I thought, why in the world should I crunch numbers that these Wall Street HFs and institutions try to do. I’m so better than this. So I keep going to bars and having drinks, partying all night, using tinder, etc, thinking when an exit liquidity rally to ATH comes about in July-August 2022, I will short the entire market. And soon Wall Street will remember me as the only guy who saw it all coming to the perfect date. So I created this illusion in my head that in Q4 2022 we will 10000% get our recession because the liquidity in the market was starting to decrease. So I told literally every huge player on Wall Street about this macro idea. I also try to impose my thoughts on each one of you that in Q4 we will have a recession. But I got so deluded into my illusionary world that I never tried to calculate could we be early to a recession even before Q4. Now, it turns out, we could. 2Q of -ve GDP could come by July. Its a 50% chance though. Meaning if it happens i ain't gonna get the glory for this crisis. Jeremy Grantham and Michael Burry are. So im gonna piss off in the corner writing this post. Lets quickly recap how it all unfolded this week, but before we do that lets look at the prediction we did beforehand for the most crazy week in my last post. Earnings went horrible, hence Case 2 is being followed. Earnings season : As we all know this week, earnings were going to be the most important one going forward for Q2 because 5/6 megacaps carried $8T in S&P500. We also had GDP no coming out on Thursday, as we discussed in my last post. Lets see how it all went. Tech Earnings Season April 25 ( Monday ) : Coco-cola Analysis Monday was pretty brutal for Asian Markets because China was further going into lockdown. We also had a palm oil ban on exports. But in the USA something happened. DXY went up, but the bonds yields went down, meaning people were buying USA bonds for safe havens or maybe dumping Chinese bonds for the USA. KO Earnings When Cocola earnings came out they beat est. because they had raised prices of their drinks and were kinda flaunting corporate greed on the balance sheet, or some might argue, they were just preparing themselves for recession or stagflation. So the stock rallied monetarily for the day and had a positive effect on the stock market. KO T.A. As for technicals, you can clearly see in the 1hr chart the stocks had what you call ""Bearish divergence"" and then the stock went down to test lower levels later on in the week when everything was getting hammered. If the candles start closing below the white line then the buy zone for dip buying would be the green lines, which are close to 1.618. April 26 ( Tuesday ) : Microsoft and Alphabhet ( Good cop bad cop ) Boi oh boi this day will be remembered by many people in the upcoming months. MSFT Earnings Microsoft kickstarted the show with a beating est. Hence stock rallied. They too had earnings quite similar to Coke.. MSFT T.A.

Youtube got hit badly by advertising. Maybe people are going out more often and don't watch YouTube that much more as was the case in the pandemic. Also, finance YouTubers are doing horribly badly. But the company announced a dividend in the form of a share buyback of $70B, but the market was still not happy. The stock dropped -5% in post market hours. But visa earnings came quite well, so the market was gonna be in a jolly mood the next day because transactional revenue was growing, meaning people were buying the dips. GOOGL T.A. As for technicals, the 1.618 in the ABC correction wave is coming 100%. The price action looks so weak that im not even bothering to use divergences. Just keep buying this stock at support levels. April 27 ( Wednesday ) : Meta Paypal Pinterest Qualcomm ( Pack of 4 ) Oh these guys, im not gonna bother with their charts or balance sheet because everything was pretty simple in their balance sheet and T.A. Well Meta is kinda based on the principles of Netflix. Only subscribers matter. So daily users increased, but monthly users didn't.

As for Amazon technicals, surely by know you might have heard of the wyckoff distribution and accumulation. Green box should hold accumulation else it could turn out to be redistribution. For Apple, well, in short $138-139 support is coming 100%. April 29 ( Friday ) : Judgement Day Think of it as the day when the court gives its final verdict. Well, the stock market gave one hell of it to investors in a single day. April turned out to be the worst month for markets since 2008's October GFC.
