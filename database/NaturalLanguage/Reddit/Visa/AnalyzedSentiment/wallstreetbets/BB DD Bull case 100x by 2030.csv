,"Retard TLDR: BlackBerry IVY is like the browser, it unlocks a shit ton of monetization opportunities. BB 100x by 2030. 🚀🚀🚀🚀 IVY is the upcoming vehicle data platform built by BB with AWS providing the infrastructure. According the McKinsey, potential revenue generated by car data will reach 450-750B by 2030. This was written back in 2016 so I'd say this estimate should be at least 50% higher. Thanks JPOW.

That's literally ALL of the major car companies in the world. By having an existing business relationship with them BB will take them to bed and make sweet love to them with their IVY dildo. If you look at current ""platform"" revenue models from VISA to AAPL, the platform can take in anywhere from 2.5% to 30% of the revenue. Given a 50% market share and 15% revenue share that would be 50B revenue a year for BB. Thats ONLY from cars. They can expand the data platform to other embedded platforms like... anything you fucking want. By 2030 Starbucks' coffee cup's gonna be an embedded system. Risks: Car companies are known fuck ups.

So, we announced IVY, which is the intelligent vehicle everywhere. So, IVY is a cloud-connected and cross platform that is multi-OS, multi-cloud, in-car software that allows automakers to access a vehicle sensor data in compliance with safety and security requirements to process that data with updatable code to create new vehicle insights and then share those insights with developers through a consistent and simple in-car API mechanism....Right. So, it's a 50-50 joint development. And something I didn't stress enough in the last question, just to be clear, this is OS and cloud agnostic. No dependency on AWS cloud and no dependency on QNX. This is truly a generic piece of middleware to create this ecosystem. So, obviously, we're doing development on QNX. We expect QNX to be the high runner within the vehicle because of our dominant position in the car.
