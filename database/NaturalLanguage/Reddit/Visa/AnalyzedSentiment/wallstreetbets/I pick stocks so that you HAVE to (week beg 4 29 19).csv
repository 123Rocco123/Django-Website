AMD - AMD [bear]: $27.88: ryzen is pretty cool. for this pick i just stuck a piece of paper up my ass and if it was brown i go bear if it stayed clean i go bull. you know what came out my ass now. Yum! Brands, Inc. - YUM [bull]: $104.09: i looked at the chart for 2 seconds on this one. taco bell, kfc, pizza hut. very good food but some people are feeling healthier or are trying to i think. not sure; not a fan. regardless, i love all 3 places but pizza hut needs to lower prices because domino's is a little better. this one is probably wrong but food is food so food is necessary. go long. or not i don't care Planet Fitness - PLNT [bull]: $76.22: this one is somewhat personal to me. a lot of my friends have left PF for other clubs as PF does not have free weights or whatever. i don't work out so i wouldn't know any of this shit. anyways with that coming in i would have easily said bear this motherfucker. but then i look chart. then i get kind of horny. i cannot explain the growth or the gains. but it, (like i) is inevitable. so all the way tits up. i'm definitely going 4-5 after this week lmao. i hope you guys have a great week and i hope you enjoy my autism from the future as the first week was kind of a mindfuck, even for me. never do i go 4-0 like that. then again, all the fucking notes i made i DID NOT play on lmaooo. i did not buy or sell any of the stocks i talked aobut last week. i guess it only goes the other way if i actually enter positions. and that is why stock market is scam. but anyways disclosure i probably won't be entering any of these stocks either to see what happens. do with this as you will. time for the night king to kill everyone and i'm going to have a great night. NK all winter long bois. muah P.S. WHATEVER IT TAKES wow wow wow i went 4-0 lmaooooo",Hmmm.,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE
