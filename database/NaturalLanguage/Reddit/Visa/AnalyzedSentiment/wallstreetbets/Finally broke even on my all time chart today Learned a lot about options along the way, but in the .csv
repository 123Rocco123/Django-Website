,"https://i.imgur.com/qRayGV3.png Late September of 2018 I decided to buy my first options. I traded Visa about a week before the recession of 2018 kicked in. From then on I had big jumps, whether it from iron condors, put spreads, you name it, but always eventually blew up my $300 account and put $200 in to get back to trading. Did this for a year and a half. Got a $3000 Christmas bonus and thought to myself it would be better to go long and really maximize these jumps when stonks only go up, rather than limited profits on put spreads. On New Years I realized that I wasn’t playing the market to the maximum advantage selling put spreads on major movers like Apple and Nvidia, since if I went long I’d probably make more money. So I bought the NVDA and Apple dips that week, NVDA at 232.5 month out calls and Apple month out calls at 292.5. Combined with some LULU, and Goldman Sachs spreads, I was able to sell NVDA and AAPL long calls for $400 profit on each of them. Yesterday we had that end of day dip, I bought at the money calls for 1/31 expiration on Apple and Nvidia both expecting a pop today at open. I sold at open for $370 up between the two and finally broke even today. We’ll see how the rest of 2020 goes, but the first week and a half has been pretty good so far. Tomorrow I’m going to transfer my account from Robinhood to Think or Swim. RH is just too simplistic. Now that I’ve got a decent sized stack, I decided I want to use a real brokerage that’s got all of the bells and whistles attached. TL;DR: basically lost $1600 in the course of learning how to trade options and I finally broke my all time profit loss ceiling since I started trading in September of 2018.","Congrats i went green today, not the first time but the first stable time, also. Was Tesla put FDs and AMRN short calls for me.",0,0.546,1.0,POSITIVE
