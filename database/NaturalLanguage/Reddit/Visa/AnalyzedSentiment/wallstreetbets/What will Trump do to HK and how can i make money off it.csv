,"As you might heard this Tuesday, Trump has said that he will announce his response to Hong Kong’s escalating crisis before the end of this week and has described his new response to be “new”, “interesting” and “powerful”. Yesterday, secertary Pompeo has said that Hong Kong’s autonomy is gone, no longer acts in the way the British intended and does not qualify for the 1997 economic treaty which gives Hong Kong special perks on trading with America. Now there are 3 scenarios to how this is going to play out. Scenario 1- Trump demoting HK’s economic perks with US which would mean tariffs on exports, tightening exchange rate policies, and visa restrictions which would consequently remove Hong Kong as Asia’s financial hub and hurt the Chinese economy. Beijing has stated that there would be counter-measures if the US would interfere in its internal affair. Scenario 2- Trump announces sanctions and tariffs on China while most likely buying or subsidizing China’s tariff retaliation Scenario 3- Weaker action, denouncing what’s happening to Hong Kong while promoting US companies to move it’s supply chains back locally. Last time the trade war happend, it hurt the US economically most noticeably in the midwest where most Trump supporters reside. With the 2020 election coming, Scenario 3 is the most likely outcome with not much impact to the markets. However, Scenario 1 is the most exciting route which would hopefully turn me Gay again. Another thing worth mentioning is that Lil Yachty will be releasing his album tomorrow.
