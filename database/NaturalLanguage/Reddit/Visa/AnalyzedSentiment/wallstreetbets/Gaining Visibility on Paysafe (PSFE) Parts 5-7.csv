,"Here are Parts 5 - 7 of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1- 4 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit as well as available float. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 5. Blackstone Group Many have blamed PSFE’s price decline on insider selling by pointing to Blackstone Group’s most recent 13F filings indicating a 23% reduction of their position. However, cross-referencing that 13F and the most recent SEC filing with Paysafe’s March 31 20F (p.124) shows that Blackstone holds the exact same number of shares as they did at the time of merger: 123.7 million shares. It’s true, private equity lockups expired months ago and the 13F appears to show a sale of 37 million shares between Q1 and Q2. BUT, to believe that they sold those shares then you’d also have to believe that they BOUGHT 37 million shares (a half billion dollar stake) in Q1, PRIOR to their payout from merger, and then immediately turned around and sold that exact same amount of shares for a SIGNIFICANT loss, just after merger. Seems like quite a stretch. When asked directly about Blackstone’s 13F and whether they’d sold shares, Paysafe’s investor relations responded, ""That swing in the 13F position was an issue with the 13F filing, but I see how that was confusing.  It was not reflective of any actual open market selling of Paysafe stock."" Make of it what you will, but there’s no denying that the most recent records show that Blackstone still holds the same number of shares as they did per the original deal structure. The same is true of CVC. Other factors to consider about Blackstone’s stake: Bears commonly claim Paysafe is overvalued because private equity made 3x on this investment. They reach this conclusion by ignoring the difference between market cap and enterprise value and by assuming PE was somehow awarded a full $9 billion from a $3 billion investment. In truth, as Reuters reported, Paysafe, “was taken private by Blackstone Group Inc and CVC Capital Partners in 2017 for $4.7 billion, inclusive of debt.” At the time of the 2021 merger, Blackstone/CVC received $2.3 billion in cash and $2.8 billion in shares. (280 million shares now worth $2.2b). At current levels, that’s a total of $4.5 billion in cash and shares. So, from their initial $3.9 billion USD (£2.96b) investment, Blackstone and CVC are currently up a mere 15%, between cash and shares. That’s after 4 years of significant strategic investment in restructuring, de-risking, replacing the Board of Directors and bringing in all new leadership (CEO, CFO, CTO, CRO, CIO, CISO etc.). This is part of a long term strategy. When taking Paysafe private, Blackstone/CVC paid “a 42% premium over the group's average value over the past year,” because, as Reuter’s reported, insiders close to the deal said private equity had “a decade-long thesis that the shift to [digital payments] will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.” This “decade-long” thesis matches Blackstone’s typical investment term of “upwards of 7-10 years” according to their published white paper. 7 to 10 years would be 2024-2027, which lines up with the FTAC board investment thesis, as outlined in their proxy statement when approving the business combination (see #9). More recently, Reuters reported: “Martin Brand, senior managing director at Blackstone, said in an interview that retaining the majority of its investment would allow the buyout firm to benefit from the expected strong performance that Paysafe will generate going forward.” Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler said, “We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.” And last month, CEO Philip McHugh assured: “You won’t see Blackstone and CVC going out there and doing big block sales any time soon. They see our story. They see the pipeline. They see the kind of top of funnel pipeline at the company where we’re gaining traction not only in US iGaming but in [digital currency], in travel and online gaming.” 6. Insider Ownership Bears have argued that lack of insider ownership is a red flag but on top of the large stake held by board members, Blackstone and CVC, Paysafe’s share registration confirms this argument is another non-starter: CEO Philip McHugh owns 2.4m shares COO Danny Chazonoff owns 2.2m shares Vice Chairman Joel Leonoff owns 8.3m shares Chairman of the Board Bill Foley owns 42m shares 3 Employee Trusts own 2.3m shares 7. Competition Bears like to claim that a large competitor will eat Paysafe’s lunch, but it’s hard to ignore the fact that Paysafe is the one now encroaching on the North American market. Along with expanding in iGaming, they’re initiating their US launch of digital wallets Skrill and Neteller, with higher limits and real-time pay-in/pay-out, which they say “fills a gap in the U.S. market.” Some theorize that Paysafe’s competitive threat is the reason it’s being shorted, so as to inhibit the company’s ability to raise capital for further acquisitions, or to prime them for a buyout. But the company has leverage to spare and, when asked directly about a buyout, the CEO was very clear that they are not interested. Speculation aside, bears who claim Paysafe will lose to competitors generally ignore how large, established, specialized and diversified Paysafe is in the global marketplace. With its focus on niche verticals, Paysafe is the undisputed leader in iGaming; it owns the second largest digital wallet in the world; it is #4 globally in integrated payment processing; it does over $100 billion in volume; it is used in 120 countries, and it is so good at multi-jurisdictional regulatory monitoring and risk management that other payment processors often use them as a middle man for transactions. This last point is a key differentiator for Paysafe. CEO McHugh: “Because it’s complicated, the risk and regulatory management in payments and gaming at a global scale is not something that’s easy to copy.” He further notes, “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem.” Paysafe’s regulatory expertise enables them to innovate and enhance their moat with new risk-management solutions in different industries like their recently developed travel safeguarding model. It’s also a major reason why most iGaming operators use Paysafe’s award winning platform (which, like any good pick and shovel play, makes them immune to the lack of brand loyalty among sports bettors who tend to migrate between iGaming operators). Often embedded behind the scenes so that customers don’t know they are using it, Paysafe offers a trusted payment gateway that so effectively mitigates transaction liability that it is commonly used as a hidden partner. They work with MasterCard, Visa, Fiserv, WorldPay(US DraftKings), Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, Sightline, REPAY, Intellipay, and a host of others. Paysafe is also behind the roll-out of the award winning Coinbase/Visa card. In most cases it would take years of significant investment for others to match Paysafe’s level of monitoring, risk management and underwriting. It’s often easier for a ""competitor"" to just give them a cut of the take. CEO McHugh notes, “That’s where we get broader and deeper take rates over time. We process with Worldpay and have a capability with Fiserv as well, so we do multi-processor there.” And Danny Chazonoff, COO, adds, “In Europe, we are the acquirer of record, so we have a principal membership with Visa and MasterCard. What that brings for us is the ability to do our own underwriting without any intervention at all from an acquiring bank.” Rather than competing directly with other payment processors, Paysafe's angle is to quietly work with everyone. This is partly why Bill Foley describes Paysafe as “ubiquitous. It’s just everywhere.” Having cited a potential $58 trillion total addressable market, rather than competing in the general retail space, they focus on drilling down in “hard to do, hard to copy” niche verticals. CEO McHugh: “That’s why we like the deep verticals as opposed to trying to go head to head in the more general retail space which is more susceptible to scale economics.” Through its emerging Unity Platform, Paysafe is also differentiating itself with a single cloud-based payment gateway that synthesizes a large suite of interconnected products and payment rails: credit and debit card processing integrated eCommerce processing online banking with real-time bank payments ACH check transactions digital wallets with real-time pay-in/pay-out functionality person to person payments in 40 currencies eCash solutions to digitize cash reaching a massive underbanked consumer base 38 [digital] currencies in over 90 markets trading in the wallet international money transfers branded gift card management recurring billing data mining for targeted direct marketing travel safeguarding for most major airlines tokenization and encryption (NFTs) in-store brick-and-mortar frictionless checkout (with competitive scalable pricing for a wider range of business sizes) As the CEO points out, “Merchants just want sales regardless of payment method…There are very few competitors that can compete with us across all of the products…we continue to see the combination of our eCommerce gateway, digital wallets, online banking, and eCash solutions as a true differentiator in the market…The company that can synthesize that onto one platform will do very well."" Reviews: While on the topic of competition, Bears who apparently aren’t aware of Paysafe’s award winning consumer products like Paysafecard and Skrill, often point to an odd Trustpilot 1.9/5 star rating of nondescript “Paysafe” with only 287 reviews. Meanwhile, they ignore Trustpilot ratings of Paysafe’s actual consumer-facing products like: Paysafecard: “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) 43K reviews Skrill: “great” (4/5 stars) 19K reviews Skrill Money Transfer: “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) 9K reviews By contrast, Trustpilot rates competitors: PayPal: “bad"" (1.2/5 stars) 20K reviews Stripe: “Average” (3.3/5 stars) 6.6K reviews Cash App: “bad” (1.2/5 stars) 3K reviews Zelle: “bad” (1.1/5 stars) 398 reviews Venmo: “bad” (1.3/5 stars) 281 reviews Note: This is not to bash competitors, but to point out how the bear argument is essentially meaningless. To be fair, those competing platforms get much better Apple mobile app reviews but, even there, Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill gets a respectable, 4.4 out of 5 stars with 7.2K ratings. And at GooglePlay, their Paysafecard gets 4.3/5 stars with over 103K reviews. Continue to Parts 8-10.",Mate.... Your DD has me buying more everytime.,0,0.51,POSITIVE,0.998

Make of it what you will, but there’s no denying that the most recent records show that Blackstone still holds the same number of shares as they did per the original deal structure. The same is true of CVC. Other factors to consider about Blackstone’s stake: Bears commonly claim Paysafe is overvalued because private equity made 3x on this investment. They reach this conclusion by ignoring the difference between market cap and enterprise value and by assuming PE was somehow awarded a full $9 billion from a $3 billion investment. In truth, as Reuters reported, Paysafe, “was taken private by Blackstone Group Inc and CVC Capital Partners in 2017 for $4.7 billion, inclusive of debt.” At the time of the 2021 merger, Blackstone/CVC received $2.3 billion in cash and $2.8 billion in shares. (280 million shares now worth $2.2b). At current levels, that’s a total of $4.5 billion in cash and shares. So, from their initial $3.9 billion USD (£2.96b) investment, Blackstone and CVC are currently up a mere 15%, between cash and shares. That’s after 4 years of significant strategic investment in restructuring, de-risking, replacing the Board of Directors and bringing in all new leadership (CEO, CFO, CTO, CRO, CIO, CISO etc.). This is part of a long term strategy. When taking Paysafe private, Blackstone/CVC paid “a 42% premium over the group's average value over the past year,” because, as Reuter’s reported, insiders close to the deal said private equity had “a decade-long thesis that the shift to [digital payments] will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.” This “decade-long” thesis matches Blackstone’s typical investment term of “upwards of 7-10 years” according to their published white paper. 7 to 10 years would be 2024-2027, which lines up with the FTAC board investment thesis, as outlined in their proxy statement when approving the business combination (see #9). More recently, Reuters reported: “Martin Brand, senior managing director at Blackstone, said in an interview that retaining the majority of its investment would allow the buyout firm to benefit from the expected strong performance that Paysafe will generate going forward.” Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler said, “We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.” And last month, CEO Philip McHugh assured: “You won’t see Blackstone and CVC going out there and doing big block sales any time soon. They see our story. They see the pipeline. They see the kind of top of funnel pipeline at the company where we’re gaining traction not only in US iGaming but in [digital currency], in travel and online gaming.” 6. Insider Ownership Bears have argued that lack of insider ownership is a red flag but on top of the large stake held by board members, Blackstone and CVC, Paysafe’s share registration confirms this argument is another non-starter: CEO Philip McHugh owns 2.4m shares COO Danny Chazonoff owns 2.2m shares Vice Chairman Joel Leonoff owns 8.3m shares Chairman of the Board Bill Foley owns 42m shares 3 Employee Trusts own 2.3m shares 7. Competition Bears like to claim that a large competitor will eat Paysafe’s lunch, but it’s hard to ignore the fact that Paysafe is the one now encroaching on the North American market. Along with expanding in iGaming, they’re initiating their US launch of digital wallets Skrill and Neteller, with higher limits and real-time pay-in/pay-out, which they say “fills a gap in the U.S. market.” Some theorize that Paysafe’s competitive threat is the reason it’s being shorted, so as to inhibit the company’s ability to raise capital for further acquisitions, or to prime them for a buyout. But the company has leverage to spare and, when asked directly about a buyout, the CEO was very clear that they are not interested. Speculation aside, bears who claim Paysafe will lose to competitors generally ignore how large, established, specialized and diversified Paysafe is in the global marketplace. With its focus on niche verticals, Paysafe is the undisputed leader in iGaming; it owns the second largest digital wallet in the world; it is #4 globally in integrated payment processing; it does over $100 billion in volume; it is used in 120 countries, and it is so good at multi-jurisdictional regulatory monitoring and risk management that other payment processors often use them as a middle man for transactions. This last point is a key differentiator for Paysafe. CEO McHugh: “Because it’s complicated, the risk and regulatory management in payments and gaming at a global scale is not something that’s easy to copy.” He further notes, “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem.” Paysafe’s regulatory expertise enables them to innovate and enhance their moat with new risk-management solutions in different industries like their recently developed travel safeguarding model. It’s also a major reason why most iGaming operators use Paysafe’s award winning platform (which, like any good pick and shovel play, makes them immune to the lack of brand loyalty among sports bettors who tend to migrate between iGaming operators). Often embedded behind the scenes so that customers don’t know they are using it, Paysafe offers a trusted payment gateway that so effectively mitigates transaction liability that it is commonly used as a hidden partner. They work with MasterCard, Visa, Fiserv, WorldPay(US DraftKings), Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, Sightline, REPAY, Intellipay, and a host of others. Paysafe is also behind the roll-out of the award winning Coinbase/Visa card. In most cases it would take years of significant investment for others to match Paysafe’s level of monitoring, risk management and underwriting. It’s often easier for a ""competitor"" to just give them a cut of the take. CEO McHugh notes, “That’s where we get broader and deeper take rates over time. We process with Worldpay and have a capability with Fiserv as well, so we do multi-processor there.” And Danny Chazonoff, COO, adds, “In Europe, we are the acquirer of record, so we have a principal membership with Visa and MasterCard. What that brings for us is the ability to do our own underwriting without any intervention at all from an acquiring bank.” Rather than competing directly with other payment processors, Paysafe's angle is to quietly work with everyone. This is partly why Bill Foley describes Paysafe as “ubiquitous. It’s just everywhere.” Having cited a potential $58 trillion total addressable market, rather than competing in the general retail space, they focus on drilling down in “hard to do, hard to copy” niche verticals. CEO McHugh: “That’s why we like the deep verticals as opposed to trying to go head to head in the more general retail space which is more susceptible to scale economics.” Through its emerging Unity Platform, Paysafe is also differentiating itself with a single cloud-based payment gateway that synthesizes a large suite of interconnected products and payment rails: credit and debit card processing integrated eCommerce processing online banking with real-time bank payments ACH check transactions digital wallets with real-time pay-in/pay-out functionality person to person payments in 40 currencies eCash solutions to digitize cash reaching a massive underbanked consumer base 38 [digital] currencies in over 90 markets trading in the wallet international money transfers branded gift card management recurring billing data mining for targeted direct marketing travel safeguarding for most major airlines tokenization and encryption (NFTs) in-store brick-and-mortar frictionless checkout (with competitive scalable pricing for a wider range of business sizes) As the CEO points out, “Merchants just want sales regardless of payment method…There are very few competitors that can compete with us across all of the products…we continue to see the combination of our eCommerce gateway, digital wallets, online banking, and eCash solutions as a true differentiator in the market…The company that can synthesize that onto one platform will do very well."" Reviews: While on the topic of competition, Bears who apparently aren’t aware of Paysafe’s award winning consumer products like Paysafecard and Skrill, often point to an odd Trustpilot 1.9/5 star rating of nondescript “Paysafe” with only 287 reviews. Meanwhile, they ignore Trustpilot ratings of Paysafe’s actual consumer-facing products like: Paysafecard: “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) 43K reviews Skrill: “great” (4/5 stars) 19K reviews Skrill Money Transfer: “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) 9K reviews By contrast, Trustpilot rates competitors: PayPal: “bad"" (1.2/5 stars) 20K reviews Stripe: “Average” (3.3/5 stars) 6.6K reviews Cash App: “bad” (1.2/5 stars) 3K reviews Zelle: “bad” (1.1/5 stars) 398 reviews Venmo: “bad” (1.3/5 stars) 281 reviews Note: This is not to bash competitors, but to point out how the bear argument is essentially meaningless.

Blackstone Group Many have blamed PSFE’s price decline on insider selling by pointing to Blackstone Group’s most recent 13F filings indicating a 23% reduction of their position. However, cross-referencing that 13F and the most recent SEC filing with Paysafe’s March 31 20F (p.124) shows that Blackstone holds the exact same number of shares as they did at the time of merger: 123.7 million shares. It’s true, private equity lockups expired months ago and the 13F appears to show a sale of 37 million shares between Q1 and Q2. BUT, to believe that they sold those shares then you’d also have to believe that they BOUGHT 37 million shares (a half billion dollar stake) in Q1, PRIOR to their payout from merger, and then immediately turned around and sold that exact same amount of shares for a SIGNIFICANT loss, just after merger. Seems like quite a stretch. When asked directly about Blackstone’s 13F and whether they’d sold shares, Paysafe’s investor relations responded, ""That swing in the 13F position was an issue with the 13F filing, but I see how that was confusing.

When taking Paysafe private, Blackstone/CVC paid “a 42% premium over the group's average value over the past year,” because, as Reuter’s reported, insiders close to the deal said private equity had “a decade-long thesis that the shift to [digital payments] will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.” This “decade-long” thesis matches Blackstone’s typical investment term of “upwards of 7-10 years” according to their published white paper. 7 to 10 years would be 2024-2027, which lines up with the FTAC board investment thesis, as outlined in their proxy statement when approving the business combination (see #9). More recently, Reuters reported: “Martin Brand, senior managing director at Blackstone, said in an interview that retaining the majority of its investment would allow the buyout firm to benefit from the expected strong performance that Paysafe will generate going forward.” Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler said, “We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.” And last month, CEO Philip McHugh assured: “You won’t see Blackstone and CVC going out there and doing big block sales any time soon. They see our story. They see the pipeline. They see the kind of top of funnel pipeline at the company where we’re gaining traction not only in US iGaming but in [digital currency], in travel and online gaming.” 6. Insider Ownership Bears have argued that lack of insider ownership is a red flag but on top of the large stake held by board members, Blackstone and CVC, Paysafe’s share registration confirms this argument is another non-starter: CEO Philip McHugh owns 2.4m shares COO Danny Chazonoff owns 2.2m shares Vice Chairman Joel Leonoff owns 8.3m shares Chairman of the Board Bill Foley owns 42m shares 3 Employee Trusts own 2.3m shares 7. Competition Bears like to claim that a large competitor will eat Paysafe’s lunch, but it’s hard to ignore the fact that Paysafe is the one now encroaching on the North American market. Along with expanding in iGaming, they’re initiating their US launch of digital wallets Skrill and Neteller, with higher limits and real-time pay-in/pay-out, which they say “fills a gap in the U.S. market.” Some theorize that Paysafe’s competitive threat is the reason it’s being shorted, so as to inhibit the company’s ability to raise capital for further acquisitions, or to prime them for a buyout. But the company has leverage to spare and, when asked directly about a buyout, the CEO was very clear that they are not interested. Speculation aside, bears who claim Paysafe will lose to competitors generally ignore how large, established, specialized and diversified Paysafe is in the global marketplace. With its focus on niche verticals, Paysafe is the undisputed leader in iGaming; it owns the second largest digital wallet in the world; it is #4 globally in integrated payment processing; it does over $100 billion in volume; it is used in 120 countries, and it is so good at multi-jurisdictional regulatory monitoring and risk management that other payment processors often use them as a middle man for transactions. This last point is a key differentiator for Paysafe. CEO McHugh: “Because it’s complicated, the risk and regulatory management in payments and gaming at a global scale is not something that’s easy to copy.” He further notes, “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem.” Paysafe’s regulatory expertise enables them to innovate and enhance their moat with new risk-management solutions in different industries like their recently developed travel safeguarding model. It’s also a major reason why most iGaming operators use Paysafe’s award winning platform (which, like any good pick and shovel play, makes them immune to the lack of brand loyalty among sports bettors who tend to migrate between iGaming operators). Often embedded behind the scenes so that customers don’t know they are using it, Paysafe offers a trusted payment gateway that so effectively mitigates transaction liability that it is commonly used as a hidden partner. They work with MasterCard, Visa, Fiserv, WorldPay(US DraftKings), Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, Sightline, REPAY, Intellipay, and a host of others. Paysafe is also behind the roll-out of the award winning Coinbase/Visa card. In most cases it would take years of significant investment for others to match Paysafe’s level of monitoring, risk management and underwriting. It’s often easier for a ""competitor"" to just give them a cut of the take. CEO McHugh notes, “That’s where we get broader and deeper take rates over time. We process with Worldpay and have a capability with Fiserv as well, so we do multi-processor there.” And Danny Chazonoff, COO, adds, “In Europe, we are the acquirer of record, so we have a principal membership with Visa and MasterCard. What that brings for us is the ability to do our own underwriting without any intervention at all from an acquiring bank.” Rather than competing directly with other payment processors, Paysafe's angle is to quietly work with everyone. This is partly why Bill Foley describes Paysafe as “ubiquitous. It’s just everywhere.” Having cited a potential $58 trillion total addressable market, rather than competing in the general retail space, they focus on drilling down in “hard to do, hard to copy” niche verticals. CEO McHugh: “That’s why we like the deep verticals as opposed to trying to go head to head in the more general retail space which is more susceptible to scale economics.” Through its emerging Unity Platform, Paysafe is also differentiating itself with a single cloud-based payment gateway that synthesizes a large suite of interconnected products and payment rails: credit and debit card processing integrated eCommerce processing online banking with real-time bank payments ACH check transactions digital wallets with real-time pay-in/pay-out functionality person to person payments in 40 currencies eCash solutions to digitize cash reaching a massive underbanked consumer base 38 [digital] currencies in over 90 markets trading in the wallet international money transfers branded gift card management recurring billing data mining for targeted direct marketing travel safeguarding for most major airlines tokenization and encryption (NFTs) in-store brick-and-mortar frictionless checkout (with competitive scalable pricing for a wider range of business sizes) As the CEO points out, “Merchants just want sales regardless of payment method…There are very few competitors that can compete with us across all of the products…we continue to see the combination of our eCommerce gateway, digital wallets, online banking, and eCash solutions as a true differentiator in the market…The company that can synthesize that onto one platform will do very well."" Reviews: While on the topic of competition, Bears who apparently aren’t aware of Paysafe’s award winning consumer products like Paysafecard and Skrill, often point to an odd Trustpilot 1.9/5 star rating of nondescript “Paysafe” with only 287 reviews. Meanwhile, they ignore Trustpilot ratings of Paysafe’s actual consumer-facing products like: Paysafecard: “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) 43K reviews Skrill: “great” (4/5 stars) 19K reviews Skrill Money Transfer: “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) 9K reviews By contrast, Trustpilot rates competitors: PayPal: “bad"" (1.2/5 stars) 20K reviews Stripe: “Average” (3.3/5 stars) 6.6K reviews Cash App: “bad” (1.2/5 stars) 3K reviews Zelle: “bad” (1.1/5 stars) 398 reviews Venmo: “bad” (1.3/5 stars) 281 reviews Note: This is not to bash competitors, but to point out how the bear argument is essentially meaningless.

I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 5. Blackstone Group Many have blamed PSFE’s price decline on insider selling by pointing to Blackstone Group’s most recent 13F filings indicating a 23% reduction of their position. However, cross-referencing that 13F and the most recent SEC filing with Paysafe’s March 31 20F (p.124) shows that Blackstone holds the exact same number of shares as they did at the time of merger: 123.7 million shares. It’s true, private equity lockups expired months ago and the 13F appears to show a sale of 37 million shares between Q1 and Q2. BUT, to believe that they sold those shares then you’d also have to believe that they BOUGHT 37 million shares (a half billion dollar stake) in Q1, PRIOR to their payout from merger, and then immediately turned around and sold that exact same amount of shares for a SIGNIFICANT loss, just after merger. Seems like quite a stretch. When asked directly about Blackstone’s 13F and whether they’d sold shares, Paysafe’s investor relations responded, ""That swing in the 13F position was an issue with the 13F filing, but I see how that was confusing.  It was not reflective of any actual open market selling of Paysafe stock."" Make of it what you will, but there’s no denying that the most recent records show that Blackstone still holds the same number of shares as they did per the original deal structure. The same is true of CVC. Other factors to consider about Blackstone’s stake: Bears commonly claim Paysafe is overvalued because private equity made 3x on this investment. They reach this conclusion by ignoring the difference between market cap and enterprise value and by assuming PE was somehow awarded a full $9 billion from a $3 billion investment. In truth, as Reuters reported, Paysafe, “was taken private by Blackstone Group Inc and CVC Capital Partners in 2017 for $4.7 billion, inclusive of debt.” At the time of the 2021 merger, Blackstone/CVC received $2.3 billion in cash and $2.8 billion in shares. (280 million shares now worth $2.2b). At current levels, that’s a total of $4.5 billion in cash and shares. So, from their initial $3.9 billion USD (£2.96b) investment, Blackstone and CVC are currently up a mere 15%, between cash and shares. That’s after 4 years of significant strategic investment in restructuring, de-risking, replacing the Board of Directors and bringing in all new leadership (CEO, CFO, CTO, CRO, CIO, CISO etc.).

Insider Ownership Bears have argued that lack of insider ownership is a red flag but on top of the large stake held by board members, Blackstone and CVC, Paysafe’s share registration confirms this argument is another non-starter: CEO Philip McHugh owns 2.4m shares COO Danny Chazonoff owns 2.2m shares Vice Chairman Joel Leonoff owns 8.3m shares Chairman of the Board Bill Foley owns 42m shares 3 Employee Trusts own 2.3m shares 7. Competition Bears like to claim that a large competitor will eat Paysafe’s lunch, but it’s hard to ignore the fact that Paysafe is the one now encroaching on the North American market. Along with expanding in iGaming, they’re initiating their US launch of digital wallets Skrill and Neteller, with higher limits and real-time pay-in/pay-out, which they say “fills a gap in the U.S. market.” Some theorize that Paysafe’s competitive threat is the reason it’s being shorted, so as to inhibit the company’s ability to raise capital for further acquisitions, or to prime them for a buyout. But the company has leverage to spare and, when asked directly about a buyout, the CEO was very clear that they are not interested. Speculation aside, bears who claim Paysafe will lose to competitors generally ignore how large, established, specialized and diversified Paysafe is in the global marketplace. With its focus on niche verticals, Paysafe is the undisputed leader in iGaming; it owns the second largest digital wallet in the world; it is #4 globally in integrated payment processing; it does over $100 billion in volume; it is used in 120 countries, and it is so good at multi-jurisdictional regulatory monitoring and risk management that other payment processors often use them as a middle man for transactions. This last point is a key differentiator for Paysafe. CEO McHugh: “Because it’s complicated, the risk and regulatory management in payments and gaming at a global scale is not something that’s easy to copy.” He further notes, “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem.” Paysafe’s regulatory expertise enables them to innovate and enhance their moat with new risk-management solutions in different industries like their recently developed travel safeguarding model. It’s also a major reason why most iGaming operators use Paysafe’s award winning platform (which, like any good pick and shovel play, makes them immune to the lack of brand loyalty among sports bettors who tend to migrate between iGaming operators). Often embedded behind the scenes so that customers don’t know they are using it, Paysafe offers a trusted payment gateway that so effectively mitigates transaction liability that it is commonly used as a hidden partner. They work with MasterCard, Visa, Fiserv, WorldPay(US DraftKings), Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, Sightline, REPAY, Intellipay, and a host of others. Paysafe is also behind the roll-out of the award winning Coinbase/Visa card. In most cases it would take years of significant investment for others to match Paysafe’s level of monitoring, risk management and underwriting. It’s often easier for a ""competitor"" to just give them a cut of the take. CEO McHugh notes, “That’s where we get broader and deeper take rates over time. We process with Worldpay and have a capability with Fiserv as well, so we do multi-processor there.” And Danny Chazonoff, COO, adds, “In Europe, we are the acquirer of record, so we have a principal membership with Visa and MasterCard. What that brings for us is the ability to do our own underwriting without any intervention at all from an acquiring bank.” Rather than competing directly with other payment processors, Paysafe's angle is to quietly work with everyone. This is partly why Bill Foley describes Paysafe as “ubiquitous. It’s just everywhere.” Having cited a potential $58 trillion total addressable market, rather than competing in the general retail space, they focus on drilling down in “hard to do, hard to copy” niche verticals. CEO McHugh: “That’s why we like the deep verticals as opposed to trying to go head to head in the more general retail space which is more susceptible to scale economics.” Through its emerging Unity Platform, Paysafe is also differentiating itself with a single cloud-based payment gateway that synthesizes a large suite of interconnected products and payment rails: credit and debit card processing integrated eCommerce processing online banking with real-time bank payments ACH check transactions digital wallets with real-time pay-in/pay-out functionality person to person payments in 40 currencies eCash solutions to digitize cash reaching a massive underbanked consumer base 38 [digital] currencies in over 90 markets trading in the wallet international money transfers branded gift card management recurring billing data mining for targeted direct marketing travel safeguarding for most major airlines tokenization and encryption (NFTs) in-store brick-and-mortar frictionless checkout (with competitive scalable pricing for a wider range of business sizes) As the CEO points out, “Merchants just want sales regardless of payment method…There are very few competitors that can compete with us across all of the products…we continue to see the combination of our eCommerce gateway, digital wallets, online banking, and eCash solutions as a true differentiator in the market…The company that can synthesize that onto one platform will do very well."" Reviews: While on the topic of competition, Bears who apparently aren’t aware of Paysafe’s award winning consumer products like Paysafecard and Skrill, often point to an odd Trustpilot 1.9/5 star rating of nondescript “Paysafe” with only 287 reviews. Meanwhile, they ignore Trustpilot ratings of Paysafe’s actual consumer-facing products like: Paysafecard: “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) 43K reviews Skrill: “great” (4/5 stars) 19K reviews Skrill Money Transfer: “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) 9K reviews By contrast, Trustpilot rates competitors: PayPal: “bad"" (1.2/5 stars) 20K reviews Stripe: “Average” (3.3/5 stars) 6.6K reviews Cash App: “bad” (1.2/5 stars) 3K reviews Zelle: “bad” (1.1/5 stars) 398 reviews Venmo: “bad” (1.3/5 stars) 281 reviews Note: This is not to bash competitors, but to point out how the bear argument is essentially meaningless.

,"Here are Parts 5 - 7 of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1- 4 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit as well as available float. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 5. Blackstone Group Many have blamed PSFE’s price decline on insider selling by pointing to Blackstone Group’s most recent 13F filings indicating a 23% reduction of their position. However, cross-referencing that 13F and the most recent SEC filing with Paysafe’s March 31 20F (p.124) shows that Blackstone holds the exact same number of shares as they did at the time of merger: 123.7 million shares. It’s true, private equity lockups expired months ago and the 13F appears to show a sale of 37 million shares between Q1 and Q2. BUT, to believe that they sold those shares then you’d also have to believe that they BOUGHT 37 million shares (a half billion dollar stake) in Q1, PRIOR to their payout from merger, and then immediately turned around and sold that exact same amount of shares for a SIGNIFICANT loss, just after merger. Seems like quite a stretch. When asked directly about Blackstone’s 13F and whether they’d sold shares, Paysafe’s investor relations responded, ""That swing in the 13F position was an issue with the 13F filing, but I see how that was confusing.  It was not reflective of any actual open market selling of Paysafe stock."" Make of it what you will, but there’s no denying that the most recent records show that Blackstone still holds the same number of shares as they did per the original deal structure. The same is true of CVC. Other factors to consider about Blackstone’s stake: Bears commonly claim Paysafe is overvalued because private equity made 3x on this investment. They reach this conclusion by ignoring the difference between market cap and enterprise value and by assuming PE was somehow awarded a full $9 billion from a $3 billion investment. In truth, as Reuters reported, Paysafe, “was taken private by Blackstone Group Inc and CVC Capital Partners in 2017 for $4.7 billion, inclusive of debt.” At the time of the 2021 merger, Blackstone/CVC received $2.3 billion in cash and $2.8 billion in shares. (280 million shares now worth $2.2b). At current levels, that’s a total of $4.5 billion in cash and shares. So, from their initial $3.9 billion USD (£2.96b) investment, Blackstone and CVC are currently up a mere 15%, between cash and shares. That’s after 4 years of significant strategic investment in restructuring, de-risking, replacing the Board of Directors and bringing in all new leadership (CEO, CFO, CTO, CRO, CIO, CISO etc.). This is part of a long term strategy. When taking Paysafe private, Blackstone/CVC paid “a 42% premium over the group's average value over the past year,” because, as Reuter’s reported, insiders close to the deal said private equity had “a decade-long thesis that the shift to [digital payments] will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.” This “decade-long” thesis matches Blackstone’s typical investment term of “upwards of 7-10 years” according to their published white paper. 7 to 10 years would be 2024-2027, which lines up with the FTAC board investment thesis, as outlined in their proxy statement when approving the business combination (see #9). More recently, Reuters reported: “Martin Brand, senior managing director at Blackstone, said in an interview that retaining the majority of its investment would allow the buyout firm to benefit from the expected strong performance that Paysafe will generate going forward.” Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler said, “We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.” And last month, CEO Philip McHugh assured: “You won’t see Blackstone and CVC going out there and doing big block sales any time soon. They see our story. They see the pipeline. They see the kind of top of funnel pipeline at the company where we’re gaining traction not only in US iGaming but in [digital currency], in travel and online gaming.” 6.

With its focus on niche verticals, Paysafe is the undisputed leader in iGaming; it owns the second largest digital wallet in the world; it is #4 globally in integrated payment processing; it does over $100 billion in volume; it is used in 120 countries, and it is so good at multi-jurisdictional regulatory monitoring and risk management that other payment processors often use them as a middle man for transactions. This last point is a key differentiator for Paysafe. CEO McHugh: “Because it’s complicated, the risk and regulatory management in payments and gaming at a global scale is not something that’s easy to copy.” He further notes, “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem.” Paysafe’s regulatory expertise enables them to innovate and enhance their moat with new risk-management solutions in different industries like their recently developed travel safeguarding model. It’s also a major reason why most iGaming operators use Paysafe’s award winning platform (which, like any good pick and shovel play, makes them immune to the lack of brand loyalty among sports bettors who tend to migrate between iGaming operators). Often embedded behind the scenes so that customers don’t know they are using it, Paysafe offers a trusted payment gateway that so effectively mitigates transaction liability that it is commonly used as a hidden partner. They work with MasterCard, Visa, Fiserv, WorldPay(US DraftKings), Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, Sightline, REPAY, Intellipay, and a host of others. Paysafe is also behind the roll-out of the award winning Coinbase/Visa card. In most cases it would take years of significant investment for others to match Paysafe’s level of monitoring, risk management and underwriting. It’s often easier for a ""competitor"" to just give them a cut of the take. CEO McHugh notes, “That’s where we get broader and deeper take rates over time. We process with Worldpay and have a capability with Fiserv as well, so we do multi-processor there.” And Danny Chazonoff, COO, adds, “In Europe, we are the acquirer of record, so we have a principal membership with Visa and MasterCard. What that brings for us is the ability to do our own underwriting without any intervention at all from an acquiring bank.” Rather than competing directly with other payment processors, Paysafe's angle is to quietly work with everyone. This is partly why Bill Foley describes Paysafe as “ubiquitous. It’s just everywhere.” Having cited a potential $58 trillion total addressable market, rather than competing in the general retail space, they focus on drilling down in “hard to do, hard to copy” niche verticals. CEO McHugh: “That’s why we like the deep verticals as opposed to trying to go head to head in the more general retail space which is more susceptible to scale economics.” Through its emerging Unity Platform, Paysafe is also differentiating itself with a single cloud-based payment gateway that synthesizes a large suite of interconnected products and payment rails: credit and debit card processing integrated eCommerce processing online banking with real-time bank payments ACH check transactions digital wallets with real-time pay-in/pay-out functionality person to person payments in 40 currencies eCash solutions to digitize cash reaching a massive underbanked consumer base 38 [digital] currencies in over 90 markets trading in the wallet international money transfers branded gift card management recurring billing data mining for targeted direct marketing travel safeguarding for most major airlines tokenization and encryption (NFTs) in-store brick-and-mortar frictionless checkout (with competitive scalable pricing for a wider range of business sizes) As the CEO points out, “Merchants just want sales regardless of payment method…There are very few competitors that can compete with us across all of the products…we continue to see the combination of our eCommerce gateway, digital wallets, online banking, and eCash solutions as a true differentiator in the market…The company that can synthesize that onto one platform will do very well.""

,"Here are Parts 5 - 7 of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1- 4 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit as well as available float. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 5. Blackstone Group Many have blamed PSFE’s price decline on insider selling by pointing to Blackstone Group’s most recent 13F filings indicating a 23% reduction of their position. However, cross-referencing that 13F and the most recent SEC filing with Paysafe’s March 31 20F (p.124) shows that Blackstone holds the exact same number of shares as they did at the time of merger: 123.7 million shares. It’s true, private equity lockups expired months ago and the 13F appears to show a sale of 37 million shares between Q1 and Q2. BUT, to believe that they sold those shares then you’d also have to believe that they BOUGHT 37 million shares (a half billion dollar stake) in Q1, PRIOR to their payout from merger, and then immediately turned around and sold that exact same amount of shares for a SIGNIFICANT loss, just after merger. Seems like quite a stretch. When asked directly about Blackstone’s 13F and whether they’d sold shares, Paysafe’s investor relations responded, ""That swing in the 13F position was an issue with the 13F filing, but I see how that was confusing.  It was not reflective of any actual open market selling of Paysafe stock."" Make of it what you will, but there’s no denying that the most recent records show that Blackstone still holds the same number of shares as they did per the original deal structure. The same is true of CVC. Other factors to consider about Blackstone’s stake: Bears commonly claim Paysafe is overvalued because private equity made 3x on this investment. They reach this conclusion by ignoring the difference between market cap and enterprise value and by assuming PE was somehow awarded a full $9 billion from a $3 billion investment. In truth, as Reuters reported, Paysafe, “was taken private by Blackstone Group Inc and CVC Capital Partners in 2017 for $4.7 billion, inclusive of debt.” At the time of the 2021 merger, Blackstone/CVC received $2.3 billion in cash and $2.8 billion in shares. (280 million shares now worth $2.2b). At current levels, that’s a total of $4.5 billion in cash and shares. So, from their initial $3.9 billion USD (£2.96b) investment, Blackstone and CVC are currently up a mere 15%, between cash and shares. That’s after 4 years of significant strategic investment in restructuring, de-risking, replacing the Board of Directors and bringing in all new leadership (CEO, CFO, CTO, CRO, CIO, CISO etc.). This is part of a long term strategy. When taking Paysafe private, Blackstone/CVC paid “a 42% premium over the group's average value over the past year,” because, as Reuter’s reported, insiders close to the deal said private equity had “a decade-long thesis that the shift to [digital payments] will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.” This “decade-long” thesis matches Blackstone’s typical investment term of “upwards of 7-10 years” according to their published white paper. 7 to 10 years would be 2024-2027, which lines up with the FTAC board investment thesis, as outlined in their proxy statement when approving the business combination (see #9). More recently, Reuters reported: “Martin Brand, senior managing director at Blackstone, said in an interview that retaining the majority of its investment would allow the buyout firm to benefit from the expected strong performance that Paysafe will generate going forward.” Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler said, “We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.” And last month, CEO Philip McHugh assured: “You won’t see Blackstone and CVC going out there and doing big block sales any time soon. They see our story. They see the pipeline. They see the kind of top of funnel pipeline at the company where we’re gaining traction not only in US iGaming but in [digital currency], in travel and online gaming.” 6. Insider Ownership Bears have argued that lack of insider ownership is a red flag but on top of the large stake held by board members, Blackstone and CVC, Paysafe’s share registration confirms this argument is another non-starter: CEO Philip McHugh owns 2.4m shares COO Danny Chazonoff owns 2.2m shares Vice Chairman Joel Leonoff owns 8.3m shares Chairman of the Board Bill Foley owns 42m shares 3 Employee Trusts own 2.3m shares 7. Competition Bears like to claim that a large competitor will eat Paysafe’s lunch, but it’s hard to ignore the fact that Paysafe is the one now encroaching on the North American market. Along with expanding in iGaming, they’re initiating their US launch of digital wallets Skrill and Neteller, with higher limits and real-time pay-in/pay-out, which they say “fills a gap in the U.S. market.” Some theorize that Paysafe’s competitive threat is the reason it’s being shorted, so as to inhibit the company’s ability to raise capital for further acquisitions, or to prime them for a buyout. But the company has leverage to spare and, when asked directly about a buyout, the CEO was very clear that they are not interested.

Paysafe is also behind the roll-out of the award winning Coinbase/Visa card. In most cases it would take years of significant investment for others to match Paysafe’s level of monitoring, risk management and underwriting. It’s often easier for a ""competitor"" to just give them a cut of the take. CEO McHugh notes, “That’s where we get broader and deeper take rates over time. We process with Worldpay and have a capability with Fiserv as well, so we do multi-processor there.” And Danny Chazonoff, COO, adds, “In Europe, we are the acquirer of record, so we have a principal membership with Visa and MasterCard. What that brings for us is the ability to do our own underwriting without any intervention at all from an acquiring bank.” Rather than competing directly with other payment processors, Paysafe's angle is to quietly work with everyone. This is partly why Bill Foley describes Paysafe as “ubiquitous. It’s just everywhere.” Having cited a potential $58 trillion total addressable market, rather than competing in the general retail space, they focus on drilling down in “hard to do, hard to copy” niche verticals. CEO McHugh: “That’s why we like the deep verticals as opposed to trying to go head to head in the more general retail space which is more susceptible to scale economics.” Through its emerging Unity Platform, Paysafe is also differentiating itself with a single cloud-based payment gateway that synthesizes a large suite of interconnected products and payment rails: credit and debit card processing integrated eCommerce processing online banking with real-time bank payments ACH check transactions digital wallets with real-time pay-in/pay-out functionality person to person payments in 40 currencies eCash solutions to digitize cash reaching a massive underbanked consumer base 38 [digital] currencies in over 90 markets trading in the wallet international money transfers branded gift card management recurring billing data mining for targeted direct marketing travel safeguarding for most major airlines tokenization and encryption (NFTs) in-store brick-and-mortar frictionless checkout (with competitive scalable pricing for a wider range of business sizes) As the CEO points out, “Merchants just want sales regardless of payment method…There are very few competitors that can compete with us across all of the products…we continue to see the combination of our eCommerce gateway, digital wallets, online banking, and eCash solutions as a true differentiator in the market…The company that can synthesize that onto one platform will do very well."" Reviews: While on the topic of competition, Bears who apparently aren’t aware of Paysafe’s award winning consumer products like Paysafecard and Skrill, often point to an odd Trustpilot 1.9/5 star rating of nondescript “Paysafe” with only 287 reviews. Meanwhile, they ignore Trustpilot ratings of Paysafe’s actual consumer-facing products like: Paysafecard: “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) 43K reviews Skrill: “great” (4/5 stars) 19K reviews Skrill Money Transfer: “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) 9K reviews By contrast, Trustpilot rates competitors: PayPal: “bad"" (1.2/5 stars) 20K reviews Stripe: “Average” (3.3/5 stars) 6.6K reviews Cash App: “bad” (1.2/5 stars) 3K reviews Zelle: “bad” (1.1/5 stars) 398 reviews Venmo: “bad” (1.3/5 stars) 281 reviews Note: This is not to bash competitors, but to point out how the bear argument is essentially meaningless.

I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 5. Blackstone Group Many have blamed PSFE’s price decline on insider selling by pointing to Blackstone Group’s most recent 13F filings indicating a 23% reduction of their position. However, cross-referencing that 13F and the most recent SEC filing with Paysafe’s March 31 20F (p.124) shows that Blackstone holds the exact same number of shares as they did at the time of merger: 123.7 million shares. It’s true, private equity lockups expired months ago and the 13F appears to show a sale of 37 million shares between Q1 and Q2. BUT, to believe that they sold those shares then you’d also have to believe that they BOUGHT 37 million shares (a half billion dollar stake) in Q1, PRIOR to their payout from merger, and then immediately turned around and sold that exact same amount of shares for a SIGNIFICANT loss, just after merger. Seems like quite a stretch. When asked directly about Blackstone’s 13F and whether they’d sold shares, Paysafe’s investor relations responded, ""That swing in the 13F position was an issue with the 13F filing, but I see how that was confusing.  It was not reflective of any actual open market selling of Paysafe stock."" Make of it what you will, but there’s no denying that the most recent records show that Blackstone still holds the same number of shares as they did per the original deal structure. The same is true of CVC. Other factors to consider about Blackstone’s stake: Bears commonly claim Paysafe is overvalued because private equity made 3x on this investment. They reach this conclusion by ignoring the difference between market cap and enterprise value and by assuming PE was somehow awarded a full $9 billion from a $3 billion investment. In truth, as Reuters reported, Paysafe, “was taken private by Blackstone Group Inc and CVC Capital Partners in 2017 for $4.7 billion, inclusive of debt.” At the time of the 2021 merger, Blackstone/CVC received $2.3 billion in cash and $2.8 billion in shares. (280 million shares now worth $2.2b). At current levels, that’s a total of $4.5 billion in cash and shares. So, from their initial $3.9 billion USD (£2.96b) investment, Blackstone and CVC are currently up a mere 15%, between cash and shares. That’s after 4 years of significant strategic investment in restructuring, de-risking, replacing the Board of Directors and bringing in all new leadership (CEO, CFO, CTO, CRO, CIO, CISO etc.). This is part of a long term strategy. When taking Paysafe private, Blackstone/CVC paid “a 42% premium over the group's average value over the past year,” because, as Reuter’s reported, insiders close to the deal said private equity had “a decade-long thesis that the shift to [digital payments] will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.” This “decade-long” thesis matches Blackstone’s typical investment term of “upwards of 7-10 years” according to their published white paper. 7 to 10 years would be 2024-2027, which lines up with the FTAC board investment thesis, as outlined in their proxy statement when approving the business combination (see #9). More recently, Reuters reported: “Martin Brand, senior managing director at Blackstone, said in an interview that retaining the majority of its investment would allow the buyout firm to benefit from the expected strong performance that Paysafe will generate going forward.” Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler said, “We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.” And last month, CEO Philip McHugh assured: “You won’t see Blackstone and CVC going out there and doing big block sales any time soon. They see our story. They see the pipeline. They see the kind of top of funnel pipeline at the company where we’re gaining traction not only in US iGaming but in [digital currency], in travel and online gaming.” 6. Insider Ownership Bears have argued that lack of insider ownership is a red flag but on top of the large stake held by board members, Blackstone and CVC, Paysafe’s share registration confirms this argument is another non-starter: CEO Philip McHugh owns 2.4m shares COO Danny Chazonoff owns 2.2m shares Vice Chairman Joel Leonoff owns 8.3m shares Chairman of the Board Bill Foley owns 42m shares 3 Employee Trusts own 2.3m shares 7. Competition Bears like to claim that a large competitor will eat Paysafe’s lunch, but it’s hard to ignore the fact that Paysafe is the one now encroaching on the North American market. Along with expanding in iGaming, they’re initiating their US launch of digital wallets Skrill and Neteller, with higher limits and real-time pay-in/pay-out, which they say “fills a gap in the U.S. market.” Some theorize that Paysafe’s competitive threat is the reason it’s being shorted, so as to inhibit the company’s ability to raise capital for further acquisitions, or to prime them for a buyout. But the company has leverage to spare and, when asked directly about a buyout, the CEO was very clear that they are not interested. Speculation aside, bears who claim Paysafe will lose to competitors generally ignore how large, established, specialized and diversified Paysafe is in the global marketplace. With its focus on niche verticals, Paysafe is the undisputed leader in iGaming; it owns the second largest digital wallet in the world; it is #4 globally in integrated payment processing; it does over $100 billion in volume; it is used in 120 countries, and it is so good at multi-jurisdictional regulatory monitoring and risk management that other payment processors often use them as a middle man for transactions. This last point is a key differentiator for Paysafe. CEO McHugh: “Because it’s complicated, the risk and regulatory management in payments and gaming at a global scale is not something that’s easy to copy.” He further notes, “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem.” Paysafe’s regulatory expertise enables them to innovate and enhance their moat with new risk-management solutions in different industries like their recently developed travel safeguarding model. It’s also a major reason why most iGaming operators use Paysafe’s award winning platform (which, like any good pick and shovel play, makes them immune to the lack of brand loyalty among sports bettors who tend to migrate between iGaming operators). Often embedded behind the scenes so that customers don’t know they are using it, Paysafe offers a trusted payment gateway that so effectively mitigates transaction liability that it is commonly used as a hidden partner.

What that brings for us is the ability to do our own underwriting without any intervention at all from an acquiring bank.” Rather than competing directly with other payment processors, Paysafe's angle is to quietly work with everyone. This is partly why Bill Foley describes Paysafe as “ubiquitous. It’s just everywhere.” Having cited a potential $58 trillion total addressable market, rather than competing in the general retail space, they focus on drilling down in “hard to do, hard to copy” niche verticals. CEO McHugh: “That’s why we like the deep verticals as opposed to trying to go head to head in the more general retail space which is more susceptible to scale economics.” Through its emerging Unity Platform, Paysafe is also differentiating itself with a single cloud-based payment gateway that synthesizes a large suite of interconnected products and payment rails: credit and debit card processing integrated eCommerce processing online banking with real-time bank payments ACH check transactions digital wallets with real-time pay-in/pay-out functionality person to person payments in 40 currencies eCash solutions to digitize cash reaching a massive underbanked consumer base 38 [digital] currencies in over 90 markets trading in the wallet international money transfers branded gift card management recurring billing data mining for targeted direct marketing travel safeguarding for most major airlines tokenization and encryption (NFTs) in-store brick-and-mortar frictionless checkout (with competitive scalable pricing for a wider range of business sizes) As the CEO points out, “Merchants just want sales regardless of payment method…There are very few competitors that can compete with us across all of the products…we continue to see the combination of our eCommerce gateway, digital wallets, online banking, and eCash solutions as a true differentiator in the market…The company that can synthesize that onto one platform will do very well."" Reviews: While on the topic of competition, Bears who apparently aren’t aware of Paysafe’s award winning consumer products like Paysafecard and Skrill, often point to an odd Trustpilot 1.9/5 star rating of nondescript “Paysafe” with only 287 reviews. Meanwhile, they ignore Trustpilot ratings of Paysafe’s actual consumer-facing products like: Paysafecard: “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) 43K reviews Skrill: “great” (4/5 stars) 19K reviews Skrill Money Transfer: “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) 9K reviews By contrast, Trustpilot rates competitors: PayPal: “bad"" (1.2/5 stars) 20K reviews Stripe: “Average” (3.3/5 stars) 6.6K reviews Cash App: “bad” (1.2/5 stars) 3K reviews Zelle: “bad” (1.1/5 stars) 398 reviews Venmo: “bad” (1.3/5 stars) 281 reviews Note: This is not to bash competitors, but to point out how the bear argument is essentially meaningless.

,"Here are Parts 5 - 7 of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1- 4 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit as well as available float. I recommend starting with the introduction in Part 1 (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested. 5. Blackstone Group Many have blamed PSFE’s price decline on insider selling by pointing to Blackstone Group’s most recent 13F filings indicating a 23% reduction of their position. However, cross-referencing that 13F and the most recent SEC filing with Paysafe’s March 31 20F (p.124) shows that Blackstone holds the exact same number of shares as they did at the time of merger: 123.7 million shares. It’s true, private equity lockups expired months ago and the 13F appears to show a sale of 37 million shares between Q1 and Q2. BUT, to believe that they sold those shares then you’d also have to believe that they BOUGHT 37 million shares (a half billion dollar stake) in Q1, PRIOR to their payout from merger, and then immediately turned around and sold that exact same amount of shares for a SIGNIFICANT loss, just after merger. Seems like quite a stretch. When asked directly about Blackstone’s 13F and whether they’d sold shares, Paysafe’s investor relations responded, ""That swing in the 13F position was an issue with the 13F filing, but I see how that was confusing.  It was not reflective of any actual open market selling of Paysafe stock."" Make of it what you will, but there’s no denying that the most recent records show that Blackstone still holds the same number of shares as they did per the original deal structure. The same is true of CVC. Other factors to consider about Blackstone’s stake: Bears commonly claim Paysafe is overvalued because private equity made 3x on this investment. They reach this conclusion by ignoring the difference between market cap and enterprise value and by assuming PE was somehow awarded a full $9 billion from a $3 billion investment. In truth, as Reuters reported, Paysafe, “was taken private by Blackstone Group Inc and CVC Capital Partners in 2017 for $4.7 billion, inclusive of debt.” At the time of the 2021 merger, Blackstone/CVC received $2.3 billion in cash and $2.8 billion in shares. (280 million shares now worth $2.2b). At current levels, that’s a total of $4.5 billion in cash and shares. So, from their initial $3.9 billion USD (£2.96b) investment, Blackstone and CVC are currently up a mere 15%, between cash and shares. That’s after 4 years of significant strategic investment in restructuring, de-risking, replacing the Board of Directors and bringing in all new leadership (CEO, CFO, CTO, CRO, CIO, CISO etc.). This is part of a long term strategy. When taking Paysafe private, Blackstone/CVC paid “a 42% premium over the group's average value over the past year,” because, as Reuter’s reported, insiders close to the deal said private equity had “a decade-long thesis that the shift to [digital payments] will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.” This “decade-long” thesis matches Blackstone’s typical investment term of “upwards of 7-10 years” according to their published white paper. 7 to 10 years would be 2024-2027, which lines up with the FTAC board investment thesis, as outlined in their proxy statement when approving the business combination (see #9). More recently, Reuters reported: “Martin Brand, senior managing director at Blackstone, said in an interview that retaining the majority of its investment would allow the buyout firm to benefit from the expected strong performance that Paysafe will generate going forward.” Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler said, “We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.” And last month, CEO Philip McHugh assured: “You won’t see Blackstone and CVC going out there and doing big block sales any time soon. They see our story. They see the pipeline. They see the kind of top of funnel pipeline at the company where we’re gaining traction not only in US iGaming but in [digital currency], in travel and online gaming.” 6. Insider Ownership Bears have argued that lack of insider ownership is a red flag but on top of the large stake held by board members, Blackstone and CVC, Paysafe’s share registration confirms this argument is another non-starter: CEO Philip McHugh owns 2.4m shares COO Danny Chazonoff owns 2.2m shares Vice Chairman Joel Leonoff owns 8.3m shares Chairman of the Board Bill Foley owns 42m shares 3 Employee Trusts own 2.3m shares 7. Competition Bears like to claim that a large competitor will eat Paysafe’s lunch, but it’s hard to ignore the fact that Paysafe is the one now encroaching on the North American market. Along with expanding in iGaming, they’re initiating their US launch of digital wallets Skrill and Neteller, with higher limits and real-time pay-in/pay-out, which they say “fills a gap in the U.S. market.” Some theorize that Paysafe’s competitive threat is the reason it’s being shorted, so as to inhibit the company’s ability to raise capital for further acquisitions, or to prime them for a buyout. But the company has leverage to spare and, when asked directly about a buyout, the CEO was very clear that they are not interested. Speculation aside, bears who claim Paysafe will lose to competitors generally ignore how large, established, specialized and diversified Paysafe is in the global marketplace. With its focus on niche verticals, Paysafe is the undisputed leader in iGaming; it owns the second largest digital wallet in the world; it is #4 globally in integrated payment processing; it does over $100 billion in volume; it is used in 120 countries, and it is so good at multi-jurisdictional regulatory monitoring and risk management that other payment processors often use them as a middle man for transactions. This last point is a key differentiator for Paysafe. CEO McHugh: “Because it’s complicated, the risk and regulatory management in payments and gaming at a global scale is not something that’s easy to copy.” He further notes, “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem.” Paysafe’s regulatory expertise enables them to innovate and enhance their moat with new risk-management solutions in different industries like their recently developed travel safeguarding model. It’s also a major reason why most iGaming operators use Paysafe’s award winning platform (which, like any good pick and shovel play, makes them immune to the lack of brand loyalty among sports bettors who tend to migrate between iGaming operators). Often embedded behind the scenes so that customers don’t know they are using it, Paysafe offers a trusted payment gateway that so effectively mitigates transaction liability that it is commonly used as a hidden partner. They work with MasterCard, Visa, Fiserv, WorldPay(US DraftKings), Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, Sightline, REPAY, Intellipay, and a host of others. Paysafe is also behind the roll-out of the award winning Coinbase/Visa card. In most cases it would take years of significant investment for others to match Paysafe’s level of monitoring, risk management and underwriting. It’s often easier for a ""competitor"" to just give them a cut of the take. CEO McHugh notes, “That’s where we get broader and deeper take rates over time. We process with Worldpay and have a capability with Fiserv as well, so we do multi-processor there.” And Danny Chazonoff, COO, adds, “In Europe, we are the acquirer of record, so we have a principal membership with Visa and MasterCard.

CEO McHugh: “That’s why we like the deep verticals as opposed to trying to go head to head in the more general retail space which is more susceptible to scale economics.” Through its emerging Unity Platform, Paysafe is also differentiating itself with a single cloud-based payment gateway that synthesizes a large suite of interconnected products and payment rails: credit and debit card processing integrated eCommerce processing online banking with real-time bank payments ACH check transactions digital wallets with real-time pay-in/pay-out functionality person to person payments in 40 currencies eCash solutions to digitize cash reaching a massive underbanked consumer base 38 [digital] currencies in over 90 markets trading in the wallet international money transfers branded gift card management recurring billing data mining for targeted direct marketing travel safeguarding for most major airlines tokenization and encryption (NFTs) in-store brick-and-mortar frictionless checkout (with competitive scalable pricing for a wider range of business sizes) As the CEO points out, “Merchants just want sales regardless of payment method…There are very few competitors that can compete with us across all of the products…we continue to see the combination of our eCommerce gateway, digital wallets, online banking, and eCash solutions as a true differentiator in the market…The company that can synthesize that onto one platform will do very well."" Reviews: While on the topic of competition, Bears who apparently aren’t aware of Paysafe’s award winning consumer products like Paysafecard and Skrill, often point to an odd Trustpilot 1.9/5 star rating of nondescript “Paysafe” with only 287 reviews. Meanwhile, they ignore Trustpilot ratings of Paysafe’s actual consumer-facing products like: Paysafecard: “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) 43K reviews Skrill: “great” (4/5 stars) 19K reviews Skrill Money Transfer: “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) 9K reviews By contrast, Trustpilot rates competitors: PayPal: “bad"" (1.2/5 stars) 20K reviews Stripe: “Average” (3.3/5 stars) 6.6K reviews Cash App: “bad” (1.2/5 stars) 3K reviews Zelle: “bad” (1.1/5 stars) 398 reviews Venmo: “bad” (1.3/5 stars) 281 reviews Note: This is not to bash competitors, but to point out how the bear argument is essentially meaningless. To be fair, those competing platforms get much better Apple mobile app reviews but, even there, Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill gets a respectable, 4.4 out of 5 stars with 7.2K ratings. And at GooglePlay, their Paysafecard gets 4.3/5 stars with over 103K reviews. Continue to Parts 8-10.",lol paysafe turns out to be pay dangerous,1,0.498,NEGATIVE,0.739
