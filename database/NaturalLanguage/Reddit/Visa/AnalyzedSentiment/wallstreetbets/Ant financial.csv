,"Okay fellas. I'm sick of seeing the same shit here. You guys turned into Apple, Tesla, Nvidia, and Amazonbets. Here's a nugget of gold for you that most of you will ignore. Alibaba's financial/payment platform, Ant financial, spun off years ago. What's so great about them? Imagine purchasing shares in Visa and PayPal simultaneously. Theyre virtually the only game in town in China. Theyre seeking more than 30 billion in their IPO, making this the largest IPO in history with way more upside than Aramco ( 2nd largest IPO ever). They've filed for an IPO but they've refused to list on the NYSE. How do you buy? Thats a two-fold answer....if you only have Robinhood or Webull than you're fucked (sorta). You need a legitimate platform like Etrade or Charles Schwab. If you give a shit, you'll figure it out. Whats the second way to buy you ask? Alibaba has a 30% stake in Ant and they're destined to rise alongside Ant. Pick a call and strike date at least 90 days out. Your upside using option 1 is much higher buy option 2 will still make you a solid return. Please post the gain porn if you follow my advice. I'll do the same. TLDR: Read it fuckface",been balls deep in baba for forever. Just bought another december 18th 310c last week. When ant ipo happens baba hitting 370,0,0.524,0.997,NEGATIVE
