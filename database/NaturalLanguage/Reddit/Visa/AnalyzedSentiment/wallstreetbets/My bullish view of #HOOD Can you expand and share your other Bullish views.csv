International expansion, the great wealth transfer and taking stabs at other verticals (wealth management, credit cards, events contracts) will diversify their revenue streams and are huge bullish catalysts. Market downturns will be tough on the stock, but I expect it to massively outperform the market over time. There simply isn‚Äôt a better brokerage option available currently.

But I do see other brokerages.Then there is the the average person and disposable income that goes into stocks. If inflation rises, cost of living rises, the average person wont be able to invest or trade, which is not a good sign.Then there is crypto, which is great right now in its bull run, but what if crypto tanks, more scams come out, hood has a lot of revenue generated from crypto and that market is too volatile, a bad swing can have a major impact on the negative for hood.Personally I believe in HOOD but its ran up way too much this past few months, I think its time to exit soon.",0,0.527,NEGATIVE,1.0
