,"I have been running the numbers, and things aren't looking good. My mother's husband's wife boyfriend is big in the stock game, and he was frowning this morning when he read the newspaper. Look at this graph I just saw on Bloomberg: I'm not a genius but this bad. It gets worse guys. Have you heard about this thing in Ukraine? I hear Russia refuses to sell gas to them and that is pretty messed up. If I didn't ride a bike to my Wendy's shifts I would have to pay at least a McChicken more in gas money more than I usually do. (bullish on bike sellers btw) I did some independent journalism because I don't trust the MSM. Look at this consumer report I found: boom. Pretty bad if you ask me. While we are on the news of bad have you heard of this little know country called China??? I know their economy is on the brink because I did not hear one person talk about the olympic games, hell I didn't even know they were happening. More people watched my sister's dance recital than the olympics, and I didn't even make a scene this time! Look at this chart regarding the hosing market! boom. (pt 2) And don't even get me started on the MM in the market, those billion dollar giants are more screwed than the rest of us. Why? Because they had the gall to loan me money (bearish on my credit card bills). Margin call that Visa. Finally, I know this is bad because I've seen at least 3 facebook posts from my uncle talking about how the US government is going to fall like Rome did. Overall, I follow retail, and when all of retail assumes that the affects of gas, fed rates and war aren't priced in, that's when I know to sell. Overall, It's time to corner some rare vegetable markets, the only commodities I trust.

Look at this graph I just saw on Bloomberg: I'm not a genius but this bad. It gets worse guys. Have you heard about this thing in Ukraine? I hear Russia refuses to sell gas to them and that is pretty messed up. If I didn't ride a bike to my Wendy's shifts I would have to pay at least a McChicken more in gas money more than I usually do. (bullish on bike sellers btw) I did some independent journalism because I don't trust the MSM. Look at this consumer report I found: boom. Pretty bad if you ask me. While we are on the news of bad have you heard of this little know country called China??? I know their economy is on the brink because I did not hear one person talk about the olympic games, hell I didn't even know they were happening. More people watched my sister's dance recital than the olympics, and I didn't even make a scene this time! Look at this chart regarding the hosing market! boom. (pt 2) And don't even get me started on the MM in the market, those billion dollar giants are more screwed than the rest of us. Why? Because they had the gall to loan me money (bearish on my credit card bills). Margin call that Visa. Finally, I know this is bad because I've seen at least 3 facebook posts from my uncle talking about how the US government is going to fall like Rome did. Overall, I follow retail, and when all of retail assumes that the affects of gas, fed rates and war aren't priced in, that's when I know to sell. Overall, It's time to corner some rare vegetable markets, the only commodities I trust.
