,"Respected Traders & Investors, I know folks, it's hard. Just hang on for a few more weeks. Okay!!! A fake exit liquidity rally like March FOMC is just around the corner. So please bear with me. I know times are tough, but guys, we have gotta dig deep and stick around. Until then let's have some fun creating a portfolio. A BS story from my dreams. Might as well skip it. ( Especially Tl;Dr folks ) Story about an island doom. Before we begin creating our portfolio, let me tell you all a story. It goes like there was an island in the middle of a huge ocean where everybody was having a blast. Rich people bought their yachts and the common folks brought their gondola boats. Everyday, the rich and common people used to boat around from the island shore to the middle of the ocean for food. The rich guys used their expensive equipment while the common folks used the traditional method of net for hunt. After everyone was done with their hunting, they used to head back to the island. As the night came down, the rich folks partied on their yachts, while the common folks used to party on the island itself and hence sleep in the stone cave passed by generations. As the days continued by, the people now had to go a little further from the day before because they weren't a lot of things left to hunt in the regions they used to before. As they were going far into the ocean, people started seeing many whales emerging from beneath the ocean. They looked kinda sick because they weren't moving a lot. No one knew the reason why they were slowly dying. Some folks saw this as a warning sign so they took off back to their island. But the rich folks didn't care, and so did some common folks. As the day passed by sharks started appearing in one's, two's and three's, and so on. With passing of each day there were more sharks than the previous one. They used to come for those whales and then leave. Slowly, all the whales disappeared, and hence the sharks too. Everyone thought it was all back to normal, so they continued with their hunting. But then came that fateful day when a swarm of sharks, which looked so hungry, started attacking the people in boats. Heck, there were some big hungry sharks that they even attacked the rick folks yacht. So both the common and rich folks tried to boat around back to the island for safety, but they had come so far off this time around. The yachts, though, were fast so they came back quickly, but the gondola boats were slow. Only the few lucky ones survived. It was all silence on the island. Everyone was quite afraid to head back to the far off water. Days past by and slowly we could see the water in the ocean started disappearing. Everybody was in amazement, like they saw some kind of magic, but some folks knew this was just the beginning of the bad days that were about to come. As months passed, the people started becoming angry because they now had to look for food in the jungle which wasn't quite tasteful compared to seafood. The rich folks used to come visit the island jungle, too, and take whatever they pleased.. At first people let it be because they thought the resources of the jungle were in plenty. But slowly, as time passed by they too became scarce. Now people from both sides were really getting angry. Riots started breaking out around b/w rich and common folks. The people started fighting against each other. The situation got so bad that rich folks started burning the places of ordinary folks. To which people replied back by throwing rocks at the yachts. As the years passed by, only the few survived to live the tale and were able to live off of the island's scare resources. As time progressed the water in the ocean started coming back and so were resources of the island that got depleted, replenished as more folks started going around for the hunt. And hence the cycle repeated itself again for 10 or more yrs. Moral of the story : I leave it to you people to decide in the comments section. Also, the last paragraph is kinda my interpretation of what happened. I leave that up to you. Hey, maybe no one survived to live the tale. Streak of losses Recap : 16th May - 20th May The last week was pretty crazy. S&P 500 finally entered its bear market and dropped to almost -22%. whereas the Nasdaq declined about -30% making this market performance as the worst since 1931 ""Great depression"". We also had 7 straight weeks of red which is just behind the March 2001 ""Dotcom crash"" and May 1970 ""Stagflation"". Apple warning : Later i said if Apple looks bad so will Tesla. Because both are cash Hedge. As my viewers already know we talked about Apple and Tesla warning in my last post where i was worried about their charts. So it indeed happened. Apple dropped below its 100 week MA and Tesla got hammered with FUD articles. Elon Musk thinks its a ploy by democrats.. What do y'all think. Tell me about in the comments section. By the way guys I see no one in Wall street bets talk about things before 1987. Why is that ? Everyone just wants to either compare things with recent recession of 2008 or they want the 1987 ""Black Monday"" crash where DOW dropped -20% in a day. I think people are really getting tired of this constant velocity crash with no acceleration to the downside. Some Economists thinks Powell should just rug-pull and kill the economy in a day. Why to wait for 6 months when things can be done in a day. Pretty shitty argument in my opinion cause why would you want to pressure economy in just a single day. Also some other Economists are calling for retail capitulation. I have no idea guys. It could come or not come before June or July FOMC. But it sure is heck is coming in Q4. ( It will be marked by capitulation in retail stocks, ) Hedge funds top Investments I was very lucky last week to have time and watch ""Jeremy Grantham"" and ""Ray Dalio"" my two favorite logical investors together for an online video conference where they talked about their views on economy. Both of them have a pretty different outlook for the future. Ray believes the changing world order is about to happen in this cycle where the China and rest other emerging markets from Asia such as India will boom as compared to USA where we could have a bust. (But his fund has an allocation to FTSE 100. Interesting) Jeremy believes we are in for a dotcom style crash. But both of them don't believe in the idea of recession this year but yeah the risk of stagflation are increasing day by day according to them. Growth in their opinion though will be slowing in the upcoming years. Also do watch ""All in podcast"" show. In latest episode we have a guy who predicted 5 out of the last 3 recessions and invested in We work.ðŸ˜‚ Okay moving on lets summarize key highlights of this week from CNBC television : Jet blue hostile bid for spirit airlines. Boeing is shit. Elon twitter drama. Oil to $150 after china deal. Warren Buffet buying energy and increasing stake in occidental petroleum. Healthcare and energy can be defensive and aggressive play for portfolio managers this year. Netflix upgraded by a bear. Walmart & Target earnings disaster. Retail sales 0.9% est 1% in April. Job cuts in Netflix and HOOD. Hiring freeze in Facebook & COIN. Fin-tech bottom is in according to analysts. Google is good in economic slowdown. Growth scare. Long term bond buying and equities falling regardless. The White House is now looking to cut corporate greed. Looks like no more price gouging. The unhedged hedge fund Melvin capital is shutting down. You guys did it. David won against Goliath. Identify the difference b/w short covering and bear market rally. Biden meets leaders of Sweden, Finland. Meaning they are going to join NATO this year. We have Monkey pox to deal with. Twitter says it's the courtesy of Bill Gates. Auto loan delinquencies hits highest since 2007. Sam Bank-man Fried bought Robinhood. FTX is about to start stock trading. Meaning if CBDC's by government arrives then petro dollar becomes hetero dollar of trading worldwide. Where we stand Now since many of you guys are new here. Let me bore you once again. We will eventually go into b/w of forgotten depression of 1921 and full blown depression. Depression is just a longer lasting recession. Recession in my opinion will happen later in Q4 because I don't think coming GDP print will be -ve but i think next one and the next one in January will be. Hence i always say when Dow jones hits anywhere b/w 50 MMA - 200 MMA just start DCAing in index ( picking stocks is hard ) like SPX, Nasdaq, DJI. Or if you really wanna buy stocks then go ahead pick the best stocks and DCA ( no one knows the true bottom ) that will last 10yrs. And have patience and conviction. Also we have short term swing trade in indices coming up. We could do this by DCAing index in before June or July FOMC and then sell in before September arrives. You could play options or specific stocks but i wont help you with which ones. I prefer index. Charts of the week Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 1 : The 10yr breakevens on the chart are first thing that tops. It tells investors inflation problem is about to happen. Then it's the inflation that starts rising. Now depending upon the inflation level the bond yields rise. More the inflation more the Fed becomes hawkish. Hence at the end its the interest rate that tops. So in a sense 10yr breakevens are the leading indicator for inflation level. Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 2 : The 40 year cycle. We already know that the stock market revolves around a cycle. The 1940 - 1980 cycle in which the bond yields made higher high's and higher low's. And then the 1980 - 2020 cycle where bond yields made a lower high's and lower low's. During the first 40 cycle the interest rate peaked before the bond yields and were more higher in number. In the next 40 cycle the interest rate peaked after the bond yields and were much lower. The Boom Bust cycles XD Observation 3 : ( Don't laugh) So everyone knows how a economy works. I have taken a segment from a way longer cycle of economics passed from generations. ( The 90yr cycle ) We have a period of boom and then we have a period of bust. The boom period from 1980-2020 is over in my opinion where the talk was about globalization Chart : Dow Jones , Orange line : Bond yields , Blue line : Inflation Observation 4 : Let's find out where in history we could be. So high inflation with low bond yields right. So it could be the 1940's or 1948 when Fed decided to kill inflation by raising rates so high that it caused a deflationary period. Result : I have no idea where are we. This experiment was for nothing or maybe it was. But we pose similarity to all of the periods. Disease | Russia wise : 1921 Forgotten depression Chart wise and cycle wise : 1929 depression. Rate, Inflation and bond wise : 1940's. News event wise : 1970's stagflation. Technology and funding wise : 2000 dotcom bubble. WSB wise : 2008 recession. Welcome to the Jungle : Its time for our portfolio building Look guys before we begin let me tell you i am not an expert of fundamental analyzing the companies. But what i am good at is knowing the narratives beforehand and combining it with my technical analysis on stock market where it is headed. But yah of course i do watch earnings and this week is gonna be awesome. Let us begin this unique way of investing. This week : Earnings + FOMC minutes. Hypothesis : If stock valuation relative to others becomes cheap then the algorithms created by big institutions and Hedge funds will buy the stock and sell it quickly or hold according to their analysts or portfolio manger if they are interesting on betting the stock for next cycle. We are going to construct the most knowable portfolio passed down by the generations before. It's called a 60-40% portfolio. But we are gonna make few adjustments to it. Equities : 60% -> 40% USA + 20% international Bonds : 40% -> 30% bonds + 10% metals. We don't take commodities because they are for trading purposes mostly. Step 1 : 10% metals Gold Silver Since we are in 1921, 1929, 1940, 1970, 2000 or 2008. what we know is gold parabolic move is sure to happen. But what we don't know is when to buy gold. We all know in financial crisis gold will fall too or when Powell goes for aggressive rate hike. But it wont capitulate like equities because gold moves slow. It's only in the parabolic moves that gold moves fast. But there are factors that causes it. So the narrative around it will surely come by 2025. Meaning. We buy some now and some portion in crisis. We will add silver too because it will move a lot if Gold goes parabolic.Kinda like how large cap help move small caps. Result : $6 Gold ( $3 right now + $3 in crisis ) + $4 Silver ( $2 right now + $2 in crisis ) Step 2 : 30% bonds. Now this thing is kinda hard to predict and is a matter of preference because there are many types of bonds available. What i will be doing is outperforming those other corporate bonds which gives high return but there are risk associated with it. This chart tell us low yield bonds are about to be bought as compared to high yield risk bonds So I picked TMF for this because i'm chasing high returns with no risk at all. Yes sure its a leveraged ETF but from this chart i know in coming few months most investors will be flocking to longer yield bonds because the growth scare hasn't yet been priced in. Hence the TMF bond will peak because of max euphoria at the end of Q4. My projection are already given in the charts. The only risk to it is change in terminal rates (3.2% aug 2023) or changing the definition of neutral.( 2-3%) TMF ( No income ) = 3 x TLT ( It gives fixed income quarterly ) Result : $15 right now in TMF + $15 ( wait for june TLT ) Step 3 : 60% Equities. Next 60% will be to equities. For this i will picking winner stock with 2025 max profits guarantees. It is up to you guys to decide which winner stock and how much should be in portfolio. And at what price levels are you comfortable with. a) Voldemort class ( These class of stocks are linked to the asset class i cannot name here because i will get banned. But hey we can name the stocks ) Includes : MTTR, MSTR, COIN, HOOD, HUT8, COIN, Winner : MTTR, COIN Reason : MSTR is bound to get liquidated since saylor is known for crisis like dotcom. HOOD c'mon guys we all hate it. Also Vlad is such a shit CEO. If he gets removed as CEO and Sam Bank man like Elon makes a play for position then heck yes. It could be proxy to investing with FTX. HUT8 hmm. I just don't like mining stocks. Matterport on the other hand has got metaverse play in it. So im expecting it to do a 8x by then and everybody loves Brian. Heck even the SEC too. He's got good leadership skills and would do anything for the company. $40 was such a good deal. Man i missed it. It was trading below its funding valuation and 2x the money they had. b) EV play. Includes : Rivian, Ford, GM, Tesla, Nio, Lucid Winner : Tesla, Nio Reason : I'm going calling the dibs on Tesla even though its price can fall to $380. Coz why won't you wanna have Tesla in your portfolio. Its still got India play left inside it. Yes supply chain are the problems but i believe this company will get help from china. Hence Nio too. So allocate some to Tesla and Nio. Nio because George Soros who broke bank of England is buying heavy. So Hf's or institutions would not even possibly think of shorting this stock. Such is the fear of Soros in Wallstreet. c) Gaming play + Chips Includes : AMD, Intel, Nvidia Winner : Nvidia ( Little partial ) Reason : I am partial to this even though AMD has started producing cheaper and better products and aren't suffering in supply chain as much. Nvidia in my opinion is world class and its products last longer than other products. Also there is a heavy demand by consumers. Nothing will ever change that. It's kinda like Apple of the space. Also its the leading in ml + ai too. I believe Tesla and Nvidia will partner in future. I could be wrong here and hey maybe AMD kicks its butt but i'm gonna go Nvidia. Also AMD has to fight some FUD articles in the future. Its up to you guys to decide. But i sure as hell don't want you to buy intel. d ) Payment play Includes : VISA, Master card, PayPal Winner : Paypal Reason :They are doing so much in Voldomort asset class. VISA wtf are you doing though by joking around with that sh9t. e ) The others Rest guys i believe in peace so no Palantir for me. And since Jamie Dimon is leaving i think JP Morgan will fall. If he stick around till 2025 then i sure as hell would keep this in my portfolio. Also i don't want Ecom in portfolio ( AMZN + Target + Walmart ) but i sure as hell want Google. Its got that growth in slowing economy factor for me. Because who forgets to search on google and play videos on Youtube. And then there is Cathie wood and her Roku. Look guys if she is doing an insider trading and knows something about the company that we don't then sure go all in on that stock only. Also remember the people who created SARKK have launched another ETF called ARKK leveraged 3x. So maybe if money flows around in it like SARKK then hey Roku gets most of the money since its her top holding. Winner : Google + Roku ( On your own level of risk ) f ) International Since China is about to stimulate its economy and Hong Kong basically is under china control then expect the popular stocks over there to grow as well. Includes : BABA, JD, Tencent Winner : BABA, Bytedance ( If it goes public ) Reason : Amazon and Target money will flow here. Also the low PE / PEG ratio is highly attractive. And hey Munger is buying alongside Blackrock and Bridgwater. Remember we chose Nio too. So keep them at 20% and divide yourselves. Note : The winner decision is solely according to me. Also i haven't given the price levels to buy. That is upto you guys to decide. This is not a Financial advise. As for the proof that i am buying here are my positions on some of the things that i went shopping around. Tesla + TMF The amount has not yet been credited yet. Result : It shall be knows until 2024-2025. Conclusion : Fuck i don't know if it will work. But hey if a monkey can beat the stock market so can this monkey too. P.s. I was quite heartbroken on Sunday so i was unable to write anything. Had to drink so much that this time that i couldn't write anything. Liverpool lost the EPL guys. We came so close. Had the Villa hold on for 20 more minutes what a script it would have been. Felt bad for that goalie though and Gerrard. Imagine slipping twice. Next week we kick Real ass in UCL. (Post Hang over post ) With lots of love guys. Thank you. Regards Uchiha",100$ portfolio? r/antstreetbets -->,0,0.522,NEGATIVE,0.525

But hey we can name the stocks ) Includes : MTTR, MSTR, COIN, HOOD, HUT8, COIN, Winner : MTTR, COIN Reason : MSTR is bound to get liquidated since saylor is known for crisis like dotcom. HOOD c'mon guys we all hate it. Also Vlad is such a shit CEO. If he gets removed as CEO and Sam Bank man like Elon makes a play for position then heck yes. It could be proxy to investing with FTX. HUT8 hmm. I just don't like mining stocks. Matterport on the other hand has got metaverse play in it. So im expecting it to do a 8x by then and everybody loves Brian. Heck even the SEC too. He's got good leadership skills and would do anything for the company. $40 was such a good deal. Man i missed it. It was trading below its funding valuation and 2x the money they had. b) EV play. Includes : Rivian, Ford, GM, Tesla, Nio, Lucid Winner : Tesla, Nio Reason : I'm going calling the dibs on Tesla even though its price can fall to $380. Coz why won't you wanna have Tesla in your portfolio. Its still got India play left inside it. Yes supply chain are the problems but i believe this company will get help from china. Hence Nio too. So allocate some to Tesla and Nio. Nio because George Soros who broke bank of England is buying heavy. So Hf's or institutions would not even possibly think of shorting this stock. Such is the fear of Soros in Wallstreet. c) Gaming play + Chips Includes : AMD, Intel, Nvidia Winner : Nvidia ( Little partial ) Reason : I am partial to this even though AMD has started producing cheaper and better products and aren't suffering in supply chain as much. Nvidia in my opinion is world class and its products last longer than other products. Also there is a heavy demand by consumers. Nothing will ever change that. It's kinda like Apple of the space. Also its the leading in ml + ai too. I believe Tesla and Nvidia will partner in future. I could be wrong here and hey maybe AMD kicks its butt but i'm gonna go Nvidia. Also AMD has to fight some FUD articles in the future. Its up to you guys to decide. But i sure as hell don't want you to buy intel. d ) Payment play Includes : VISA, Master card, PayPal Winner : Paypal Reason :They are doing so much in Voldomort asset class. VISA wtf are you doing though by joking around with that sh9t. e ) The others Rest guys i believe in peace so no Palantir for me. And since Jamie Dimon is leaving i think JP Morgan will fall. If he stick around till 2025 then i sure as hell would keep this in my portfolio. Also i don't want Ecom in portfolio ( AMZN + Target + Walmart ) but i sure as hell want Google. Its got that growth in slowing economy factor for me. Because who forgets to search on google and play videos on Youtube. And then there is Cathie wood and her Roku. Look guys if she is doing an insider trading and knows something about the company that we don't then sure go all in on that stock only. Also remember the people who created SARKK have launched another ETF called ARKK leveraged 3x. So maybe if money flows around in it like SARKK then hey Roku gets most of the money since its her top holding. Winner : Google + Roku ( On your own level of risk ) f ) International Since China is about to stimulate its economy and Hong Kong basically is under china control then expect the popular stocks over there to grow as well. Includes : BABA, JD, Tencent Winner : BABA, Bytedance ( If it goes public ) Reason : Amazon and Target money will flow here. Also the low PE / PEG ratio is highly attractive. And hey Munger is buying alongside Blackrock and Bridgwater. Remember we chose Nio too. So keep them at 20% and divide yourselves. Note : The winner decision is solely according to me. Also i haven't given the price levels to buy. That is upto you guys to decide. This is not a Financial advise. As for the proof that i am buying here are my positions on some of the things that i went shopping around. Tesla + TMF The amount has not yet been credited yet. Result : It shall be knows until 2024-2025. Conclusion : Fuck i don't know if it will work. But hey if a monkey can beat the stock market so can this monkey too. P.s. I was quite heartbroken on Sunday so i was unable to write anything. Had to drink so much that this time that i couldn't write anything. Liverpool lost the EPL guys. We came so close. Had the Villa hold on for 20 more minutes what a script it would have been. Felt bad for that goalie though and Gerrard. Imagine slipping twice. Next week we kick Real ass in UCL.

,"Respected Traders & Investors, I know folks, it's hard. Just hang on for a few more weeks. Okay!!! A fake exit liquidity rally like March FOMC is just around the corner. So please bear with me. I know times are tough, but guys, we have gotta dig deep and stick around. Until then let's have some fun creating a portfolio. A BS story from my dreams. Might as well skip it. ( Especially Tl;Dr folks ) Story about an island doom. Before we begin creating our portfolio, let me tell you all a story. It goes like there was an island in the middle of a huge ocean where everybody was having a blast. Rich people bought their yachts and the common folks brought their gondola boats. Everyday, the rich and common people used to boat around from the island shore to the middle of the ocean for food. The rich guys used their expensive equipment while the common folks used the traditional method of net for hunt. After everyone was done with their hunting, they used to head back to the island. As the night came down, the rich folks partied on their yachts, while the common folks used to party on the island itself and hence sleep in the stone cave passed by generations. As the days continued by, the people now had to go a little further from the day before because they weren't a lot of things left to hunt in the regions they used to before. As they were going far into the ocean, people started seeing many whales emerging from beneath the ocean. They looked kinda sick because they weren't moving a lot. No one knew the reason why they were slowly dying. Some folks saw this as a warning sign so they took off back to their island. But the rich folks didn't care, and so did some common folks. As the day passed by sharks started appearing in one's, two's and three's, and so on. With passing of each day there were more sharks than the previous one. They used to come for those whales and then leave. Slowly, all the whales disappeared, and hence the sharks too. Everyone thought it was all back to normal, so they continued with their hunting. But then came that fateful day when a swarm of sharks, which looked so hungry, started attacking the people in boats. Heck, there were some big hungry sharks that they even attacked the rick folks yacht. So both the common and rich folks tried to boat around back to the island for safety, but they had come so far off this time around. The yachts, though, were fast so they came back quickly, but the gondola boats were slow. Only the few lucky ones survived. It was all silence on the island. Everyone was quite afraid to head back to the far off water. Days past by and slowly we could see the water in the ocean started disappearing. Everybody was in amazement, like they saw some kind of magic, but some folks knew this was just the beginning of the bad days that were about to come. As months passed, the people started becoming angry because they now had to look for food in the jungle which wasn't quite tasteful compared to seafood. The rich folks used to come visit the island jungle, too, and take whatever they pleased.. At first people let it be because they thought the resources of the jungle were in plenty. But slowly, as time passed by they too became scarce. Now people from both sides were really getting angry. Riots started breaking out around b/w rich and common folks. The people started fighting against each other. The situation got so bad that rich folks started burning the places of ordinary folks. To which people replied back by throwing rocks at the yachts. As the years passed by, only the few survived to live the tale and were able to live off of the island's scare resources. As time progressed the water in the ocean started coming back and so were resources of the island that got depleted, replenished as more folks started going around for the hunt. And hence the cycle repeated itself again for 10 or more yrs. Moral of the story : I leave it to you people to decide in the comments section. Also, the last paragraph is kinda my interpretation of what happened. I leave that up to you. Hey, maybe no one survived to live the tale. Streak of losses Recap : 16th May - 20th May The last week was pretty crazy. S&P 500 finally entered its bear market and dropped to almost -22%. whereas the Nasdaq declined about -30% making this market performance as the worst since 1931 ""Great depression"". We also had 7 straight weeks of red which is just behind the March 2001 ""Dotcom crash"" and May 1970 ""Stagflation"". Apple warning : Later i said if Apple looks bad so will Tesla. Because both are cash Hedge. As my viewers already know we talked about Apple and Tesla warning in my last post where i was worried about their charts. So it indeed happened. Apple dropped below its 100 week MA and Tesla got hammered with FUD articles. Elon Musk thinks its a ploy by democrats.. What do y'all think. Tell me about in the comments section. By the way guys I see no one in Wall street bets talk about things before 1987. Why is that ? Everyone just wants to either compare things with recent recession of 2008 or they want the 1987 ""Black Monday"" crash where DOW dropped -20% in a day. I think people are really getting tired of this constant velocity crash with no acceleration to the downside. Some Economists thinks Powell should just rug-pull and kill the economy in a day. Why to wait for 6 months when things can be done in a day. Pretty shitty argument in my opinion cause why would you want to pressure economy in just a single day. Also some other Economists are calling for retail capitulation. I have no idea guys. It could come or not come before June or July FOMC. But it sure is heck is coming in Q4. ( It will be marked by capitulation in retail stocks, ) Hedge funds top Investments I was very lucky last week to have time and watch ""Jeremy Grantham"" and ""Ray Dalio"" my two favorite logical investors together for an online video conference where they talked about their views on economy. Both of them have a pretty different outlook for the future. Ray believes the changing world order is about to happen in this cycle where the China and rest other emerging markets from Asia such as India will boom as compared to USA where we could have a bust. (But his fund has an allocation to FTSE 100. Interesting) Jeremy believes we are in for a dotcom style crash. But both of them don't believe in the idea of recession this year but yeah the risk of stagflation are increasing day by day according to them. Growth in their opinion though will be slowing in the upcoming years. Also do watch ""All in podcast"" show. In latest episode we have a guy who predicted 5 out of the last 3 recessions and invested in We work.ðŸ˜‚ Okay moving on lets summarize key highlights of this week from CNBC television : Jet blue hostile bid for spirit airlines. Boeing is shit. Elon twitter drama. Oil to $150 after china deal. Warren Buffet buying energy and increasing stake in occidental petroleum. Healthcare and energy can be defensive and aggressive play for portfolio managers this year. Netflix upgraded by a bear. Walmart & Target earnings disaster. Retail sales 0.9% est 1% in April. Job cuts in Netflix and HOOD. Hiring freeze in Facebook & COIN. Fin-tech bottom is in according to analysts. Google is good in economic slowdown. Growth scare. Long term bond buying and equities falling regardless. The White House is now looking to cut corporate greed. Looks like no more price gouging. The unhedged hedge fund Melvin capital is shutting down. You guys did it. David won against Goliath. Identify the difference b/w short covering and bear market rally. Biden meets leaders of Sweden, Finland. Meaning they are going to join NATO this year. We have Monkey pox to deal with. Twitter says it's the courtesy of Bill Gates. Auto loan delinquencies hits highest since 2007. Sam Bank-man Fried bought Robinhood. FTX is about to start stock trading. Meaning if CBDC's by government arrives then petro dollar becomes hetero dollar of trading worldwide. Where we stand Now since many of you guys are new here. Let me bore you once again. We will eventually go into b/w of forgotten depression of 1921 and full blown depression. Depression is just a longer lasting recession. Recession in my opinion will happen later in Q4 because I don't think coming GDP print will be -ve but i think next one and the next one in January will be. Hence i always say when Dow jones hits anywhere b/w 50 MMA - 200 MMA just start DCAing in index ( picking stocks is hard ) like SPX, Nasdaq, DJI. Or if you really wanna buy stocks then go ahead pick the best stocks and DCA ( no one knows the true bottom ) that will last 10yrs. And have patience and conviction. Also we have short term swing trade in indices coming up. We could do this by DCAing index in before June or July FOMC and then sell in before September arrives. You could play options or specific stocks but i wont help you with which ones. I prefer index. Charts of the week Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 1 : The 10yr breakevens on the chart are first thing that tops. It tells investors inflation problem is about to happen. Then it's the inflation that starts rising. Now depending upon the inflation level the bond yields rise. More the inflation more the Fed becomes hawkish. Hence at the end its the interest rate that tops. So in a sense 10yr breakevens are the leading indicator for inflation level. Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 2 : The 40 year cycle. We already know that the stock market revolves around a cycle. The 1940 - 1980 cycle in which the bond yields made higher high's and higher low's. And then the 1980 - 2020 cycle where bond yields made a lower high's and lower low's. During the first 40 cycle the interest rate peaked before the bond yields and were more higher in number. In the next 40 cycle the interest rate peaked after the bond yields and were much lower. The Boom Bust cycles XD Observation 3 : ( Don't laugh) So everyone knows how a economy works. I have taken a segment from a way longer cycle of economics passed from generations. ( The 90yr cycle ) We have a period of boom and then we have a period of bust. The boom period from 1980-2020 is over in my opinion where the talk was about globalization Chart : Dow Jones , Orange line : Bond yields , Blue line : Inflation Observation 4 : Let's find out where in history we could be. So high inflation with low bond yields right. So it could be the 1940's or 1948 when Fed decided to kill inflation by raising rates so high that it caused a deflationary period. Result : I have no idea where are we. This experiment was for nothing or maybe it was. But we pose similarity to all of the periods. Disease | Russia wise : 1921 Forgotten depression Chart wise and cycle wise : 1929 depression. Rate, Inflation and bond wise : 1940's. News event wise : 1970's stagflation. Technology and funding wise : 2000 dotcom bubble. WSB wise : 2008 recession. Welcome to the Jungle : Its time for our portfolio building Look guys before we begin let me tell you i am not an expert of fundamental analyzing the companies. But what i am good at is knowing the narratives beforehand and combining it with my technical analysis on stock market where it is headed. But yah of course i do watch earnings and this week is gonna be awesome. Let us begin this unique way of investing. This week : Earnings + FOMC minutes. Hypothesis : If stock valuation relative to others becomes cheap then the algorithms created by big institutions and Hedge funds will buy the stock and sell it quickly or hold according to their analysts or portfolio manger if they are interesting on betting the stock for next cycle. We are going to construct the most knowable portfolio passed down by the generations before. It's called a 60-40% portfolio. But we are gonna make few adjustments to it. Equities : 60% -> 40% USA + 20% international Bonds : 40% -> 30% bonds + 10% metals. We don't take commodities because they are for trading purposes mostly. Step 1 : 10% metals Gold Silver Since we are in 1921, 1929, 1940, 1970, 2000 or 2008. what we know is gold parabolic move is sure to happen. But what we don't know is when to buy gold. We all know in financial crisis gold will fall too or when Powell goes for aggressive rate hike. But it wont capitulate like equities because gold moves slow. It's only in the parabolic moves that gold moves fast. But there are factors that causes it. So the narrative around it will surely come by 2025. Meaning. We buy some now and some portion in crisis. We will add silver too because it will move a lot if Gold goes parabolic.Kinda like how large cap help move small caps. Result : $6 Gold ( $3 right now + $3 in crisis ) + $4 Silver ( $2 right now + $2 in crisis ) Step 2 : 30% bonds. Now this thing is kinda hard to predict and is a matter of preference because there are many types of bonds available. What i will be doing is outperforming those other corporate bonds which gives high return but there are risk associated with it. This chart tell us low yield bonds are about to be bought as compared to high yield risk bonds So I picked TMF for this because i'm chasing high returns with no risk at all. Yes sure its a leveraged ETF but from this chart i know in coming few months most investors will be flocking to longer yield bonds because the growth scare hasn't yet been priced in. Hence the TMF bond will peak because of max euphoria at the end of Q4. My projection are already given in the charts. The only risk to it is change in terminal rates (3.2% aug 2023) or changing the definition of neutral.( 2-3%) TMF ( No income ) = 3 x TLT ( It gives fixed income quarterly ) Result : $15 right now in TMF + $15 ( wait for june TLT ) Step 3 : 60% Equities. Next 60% will be to equities. For this i will picking winner stock with 2025 max profits guarantees. It is up to you guys to decide which winner stock and how much should be in portfolio. And at what price levels are you comfortable with. a) Voldemort class ( These class of stocks are linked to the asset class i cannot name here because i will get banned.

We already know that the stock market revolves around a cycle. The 1940 - 1980 cycle in which the bond yields made higher high's and higher low's. And then the 1980 - 2020 cycle where bond yields made a lower high's and lower low's. During the first 40 cycle the interest rate peaked before the bond yields and were more higher in number. In the next 40 cycle the interest rate peaked after the bond yields and were much lower. The Boom Bust cycles XD Observation 3 : ( Don't laugh) So everyone knows how a economy works. I have taken a segment from a way longer cycle of economics passed from generations. ( The 90yr cycle ) We have a period of boom and then we have a period of bust. The boom period from 1980-2020 is over in my opinion where the talk was about globalization Chart : Dow Jones , Orange line : Bond yields , Blue line : Inflation Observation 4 : Let's find out where in history we could be. So high inflation with low bond yields right. So it could be the 1940's or 1948 when Fed decided to kill inflation by raising rates so high that it caused a deflationary period. Result : I have no idea where are we. This experiment was for nothing or maybe it was. But we pose similarity to all of the periods. Disease | Russia wise : 1921 Forgotten depression Chart wise and cycle wise : 1929 depression. Rate, Inflation and bond wise : 1940's. News event wise : 1970's stagflation. Technology and funding wise : 2000 dotcom bubble. WSB wise : 2008 recession. Welcome to the Jungle : Its time for our portfolio building Look guys before we begin let me tell you i am not an expert of fundamental analyzing the companies. But what i am good at is knowing the narratives beforehand and combining it with my technical analysis on stock market where it is headed. But yah of course i do watch earnings and this week is gonna be awesome. Let us begin this unique way of investing. This week : Earnings + FOMC minutes. Hypothesis : If stock valuation relative to others becomes cheap then the algorithms created by big institutions and Hedge funds will buy the stock and sell it quickly or hold according to their analysts or portfolio manger if they are interesting on betting the stock for next cycle. We are going to construct the most knowable portfolio passed down by the generations before. It's called a 60-40% portfolio. But we are gonna make few adjustments to it. Equities : 60% -> 40% USA + 20% international Bonds : 40% -> 30% bonds + 10% metals. We don't take commodities because they are for trading purposes mostly. Step 1 : 10% metals Gold Silver Since we are in 1921, 1929, 1940, 1970, 2000 or 2008. what we know is gold parabolic move is sure to happen. But what we don't know is when to buy gold. We all know in financial crisis gold will fall too or when Powell goes for aggressive rate hike. But it wont capitulate like equities because gold moves slow. It's only in the parabolic moves that gold moves fast. But there are factors that causes it. So the narrative around it will surely come by 2025. Meaning. We buy some now and some portion in crisis. We will add silver too because it will move a lot if Gold goes parabolic.Kinda like how large cap help move small caps. Result : $6 Gold ( $3 right now + $3 in crisis ) + $4 Silver ( $2 right now + $2 in crisis ) Step 2 : 30% bonds. Now this thing is kinda hard to predict and is a matter of preference because there are many types of bonds available. What i will be doing is outperforming those other corporate bonds which gives high return but there are risk associated with it. This chart tell us low yield bonds are about to be bought as compared to high yield risk bonds So I picked TMF for this because i'm chasing high returns with no risk at all. Yes sure its a leveraged ETF but from this chart i know in coming few months most investors will be flocking to longer yield bonds because the growth scare hasn't yet been priced in. Hence the TMF bond will peak because of max euphoria at the end of Q4. My projection are already given in the charts. The only risk to it is change in terminal rates (3.2% aug 2023) or changing the definition of neutral.( 2-3%) TMF ( No income ) = 3 x TLT ( It gives fixed income quarterly ) Result : $15 right now in TMF + $15 ( wait for june TLT ) Step 3 : 60% Equities. Next 60% will be to equities. For this i will picking winner stock with 2025 max profits guarantees. It is up to you guys to decide which winner stock and how much should be in portfolio. And at what price levels are you comfortable with. a) Voldemort class ( These class of stocks are linked to the asset class i cannot name here because i will get banned. But hey we can name the stocks ) Includes : MTTR, MSTR, COIN, HOOD, HUT8, COIN, Winner : MTTR, COIN Reason : MSTR is bound to get liquidated since saylor is known for crisis like dotcom. HOOD c'mon guys we all hate it. Also Vlad is such a shit CEO. If he gets removed as CEO and Sam Bank man like Elon makes a play for position then heck yes. It could be proxy to investing with FTX. HUT8 hmm. I just don't like mining stocks. Matterport on the other hand has got metaverse play in it. So im expecting it to do a 8x by then and everybody loves Brian. Heck even the SEC too. He's got good leadership skills and would do anything for the company. $40 was such a good deal. Man i missed it. It was trading below its funding valuation and 2x the money they had. b) EV play. Includes : Rivian, Ford, GM, Tesla, Nio, Lucid Winner : Tesla, Nio Reason : I'm going calling the dibs on Tesla even though its price can fall to $380. Coz why won't you wanna have Tesla in your portfolio. Its still got India play left inside it. Yes supply chain are the problems but i believe this company will get help from china. Hence Nio too. So allocate some to Tesla and Nio. Nio because George Soros who broke bank of England is buying heavy. So Hf's or institutions would not even possibly think of shorting this stock. Such is the fear of Soros in Wallstreet. c) Gaming play + Chips Includes : AMD, Intel, Nvidia Winner : Nvidia ( Little partial ) Reason : I am partial to this even though AMD has started producing cheaper and better products and aren't suffering in supply chain as much. Nvidia in my opinion is world class and its products last longer than other products. Also there is a heavy demand by consumers. Nothing will ever change that. It's kinda like Apple of the space. Also its the leading in ml + ai too. I believe Tesla and Nvidia will partner in future. I could be wrong here and hey maybe AMD kicks its butt but i'm gonna go Nvidia. Also AMD has to fight some FUD articles in the future. Its up to you guys to decide. But i sure as hell don't want you to buy intel. d ) Payment play Includes : VISA, Master card, PayPal Winner : Paypal Reason :They are doing so much in Voldomort asset class. VISA wtf are you doing though by joking around with that sh9t. e ) The others Rest guys i believe in peace so no Palantir for me. And since Jamie Dimon is leaving i think JP Morgan will fall. If he stick around till 2025 then i sure as hell would keep this in my portfolio. Also i don't want Ecom in portfolio ( AMZN + Target + Walmart ) but i sure as hell want Google. Its got that growth in slowing economy factor for me. Because who forgets to search on google and play videos on Youtube. And then there is Cathie wood and her Roku. Look guys if she is doing an insider trading and knows something about the company that we don't then sure go all in on that stock only. Also remember the people who created SARKK have launched another ETF called ARKK leveraged 3x. So maybe if money flows around in it like SARKK then hey Roku gets most of the money since its her top holding. Winner : Google + Roku ( On your own level of risk ) f ) International Since China is about to stimulate its economy and Hong Kong basically is under china control then expect the popular stocks over there to grow as well. Includes : BABA, JD, Tencent Winner : BABA, Bytedance ( If it goes public ) Reason : Amazon and Target money will flow here. Also the low PE / PEG ratio is highly attractive. And hey Munger is buying alongside Blackrock and Bridgwater. Remember we chose Nio too. So keep them at 20% and divide yourselves. Note : The winner decision is solely according to me. Also i haven't given the price levels to buy. That is upto you guys to decide. This is not a Financial advise. As for the proof that i am buying here are my positions on some of the things that i went shopping around. Tesla + TMF The amount has not yet been credited yet. Result : It shall be knows until 2024-2025. Conclusion : Fuck i don't know if it will work. But hey if a monkey can beat the stock market so can this monkey too. P.s. I was quite heartbroken on Sunday so i was unable to write anything. Had to drink so much that this time that i couldn't write anything. Liverpool lost the EPL guys. We came so close. Had the Villa hold on for 20 more minutes what a script it would have been. Felt bad for that goalie though and Gerrard. Imagine slipping twice. Next week we kick Real ass in UCL.

,"Respected Traders & Investors, I know folks, it's hard. Just hang on for a few more weeks. Okay!!! A fake exit liquidity rally like March FOMC is just around the corner. So please bear with me. I know times are tough, but guys, we have gotta dig deep and stick around. Until then let's have some fun creating a portfolio. A BS story from my dreams. Might as well skip it. ( Especially Tl;Dr folks ) Story about an island doom. Before we begin creating our portfolio, let me tell you all a story. It goes like there was an island in the middle of a huge ocean where everybody was having a blast. Rich people bought their yachts and the common folks brought their gondola boats. Everyday, the rich and common people used to boat around from the island shore to the middle of the ocean for food. The rich guys used their expensive equipment while the common folks used the traditional method of net for hunt. After everyone was done with their hunting, they used to head back to the island. As the night came down, the rich folks partied on their yachts, while the common folks used to party on the island itself and hence sleep in the stone cave passed by generations. As the days continued by, the people now had to go a little further from the day before because they weren't a lot of things left to hunt in the regions they used to before. As they were going far into the ocean, people started seeing many whales emerging from beneath the ocean. They looked kinda sick because they weren't moving a lot. No one knew the reason why they were slowly dying. Some folks saw this as a warning sign so they took off back to their island. But the rich folks didn't care, and so did some common folks. As the day passed by sharks started appearing in one's, two's and three's, and so on. With passing of each day there were more sharks than the previous one. They used to come for those whales and then leave. Slowly, all the whales disappeared, and hence the sharks too. Everyone thought it was all back to normal, so they continued with their hunting. But then came that fateful day when a swarm of sharks, which looked so hungry, started attacking the people in boats. Heck, there were some big hungry sharks that they even attacked the rick folks yacht. So both the common and rich folks tried to boat around back to the island for safety, but they had come so far off this time around. The yachts, though, were fast so they came back quickly, but the gondola boats were slow. Only the few lucky ones survived. It was all silence on the island. Everyone was quite afraid to head back to the far off water. Days past by and slowly we could see the water in the ocean started disappearing. Everybody was in amazement, like they saw some kind of magic, but some folks knew this was just the beginning of the bad days that were about to come. As months passed, the people started becoming angry because they now had to look for food in the jungle which wasn't quite tasteful compared to seafood. The rich folks used to come visit the island jungle, too, and take whatever they pleased.. At first people let it be because they thought the resources of the jungle were in plenty. But slowly, as time passed by they too became scarce. Now people from both sides were really getting angry. Riots started breaking out around b/w rich and common folks. The people started fighting against each other. The situation got so bad that rich folks started burning the places of ordinary folks. To which people replied back by throwing rocks at the yachts. As the years passed by, only the few survived to live the tale and were able to live off of the island's scare resources. As time progressed the water in the ocean started coming back and so were resources of the island that got depleted, replenished as more folks started going around for the hunt. And hence the cycle repeated itself again for 10 or more yrs. Moral of the story : I leave it to you people to decide in the comments section. Also, the last paragraph is kinda my interpretation of what happened. I leave that up to you. Hey, maybe no one survived to live the tale. Streak of losses Recap : 16th May - 20th May The last week was pretty crazy. S&P 500 finally entered its bear market and dropped to almost -22%. whereas the Nasdaq declined about -30% making this market performance as the worst since 1931 ""Great depression"". We also had 7 straight weeks of red which is just behind the March 2001 ""Dotcom crash"" and May 1970 ""Stagflation"". Apple warning : Later i said if Apple looks bad so will Tesla. Because both are cash Hedge. As my viewers already know we talked about Apple and Tesla warning in my last post where i was worried about their charts. So it indeed happened. Apple dropped below its 100 week MA and Tesla got hammered with FUD articles. Elon Musk thinks its a ploy by democrats.. What do y'all think. Tell me about in the comments section. By the way guys I see no one in Wall street bets talk about things before 1987. Why is that ? Everyone just wants to either compare things with recent recession of 2008 or they want the 1987 ""Black Monday"" crash where DOW dropped -20% in a day. I think people are really getting tired of this constant velocity crash with no acceleration to the downside. Some Economists thinks Powell should just rug-pull and kill the economy in a day. Why to wait for 6 months when things can be done in a day. Pretty shitty argument in my opinion cause why would you want to pressure economy in just a single day. Also some other Economists are calling for retail capitulation. I have no idea guys. It could come or not come before June or July FOMC. But it sure is heck is coming in Q4. ( It will be marked by capitulation in retail stocks, ) Hedge funds top Investments I was very lucky last week to have time and watch ""Jeremy Grantham"" and ""Ray Dalio"" my two favorite logical investors together for an online video conference where they talked about their views on economy. Both of them have a pretty different outlook for the future. Ray believes the changing world order is about to happen in this cycle where the China and rest other emerging markets from Asia such as India will boom as compared to USA where we could have a bust. (But his fund has an allocation to FTSE 100. Interesting) Jeremy believes we are in for a dotcom style crash. But both of them don't believe in the idea of recession this year but yeah the risk of stagflation are increasing day by day according to them. Growth in their opinion though will be slowing in the upcoming years. Also do watch ""All in podcast"" show. In latest episode we have a guy who predicted 5 out of the last 3 recessions and invested in We work.ðŸ˜‚ Okay moving on lets summarize key highlights of this week from CNBC television : Jet blue hostile bid for spirit airlines. Boeing is shit. Elon twitter drama. Oil to $150 after china deal. Warren Buffet buying energy and increasing stake in occidental petroleum. Healthcare and energy can be defensive and aggressive play for portfolio managers this year. Netflix upgraded by a bear. Walmart & Target earnings disaster. Retail sales 0.9% est 1% in April. Job cuts in Netflix and HOOD. Hiring freeze in Facebook & COIN. Fin-tech bottom is in according to analysts. Google is good in economic slowdown. Growth scare. Long term bond buying and equities falling regardless. The White House is now looking to cut corporate greed. Looks like no more price gouging. The unhedged hedge fund Melvin capital is shutting down. You guys did it. David won against Goliath. Identify the difference b/w short covering and bear market rally. Biden meets leaders of Sweden, Finland. Meaning they are going to join NATO this year. We have Monkey pox to deal with. Twitter says it's the courtesy of Bill Gates. Auto loan delinquencies hits highest since 2007. Sam Bank-man Fried bought Robinhood. FTX is about to start stock trading. Meaning if CBDC's by government arrives then petro dollar becomes hetero dollar of trading worldwide. Where we stand Now since many of you guys are new here. Let me bore you once again. We will eventually go into b/w of forgotten depression of 1921 and full blown depression. Depression is just a longer lasting recession. Recession in my opinion will happen later in Q4 because I don't think coming GDP print will be -ve but i think next one and the next one in January will be. Hence i always say when Dow jones hits anywhere b/w 50 MMA - 200 MMA just start DCAing in index ( picking stocks is hard ) like SPX, Nasdaq, DJI. Or if you really wanna buy stocks then go ahead pick the best stocks and DCA ( no one knows the true bottom ) that will last 10yrs. And have patience and conviction. Also we have short term swing trade in indices coming up. We could do this by DCAing index in before June or July FOMC and then sell in before September arrives. You could play options or specific stocks but i wont help you with which ones. I prefer index.

Because both are cash Hedge. As my viewers already know we talked about Apple and Tesla warning in my last post where i was worried about their charts. So it indeed happened. Apple dropped below its 100 week MA and Tesla got hammered with FUD articles. Elon Musk thinks its a ploy by democrats.. What do y'all think. Tell me about in the comments section. By the way guys I see no one in Wall street bets talk about things before 1987. Why is that ? Everyone just wants to either compare things with recent recession of 2008 or they want the 1987 ""Black Monday"" crash where DOW dropped -20% in a day. I think people are really getting tired of this constant velocity crash with no acceleration to the downside. Some Economists thinks Powell should just rug-pull and kill the economy in a day. Why to wait for 6 months when things can be done in a day. Pretty shitty argument in my opinion cause why would you want to pressure economy in just a single day. Also some other Economists are calling for retail capitulation. I have no idea guys. It could come or not come before June or July FOMC. But it sure is heck is coming in Q4. ( It will be marked by capitulation in retail stocks, ) Hedge funds top Investments I was very lucky last week to have time and watch ""Jeremy Grantham"" and ""Ray Dalio"" my two favorite logical investors together for an online video conference where they talked about their views on economy. Both of them have a pretty different outlook for the future. Ray believes the changing world order is about to happen in this cycle where the China and rest other emerging markets from Asia such as India will boom as compared to USA where we could have a bust. (But his fund has an allocation to FTSE 100. Interesting) Jeremy believes we are in for a dotcom style crash. But both of them don't believe in the idea of recession this year but yeah the risk of stagflation are increasing day by day according to them. Growth in their opinion though will be slowing in the upcoming years. Also do watch ""All in podcast"" show. In latest episode we have a guy who predicted 5 out of the last 3 recessions and invested in We work.ðŸ˜‚ Okay moving on lets summarize key highlights of this week from CNBC television : Jet blue hostile bid for spirit airlines. Boeing is shit. Elon twitter drama. Oil to $150 after china deal. Warren Buffet buying energy and increasing stake in occidental petroleum. Healthcare and energy can be defensive and aggressive play for portfolio managers this year. Netflix upgraded by a bear. Walmart & Target earnings disaster. Retail sales 0.9% est 1% in April. Job cuts in Netflix and HOOD. Hiring freeze in Facebook & COIN. Fin-tech bottom is in according to analysts. Google is good in economic slowdown. Growth scare. Long term bond buying and equities falling regardless. The White House is now looking to cut corporate greed. Looks like no more price gouging. The unhedged hedge fund Melvin capital is shutting down. You guys did it. David won against Goliath. Identify the difference b/w short covering and bear market rally. Biden meets leaders of Sweden, Finland. Meaning they are going to join NATO this year. We have Monkey pox to deal with. Twitter says it's the courtesy of Bill Gates. Auto loan delinquencies hits highest since 2007. Sam Bank-man Fried bought Robinhood. FTX is about to start stock trading. Meaning if CBDC's by government arrives then petro dollar becomes hetero dollar of trading worldwide. Where we stand Now since many of you guys are new here. Let me bore you once again. We will eventually go into b/w of forgotten depression of 1921 and full blown depression. Depression is just a longer lasting recession. Recession in my opinion will happen later in Q4 because I don't think coming GDP print will be -ve but i think next one and the next one in January will be. Hence i always say when Dow jones hits anywhere b/w 50 MMA - 200 MMA just start DCAing in index ( picking stocks is hard ) like SPX, Nasdaq, DJI. Or if you really wanna buy stocks then go ahead pick the best stocks and DCA ( no one knows the true bottom ) that will last 10yrs. And have patience and conviction. Also we have short term swing trade in indices coming up. We could do this by DCAing index in before June or July FOMC and then sell in before September arrives. You could play options or specific stocks but i wont help you with which ones. I prefer index. Charts of the week Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 1 : The 10yr breakevens on the chart are first thing that tops. It tells investors inflation problem is about to happen. Then it's the inflation that starts rising. Now depending upon the inflation level the bond yields rise. More the inflation more the Fed becomes hawkish. Hence at the end its the interest rate that tops. So in a sense 10yr breakevens are the leading indicator for inflation level. Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 2 : The 40 year cycle. We already know that the stock market revolves around a cycle. The 1940 - 1980 cycle in which the bond yields made higher high's and higher low's. And then the 1980 - 2020 cycle where bond yields made a lower high's and lower low's. During the first 40 cycle the interest rate peaked before the bond yields and were more higher in number. In the next 40 cycle the interest rate peaked after the bond yields and were much lower. The Boom Bust cycles XD Observation 3 : ( Don't laugh) So everyone knows how a economy works. I have taken a segment from a way longer cycle of economics passed from generations. ( The 90yr cycle ) We have a period of boom and then we have a period of bust. The boom period from 1980-2020 is over in my opinion where the talk was about globalization Chart : Dow Jones , Orange line : Bond yields , Blue line : Inflation Observation 4 : Let's find out where in history we could be. So high inflation with low bond yields right. So it could be the 1940's or 1948 when Fed decided to kill inflation by raising rates so high that it caused a deflationary period. Result : I have no idea where are we. This experiment was for nothing or maybe it was. But we pose similarity to all of the periods. Disease | Russia wise : 1921 Forgotten depression Chart wise and cycle wise : 1929 depression. Rate, Inflation and bond wise : 1940's. News event wise : 1970's stagflation. Technology and funding wise : 2000 dotcom bubble. WSB wise : 2008 recession. Welcome to the Jungle : Its time for our portfolio building Look guys before we begin let me tell you i am not an expert of fundamental analyzing the companies. But what i am good at is knowing the narratives beforehand and combining it with my technical analysis on stock market where it is headed. But yah of course i do watch earnings and this week is gonna be awesome. Let us begin this unique way of investing. This week : Earnings + FOMC minutes. Hypothesis : If stock valuation relative to others becomes cheap then the algorithms created by big institutions and Hedge funds will buy the stock and sell it quickly or hold according to their analysts or portfolio manger if they are interesting on betting the stock for next cycle. We are going to construct the most knowable portfolio passed down by the generations before. It's called a 60-40% portfolio. But we are gonna make few adjustments to it. Equities : 60% -> 40% USA + 20% international Bonds : 40% -> 30% bonds + 10% metals. We don't take commodities because they are for trading purposes mostly. Step 1 : 10% metals Gold Silver Since we are in 1921, 1929, 1940, 1970, 2000 or 2008. what we know is gold parabolic move is sure to happen. But what we don't know is when to buy gold. We all know in financial crisis gold will fall too or when Powell goes for aggressive rate hike. But it wont capitulate like equities because gold moves slow. It's only in the parabolic moves that gold moves fast. But there are factors that causes it. So the narrative around it will surely come by 2025. Meaning. We buy some now and some portion in crisis. We will add silver too because it will move a lot if Gold goes parabolic.Kinda like how large cap help move small caps. Result : $6 Gold ( $3 right now + $3 in crisis ) + $4 Silver ( $2 right now + $2 in crisis ) Step 2 : 30% bonds. Now this thing is kinda hard to predict and is a matter of preference because there are many types of bonds available. What i will be doing is outperforming those other corporate bonds which gives high return but there are risk associated with it. This chart tell us low yield bonds are about to be bought as compared to high yield risk bonds So I picked TMF for this because i'm chasing high returns with no risk at all. Yes sure its a leveraged ETF but from this chart i know in coming few months most investors will be flocking to longer yield bonds because the growth scare hasn't yet been priced in. Hence the TMF bond will peak because of max euphoria at the end of Q4. My projection are already given in the charts. The only risk to it is change in terminal rates (3.2% aug 2023) or changing the definition of neutral.( 2-3%) TMF ( No income ) = 3 x TLT ( It gives fixed income quarterly ) Result : $15 right now in TMF + $15 ( wait for june TLT ) Step 3 : 60% Equities. Next 60% will be to equities. For this i will picking winner stock with 2025 max profits guarantees. It is up to you guys to decide which winner stock and how much should be in portfolio. And at what price levels are you comfortable with. a) Voldemort class ( These class of stocks are linked to the asset class i cannot name here because i will get banned. But hey we can name the stocks ) Includes : MTTR, MSTR, COIN, HOOD, HUT8, COIN, Winner : MTTR, COIN Reason : MSTR is bound to get liquidated since saylor is known for crisis like dotcom. HOOD c'mon guys we all hate it. Also Vlad is such a shit CEO. If he gets removed as CEO and Sam Bank man like Elon makes a play for position then heck yes. It could be proxy to investing with FTX. HUT8 hmm. I just don't like mining stocks. Matterport on the other hand has got metaverse play in it. So im expecting it to do a 8x by then and everybody loves Brian. Heck even the SEC too. He's got good leadership skills and would do anything for the company. $40 was such a good deal. Man i missed it. It was trading below its funding valuation and 2x the money they had. b) EV play. Includes : Rivian, Ford, GM, Tesla, Nio, Lucid Winner : Tesla, Nio Reason : I'm going calling the dibs on Tesla even though its price can fall to $380. Coz why won't you wanna have Tesla in your portfolio. Its still got India play left inside it. Yes supply chain are the problems but i believe this company will get help from china. Hence Nio too. So allocate some to Tesla and Nio. Nio because George Soros who broke bank of England is buying heavy. So Hf's or institutions would not even possibly think of shorting this stock. Such is the fear of Soros in Wallstreet. c) Gaming play + Chips Includes : AMD, Intel, Nvidia Winner : Nvidia ( Little partial ) Reason : I am partial to this even though AMD has started producing cheaper and better products and aren't suffering in supply chain as much. Nvidia in my opinion is world class and its products last longer than other products. Also there is a heavy demand by consumers. Nothing will ever change that. It's kinda like Apple of the space. Also its the leading in ml + ai too. I believe Tesla and Nvidia will partner in future. I could be wrong here and hey maybe AMD kicks its butt but i'm gonna go Nvidia. Also AMD has to fight some FUD articles in the future. Its up to you guys to decide. But i sure as hell don't want you to buy intel. d ) Payment play Includes : VISA, Master card, PayPal Winner : Paypal Reason :They are doing so much in Voldomort asset class. VISA wtf are you doing though by joking around with that sh9t. e ) The others Rest guys i believe in peace so no Palantir for me. And since Jamie Dimon is leaving i think JP Morgan will fall. If he stick around till 2025 then i sure as hell would keep this in my portfolio. Also i don't want Ecom in portfolio ( AMZN + Target + Walmart ) but i sure as hell want Google. Its got that growth in slowing economy factor for me. Because who forgets to search on google and play videos on Youtube. And then there is Cathie wood and her Roku. Look guys if she is doing an insider trading and knows something about the company that we don't then sure go all in on that stock only. Also remember the people who created SARKK have launched another ETF called ARKK leveraged 3x. So maybe if money flows around in it like SARKK then hey Roku gets most of the money since its her top holding. Winner : Google + Roku ( On your own level of risk ) f ) International Since China is about to stimulate its economy and Hong Kong basically is under china control then expect the popular stocks over there to grow as well. Includes : BABA, JD, Tencent Winner : BABA, Bytedance ( If it goes public ) Reason : Amazon and Target money will flow here. Also the low PE / PEG ratio is highly attractive. And hey Munger is buying alongside Blackrock and Bridgwater. Remember we chose Nio too. So keep them at 20% and divide yourselves. Note : The winner decision is solely according to me. Also i haven't given the price levels to buy. That is upto you guys to decide. This is not a Financial advise. As for the proof that i am buying here are my positions on some of the things that i went shopping around. Tesla + TMF The amount has not yet been credited yet. Result : It shall be knows until 2024-2025. Conclusion : Fuck i don't know if it will work. But hey if a monkey can beat the stock market so can this monkey too. P.s. I was quite heartbroken on Sunday so i was unable to write anything. Had to drink so much that this time that i couldn't write anything. Liverpool lost the EPL guys. We came so close. Had the Villa hold on for 20 more minutes what a script it would have been. Felt bad for that goalie though and Gerrard. Imagine slipping twice. Next week we kick Real ass in UCL. (Post Hang over post ) With lots of love guys. Thank you. Regards Uchiha",Thank you for posting.,0,0.497,POSITIVE,0.783
,"Respected Traders & Investors, I know folks, it's hard. Just hang on for a few more weeks. Okay!!! A fake exit liquidity rally like March FOMC is just around the corner. So please bear with me. I know times are tough, but guys, we have gotta dig deep and stick around. Until then let's have some fun creating a portfolio. A BS story from my dreams. Might as well skip it. ( Especially Tl;Dr folks ) Story about an island doom. Before we begin creating our portfolio, let me tell you all a story. It goes like there was an island in the middle of a huge ocean where everybody was having a blast. Rich people bought their yachts and the common folks brought their gondola boats. Everyday, the rich and common people used to boat around from the island shore to the middle of the ocean for food. The rich guys used their expensive equipment while the common folks used the traditional method of net for hunt. After everyone was done with their hunting, they used to head back to the island. As the night came down, the rich folks partied on their yachts, while the common folks used to party on the island itself and hence sleep in the stone cave passed by generations. As the days continued by, the people now had to go a little further from the day before because they weren't a lot of things left to hunt in the regions they used to before. As they were going far into the ocean, people started seeing many whales emerging from beneath the ocean. They looked kinda sick because they weren't moving a lot. No one knew the reason why they were slowly dying. Some folks saw this as a warning sign so they took off back to their island. But the rich folks didn't care, and so did some common folks. As the day passed by sharks started appearing in one's, two's and three's, and so on. With passing of each day there were more sharks than the previous one. They used to come for those whales and then leave. Slowly, all the whales disappeared, and hence the sharks too. Everyone thought it was all back to normal, so they continued with their hunting. But then came that fateful day when a swarm of sharks, which looked so hungry, started attacking the people in boats. Heck, there were some big hungry sharks that they even attacked the rick folks yacht. So both the common and rich folks tried to boat around back to the island for safety, but they had come so far off this time around. The yachts, though, were fast so they came back quickly, but the gondola boats were slow. Only the few lucky ones survived. It was all silence on the island. Everyone was quite afraid to head back to the far off water. Days past by and slowly we could see the water in the ocean started disappearing. Everybody was in amazement, like they saw some kind of magic, but some folks knew this was just the beginning of the bad days that were about to come. As months passed, the people started becoming angry because they now had to look for food in the jungle which wasn't quite tasteful compared to seafood. The rich folks used to come visit the island jungle, too, and take whatever they pleased.. At first people let it be because they thought the resources of the jungle were in plenty. But slowly, as time passed by they too became scarce. Now people from both sides were really getting angry. Riots started breaking out around b/w rich and common folks. The people started fighting against each other. The situation got so bad that rich folks started burning the places of ordinary folks. To which people replied back by throwing rocks at the yachts. As the years passed by, only the few survived to live the tale and were able to live off of the island's scare resources. As time progressed the water in the ocean started coming back and so were resources of the island that got depleted, replenished as more folks started going around for the hunt. And hence the cycle repeated itself again for 10 or more yrs. Moral of the story : I leave it to you people to decide in the comments section. Also, the last paragraph is kinda my interpretation of what happened. I leave that up to you. Hey, maybe no one survived to live the tale. Streak of losses Recap : 16th May - 20th May The last week was pretty crazy. S&P 500 finally entered its bear market and dropped to almost -22%. whereas the Nasdaq declined about -30% making this market performance as the worst since 1931 ""Great depression"".

I was quite heartbroken on Sunday so i was unable to write anything. Had to drink so much that this time that i couldn't write anything. Liverpool lost the EPL guys. We came so close. Had the Villa hold on for 20 more minutes what a script it would have been. Felt bad for that goalie though and Gerrard. Imagine slipping twice. Next week we kick Real ass in UCL.

,"Respected Traders & Investors, I know folks, it's hard. Just hang on for a few more weeks. Okay!!! A fake exit liquidity rally like March FOMC is just around the corner. So please bear with me. I know times are tough, but guys, we have gotta dig deep and stick around. Until then let's have some fun creating a portfolio. A BS story from my dreams. Might as well skip it. ( Especially Tl;Dr folks ) Story about an island doom. Before we begin creating our portfolio, let me tell you all a story. It goes like there was an island in the middle of a huge ocean where everybody was having a blast. Rich people bought their yachts and the common folks brought their gondola boats. Everyday, the rich and common people used to boat around from the island shore to the middle of the ocean for food. The rich guys used their expensive equipment while the common folks used the traditional method of net for hunt. After everyone was done with their hunting, they used to head back to the island. As the night came down, the rich folks partied on their yachts, while the common folks used to party on the island itself and hence sleep in the stone cave passed by generations. As the days continued by, the people now had to go a little further from the day before because they weren't a lot of things left to hunt in the regions they used to before. As they were going far into the ocean, people started seeing many whales emerging from beneath the ocean. They looked kinda sick because they weren't moving a lot. No one knew the reason why they were slowly dying. Some folks saw this as a warning sign so they took off back to their island. But the rich folks didn't care, and so did some common folks. As the day passed by sharks started appearing in one's, two's and three's, and so on. With passing of each day there were more sharks than the previous one. They used to come for those whales and then leave. Slowly, all the whales disappeared, and hence the sharks too. Everyone thought it was all back to normal, so they continued with their hunting. But then came that fateful day when a swarm of sharks, which looked so hungry, started attacking the people in boats. Heck, there were some big hungry sharks that they even attacked the rick folks yacht. So both the common and rich folks tried to boat around back to the island for safety, but they had come so far off this time around. The yachts, though, were fast so they came back quickly, but the gondola boats were slow. Only the few lucky ones survived. It was all silence on the island. Everyone was quite afraid to head back to the far off water. Days past by and slowly we could see the water in the ocean started disappearing. Everybody was in amazement, like they saw some kind of magic, but some folks knew this was just the beginning of the bad days that were about to come. As months passed, the people started becoming angry because they now had to look for food in the jungle which wasn't quite tasteful compared to seafood. The rich folks used to come visit the island jungle, too, and take whatever they pleased.. At first people let it be because they thought the resources of the jungle were in plenty. But slowly, as time passed by they too became scarce. Now people from both sides were really getting angry. Riots started breaking out around b/w rich and common folks. The people started fighting against each other. The situation got so bad that rich folks started burning the places of ordinary folks. To which people replied back by throwing rocks at the yachts. As the years passed by, only the few survived to live the tale and were able to live off of the island's scare resources. As time progressed the water in the ocean started coming back and so were resources of the island that got depleted, replenished as more folks started going around for the hunt. And hence the cycle repeated itself again for 10 or more yrs. Moral of the story : I leave it to you people to decide in the comments section. Also, the last paragraph is kinda my interpretation of what happened. I leave that up to you. Hey, maybe no one survived to live the tale. Streak of losses Recap : 16th May - 20th May The last week was pretty crazy. S&P 500 finally entered its bear market and dropped to almost -22%. whereas the Nasdaq declined about -30% making this market performance as the worst since 1931 ""Great depression"". We also had 7 straight weeks of red which is just behind the March 2001 ""Dotcom crash"" and May 1970 ""Stagflation"". Apple warning : Later i said if Apple looks bad so will Tesla. Because both are cash Hedge. As my viewers already know we talked about Apple and Tesla warning in my last post where i was worried about their charts. So it indeed happened. Apple dropped below its 100 week MA and Tesla got hammered with FUD articles. Elon Musk thinks its a ploy by democrats.. What do y'all think. Tell me about in the comments section. By the way guys I see no one in Wall street bets talk about things before 1987. Why is that ? Everyone just wants to either compare things with recent recession of 2008 or they want the 1987 ""Black Monday"" crash where DOW dropped -20% in a day. I think people are really getting tired of this constant velocity crash with no acceleration to the downside. Some Economists thinks Powell should just rug-pull and kill the economy in a day. Why to wait for 6 months when things can be done in a day. Pretty shitty argument in my opinion cause why would you want to pressure economy in just a single day. Also some other Economists are calling for retail capitulation. I have no idea guys. It could come or not come before June or July FOMC. But it sure is heck is coming in Q4. ( It will be marked by capitulation in retail stocks, ) Hedge funds top Investments I was very lucky last week to have time and watch ""Jeremy Grantham"" and ""Ray Dalio"" my two favorite logical investors together for an online video conference where they talked about their views on economy. Both of them have a pretty different outlook for the future. Ray believes the changing world order is about to happen in this cycle where the China and rest other emerging markets from Asia such as India will boom as compared to USA where we could have a bust. (But his fund has an allocation to FTSE 100. Interesting) Jeremy believes we are in for a dotcom style crash. But both of them don't believe in the idea of recession this year but yeah the risk of stagflation are increasing day by day according to them. Growth in their opinion though will be slowing in the upcoming years. Also do watch ""All in podcast"" show. In latest episode we have a guy who predicted 5 out of the last 3 recessions and invested in We work.ðŸ˜‚ Okay moving on lets summarize key highlights of this week from CNBC television : Jet blue hostile bid for spirit airlines. Boeing is shit. Elon twitter drama. Oil to $150 after china deal. Warren Buffet buying energy and increasing stake in occidental petroleum. Healthcare and energy can be defensive and aggressive play for portfolio managers this year. Netflix upgraded by a bear. Walmart & Target earnings disaster. Retail sales 0.9% est 1% in April. Job cuts in Netflix and HOOD. Hiring freeze in Facebook & COIN. Fin-tech bottom is in according to analysts. Google is good in economic slowdown. Growth scare. Long term bond buying and equities falling regardless. The White House is now looking to cut corporate greed. Looks like no more price gouging. The unhedged hedge fund Melvin capital is shutting down. You guys did it. David won against Goliath. Identify the difference b/w short covering and bear market rally. Biden meets leaders of Sweden, Finland. Meaning they are going to join NATO this year. We have Monkey pox to deal with. Twitter says it's the courtesy of Bill Gates. Auto loan delinquencies hits highest since 2007. Sam Bank-man Fried bought Robinhood. FTX is about to start stock trading. Meaning if CBDC's by government arrives then petro dollar becomes hetero dollar of trading worldwide. Where we stand Now since many of you guys are new here. Let me bore you once again. We will eventually go into b/w of forgotten depression of 1921 and full blown depression. Depression is just a longer lasting recession. Recession in my opinion will happen later in Q4 because I don't think coming GDP print will be -ve but i think next one and the next one in January will be. Hence i always say when Dow jones hits anywhere b/w 50 MMA - 200 MMA just start DCAing in index ( picking stocks is hard ) like SPX, Nasdaq, DJI. Or if you really wanna buy stocks then go ahead pick the best stocks and DCA ( no one knows the true bottom ) that will last 10yrs. And have patience and conviction. Also we have short term swing trade in indices coming up. We could do this by DCAing index in before June or July FOMC and then sell in before September arrives. You could play options or specific stocks but i wont help you with which ones. I prefer index. Charts of the week Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 1 : The 10yr breakevens on the chart are first thing that tops. It tells investors inflation problem is about to happen. Then it's the inflation that starts rising. Now depending upon the inflation level the bond yields rise. More the inflation more the Fed becomes hawkish. Hence at the end its the interest rate that tops. So in a sense 10yr breakevens are the leading indicator for inflation level. Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 2 : The 40 year cycle. We already know that the stock market revolves around a cycle. The 1940 - 1980 cycle in which the bond yields made higher high's and higher low's. And then the 1980 - 2020 cycle where bond yields made a lower high's and lower low's. During the first 40 cycle the interest rate peaked before the bond yields and were more higher in number. In the next 40 cycle the interest rate peaked after the bond yields and were much lower. The Boom Bust cycles XD Observation 3 : ( Don't laugh) So everyone knows how a economy works. I have taken a segment from a way longer cycle of economics passed from generations. ( The 90yr cycle ) We have a period of boom and then we have a period of bust. The boom period from 1980-2020 is over in my opinion where the talk was about globalization Chart : Dow Jones , Orange line : Bond yields , Blue line : Inflation Observation 4 : Let's find out where in history we could be. So high inflation with low bond yields right. So it could be the 1940's or 1948 when Fed decided to kill inflation by raising rates so high that it caused a deflationary period. Result : I have no idea where are we. This experiment was for nothing or maybe it was. But we pose similarity to all of the periods. Disease | Russia wise : 1921 Forgotten depression Chart wise and cycle wise : 1929 depression. Rate, Inflation and bond wise : 1940's. News event wise : 1970's stagflation. Technology and funding wise : 2000 dotcom bubble. WSB wise : 2008 recession. Welcome to the Jungle : Its time for our portfolio building Look guys before we begin let me tell you i am not an expert of fundamental analyzing the companies. But what i am good at is knowing the narratives beforehand and combining it with my technical analysis on stock market where it is headed. But yah of course i do watch earnings and this week is gonna be awesome. Let us begin this unique way of investing. This week : Earnings + FOMC minutes. Hypothesis : If stock valuation relative to others becomes cheap then the algorithms created by big institutions and Hedge funds will buy the stock and sell it quickly or hold according to their analysts or portfolio manger if they are interesting on betting the stock for next cycle. We are going to construct the most knowable portfolio passed down by the generations before. It's called a 60-40% portfolio. But we are gonna make few adjustments to it. Equities : 60% -> 40% USA + 20% international Bonds : 40% -> 30% bonds + 10% metals. We don't take commodities because they are for trading purposes mostly. Step 1 : 10% metals Gold Silver Since we are in 1921, 1929, 1940, 1970, 2000 or 2008. what we know is gold parabolic move is sure to happen. But what we don't know is when to buy gold. We all know in financial crisis gold will fall too or when Powell goes for aggressive rate hike. But it wont capitulate like equities because gold moves slow. It's only in the parabolic moves that gold moves fast. But there are factors that causes it. So the narrative around it will surely come by 2025. Meaning. We buy some now and some portion in crisis. We will add silver too because it will move a lot if Gold goes parabolic.Kinda like how large cap help move small caps. Result : $6 Gold ( $3 right now + $3 in crisis ) + $4 Silver ( $2 right now + $2 in crisis ) Step 2 : 30% bonds. Now this thing is kinda hard to predict and is a matter of preference because there are many types of bonds available. What i will be doing is outperforming those other corporate bonds which gives high return but there are risk associated with it. This chart tell us low yield bonds are about to be bought as compared to high yield risk bonds So I picked TMF for this because i'm chasing high returns with no risk at all. Yes sure its a leveraged ETF but from this chart i know in coming few months most investors will be flocking to longer yield bonds because the growth scare hasn't yet been priced in. Hence the TMF bond will peak because of max euphoria at the end of Q4. My projection are already given in the charts. The only risk to it is change in terminal rates (3.2% aug 2023) or changing the definition of neutral.( 2-3%) TMF ( No income ) = 3 x TLT ( It gives fixed income quarterly ) Result : $15 right now in TMF + $15 ( wait for june TLT ) Step 3 : 60% Equities. Next 60% will be to equities. For this i will picking winner stock with 2025 max profits guarantees. It is up to you guys to decide which winner stock and how much should be in portfolio. And at what price levels are you comfortable with. a) Voldemort class ( These class of stocks are linked to the asset class i cannot name here because i will get banned. But hey we can name the stocks ) Includes : MTTR, MSTR, COIN, HOOD, HUT8, COIN, Winner : MTTR, COIN Reason : MSTR is bound to get liquidated since saylor is known for crisis like dotcom. HOOD c'mon guys we all hate it. Also Vlad is such a shit CEO. If he gets removed as CEO and Sam Bank man like Elon makes a play for position then heck yes. It could be proxy to investing with FTX. HUT8 hmm. I just don't like mining stocks. Matterport on the other hand has got metaverse play in it. So im expecting it to do a 8x by then and everybody loves Brian. Heck even the SEC too. He's got good leadership skills and would do anything for the company. $40 was such a good deal. Man i missed it. It was trading below its funding valuation and 2x the money they had. b) EV play. Includes : Rivian, Ford, GM, Tesla, Nio, Lucid Winner : Tesla, Nio Reason : I'm going calling the dibs on Tesla even though its price can fall to $380. Coz why won't you wanna have Tesla in your portfolio. Its still got India play left inside it. Yes supply chain are the problems but i believe this company will get help from china. Hence Nio too. So allocate some to Tesla and Nio. Nio because George Soros who broke bank of England is buying heavy. So Hf's or institutions would not even possibly think of shorting this stock. Such is the fear of Soros in Wallstreet. c) Gaming play + Chips Includes : AMD, Intel, Nvidia Winner : Nvidia ( Little partial ) Reason : I am partial to this even though AMD has started producing cheaper and better products and aren't suffering in supply chain as much. Nvidia in my opinion is world class and its products last longer than other products. Also there is a heavy demand by consumers. Nothing will ever change that. It's kinda like Apple of the space. Also its the leading in ml + ai too. I believe Tesla and Nvidia will partner in future. I could be wrong here and hey maybe AMD kicks its butt but i'm gonna go Nvidia. Also AMD has to fight some FUD articles in the future. Its up to you guys to decide. But i sure as hell don't want you to buy intel. d ) Payment play Includes : VISA, Master card, PayPal Winner : Paypal Reason :They are doing so much in Voldomort asset class. VISA wtf are you doing though by joking around with that sh9t. e ) The others Rest guys i believe in peace so no Palantir for me. And since Jamie Dimon is leaving i think JP Morgan will fall. If he stick around till 2025 then i sure as hell would keep this in my portfolio. Also i don't want Ecom in portfolio ( AMZN + Target + Walmart ) but i sure as hell want Google. Its got that growth in slowing economy factor for me. Because who forgets to search on google and play videos on Youtube. And then there is Cathie wood and her Roku. Look guys if she is doing an insider trading and knows something about the company that we don't then sure go all in on that stock only. Also remember the people who created SARKK have launched another ETF called ARKK leveraged 3x. So maybe if money flows around in it like SARKK then hey Roku gets most of the money since its her top holding. Winner : Google + Roku ( On your own level of risk ) f ) International Since China is about to stimulate its economy and Hong Kong basically is under china control then expect the popular stocks over there to grow as well. Includes : BABA, JD, Tencent Winner : BABA, Bytedance ( If it goes public ) Reason : Amazon and Target money will flow here. Also the low PE / PEG ratio is highly attractive. And hey Munger is buying alongside Blackrock and Bridgwater. Remember we chose Nio too. So keep them at 20% and divide yourselves. Note : The winner decision is solely according to me. Also i haven't given the price levels to buy. That is upto you guys to decide. This is not a Financial advise. As for the proof that i am buying here are my positions on some of the things that i went shopping around. Tesla + TMF The amount has not yet been credited yet. Result : It shall be knows until 2024-2025. Conclusion : Fuck i don't know if it will work. But hey if a monkey can beat the stock market so can this monkey too. P.s. I was quite heartbroken on Sunday so i was unable to write anything. Had to drink so much that this time that i couldn't write anything. Liverpool lost the EPL guys. We came so close. Had the Villa hold on for 20 more minutes what a script it would have been. Felt bad for that goalie though and Gerrard. Imagine slipping twice. Next week we kick Real ass in UCL.

The only risk to it is change in terminal rates (3.2% aug 2023) or changing the definition of neutral.( 2-3%) TMF ( No income ) = 3 x TLT ( It gives fixed income quarterly ) Result : $15 right now in TMF + $15 ( wait for june TLT ) Step 3 : 60% Equities. Next 60% will be to equities. For this i will picking winner stock with 2025 max profits guarantees. It is up to you guys to decide which winner stock and how much should be in portfolio. And at what price levels are you comfortable with. a) Voldemort class ( These class of stocks are linked to the asset class i cannot name here because i will get banned. But hey we can name the stocks ) Includes : MTTR, MSTR, COIN, HOOD, HUT8, COIN, Winner : MTTR, COIN Reason : MSTR is bound to get liquidated since saylor is known for crisis like dotcom. HOOD c'mon guys we all hate it. Also Vlad is such a shit CEO. If he gets removed as CEO and Sam Bank man like Elon makes a play for position then heck yes. It could be proxy to investing with FTX. HUT8 hmm. I just don't like mining stocks. Matterport on the other hand has got metaverse play in it. So im expecting it to do a 8x by then and everybody loves Brian. Heck even the SEC too. He's got good leadership skills and would do anything for the company. $40 was such a good deal. Man i missed it. It was trading below its funding valuation and 2x the money they had. b) EV play. Includes : Rivian, Ford, GM, Tesla, Nio, Lucid Winner : Tesla, Nio Reason : I'm going calling the dibs on Tesla even though its price can fall to $380. Coz why won't you wanna have Tesla in your portfolio. Its still got India play left inside it. Yes supply chain are the problems but i believe this company will get help from china. Hence Nio too. So allocate some to Tesla and Nio. Nio because George Soros who broke bank of England is buying heavy. So Hf's or institutions would not even possibly think of shorting this stock. Such is the fear of Soros in Wallstreet. c) Gaming play + Chips Includes : AMD, Intel, Nvidia Winner : Nvidia ( Little partial ) Reason : I am partial to this even though AMD has started producing cheaper and better products and aren't suffering in supply chain as much. Nvidia in my opinion is world class and its products last longer than other products. Also there is a heavy demand by consumers. Nothing will ever change that. It's kinda like Apple of the space. Also its the leading in ml + ai too. I believe Tesla and Nvidia will partner in future. I could be wrong here and hey maybe AMD kicks its butt but i'm gonna go Nvidia. Also AMD has to fight some FUD articles in the future. Its up to you guys to decide. But i sure as hell don't want you to buy intel. d ) Payment play Includes : VISA, Master card, PayPal Winner : Paypal Reason :They are doing so much in Voldomort asset class. VISA wtf are you doing though by joking around with that sh9t. e ) The others Rest guys i believe in peace so no Palantir for me. And since Jamie Dimon is leaving i think JP Morgan will fall. If he stick around till 2025 then i sure as hell would keep this in my portfolio. Also i don't want Ecom in portfolio ( AMZN + Target + Walmart ) but i sure as hell want Google. Its got that growth in slowing economy factor for me. Because who forgets to search on google and play videos on Youtube. And then there is Cathie wood and her Roku. Look guys if she is doing an insider trading and knows something about the company that we don't then sure go all in on that stock only. Also remember the people who created SARKK have launched another ETF called ARKK leveraged 3x. So maybe if money flows around in it like SARKK then hey Roku gets most of the money since its her top holding. Winner : Google + Roku ( On your own level of risk ) f ) International Since China is about to stimulate its economy and Hong Kong basically is under china control then expect the popular stocks over there to grow as well. Includes : BABA, JD, Tencent Winner : BABA, Bytedance ( If it goes public ) Reason : Amazon and Target money will flow here. Also the low PE / PEG ratio is highly attractive. And hey Munger is buying alongside Blackrock and Bridgwater. Remember we chose Nio too. So keep them at 20% and divide yourselves. Note : The winner decision is solely according to me. Also i haven't given the price levels to buy. That is upto you guys to decide. This is not a Financial advise. As for the proof that i am buying here are my positions on some of the things that i went shopping around. Tesla + TMF The amount has not yet been credited yet. Result : It shall be knows until 2024-2025. Conclusion : Fuck i don't know if it will work. But hey if a monkey can beat the stock market so can this monkey too. P.s. I was quite heartbroken on Sunday so i was unable to write anything. Had to drink so much that this time that i couldn't write anything. Liverpool lost the EPL guys. We came so close. Had the Villa hold on for 20 more minutes what a script it would have been. Felt bad for that goalie though and Gerrard. Imagine slipping twice. Next week we kick Real ass in UCL.

,"Respected Traders & Investors, I know folks, it's hard. Just hang on for a few more weeks. Okay!!! A fake exit liquidity rally like March FOMC is just around the corner. So please bear with me. I know times are tough, but guys, we have gotta dig deep and stick around. Until then let's have some fun creating a portfolio. A BS story from my dreams. Might as well skip it. ( Especially Tl;Dr folks ) Story about an island doom. Before we begin creating our portfolio, let me tell you all a story. It goes like there was an island in the middle of a huge ocean where everybody was having a blast. Rich people bought their yachts and the common folks brought their gondola boats. Everyday, the rich and common people used to boat around from the island shore to the middle of the ocean for food. The rich guys used their expensive equipment while the common folks used the traditional method of net for hunt. After everyone was done with their hunting, they used to head back to the island. As the night came down, the rich folks partied on their yachts, while the common folks used to party on the island itself and hence sleep in the stone cave passed by generations. As the days continued by, the people now had to go a little further from the day before because they weren't a lot of things left to hunt in the regions they used to before. As they were going far into the ocean, people started seeing many whales emerging from beneath the ocean. They looked kinda sick because they weren't moving a lot. No one knew the reason why they were slowly dying. Some folks saw this as a warning sign so they took off back to their island. But the rich folks didn't care, and so did some common folks. As the day passed by sharks started appearing in one's, two's and three's, and so on. With passing of each day there were more sharks than the previous one. They used to come for those whales and then leave. Slowly, all the whales disappeared, and hence the sharks too. Everyone thought it was all back to normal, so they continued with their hunting. But then came that fateful day when a swarm of sharks, which looked so hungry, started attacking the people in boats. Heck, there were some big hungry sharks that they even attacked the rick folks yacht. So both the common and rich folks tried to boat around back to the island for safety, but they had come so far off this time around. The yachts, though, were fast so they came back quickly, but the gondola boats were slow. Only the few lucky ones survived. It was all silence on the island. Everyone was quite afraid to head back to the far off water. Days past by and slowly we could see the water in the ocean started disappearing. Everybody was in amazement, like they saw some kind of magic, but some folks knew this was just the beginning of the bad days that were about to come. As months passed, the people started becoming angry because they now had to look for food in the jungle which wasn't quite tasteful compared to seafood. The rich folks used to come visit the island jungle, too, and take whatever they pleased.. At first people let it be because they thought the resources of the jungle were in plenty. But slowly, as time passed by they too became scarce. Now people from both sides were really getting angry. Riots started breaking out around b/w rich and common folks. The people started fighting against each other. The situation got so bad that rich folks started burning the places of ordinary folks. To which people replied back by throwing rocks at the yachts. As the years passed by, only the few survived to live the tale and were able to live off of the island's scare resources. As time progressed the water in the ocean started coming back and so were resources of the island that got depleted, replenished as more folks started going around for the hunt. And hence the cycle repeated itself again for 10 or more yrs. Moral of the story : I leave it to you people to decide in the comments section. Also, the last paragraph is kinda my interpretation of what happened. I leave that up to you. Hey, maybe no one survived to live the tale. Streak of losses Recap : 16th May - 20th May The last week was pretty crazy. S&P 500 finally entered its bear market and dropped to almost -22%. whereas the Nasdaq declined about -30% making this market performance as the worst since 1931 ""Great depression"". We also had 7 straight weeks of red which is just behind the March 2001 ""Dotcom crash"" and May 1970 ""Stagflation"". Apple warning : Later i said if Apple looks bad so will Tesla. Because both are cash Hedge. As my viewers already know we talked about Apple and Tesla warning in my last post where i was worried about their charts. So it indeed happened. Apple dropped below its 100 week MA and Tesla got hammered with FUD articles. Elon Musk thinks its a ploy by democrats.. What do y'all think. Tell me about in the comments section. By the way guys I see no one in Wall street bets talk about things before 1987. Why is that ? Everyone just wants to either compare things with recent recession of 2008 or they want the 1987 ""Black Monday"" crash where DOW dropped -20% in a day. I think people are really getting tired of this constant velocity crash with no acceleration to the downside. Some Economists thinks Powell should just rug-pull and kill the economy in a day. Why to wait for 6 months when things can be done in a day. Pretty shitty argument in my opinion cause why would you want to pressure economy in just a single day. Also some other Economists are calling for retail capitulation. I have no idea guys. It could come or not come before June or July FOMC. But it sure is heck is coming in Q4. ( It will be marked by capitulation in retail stocks, ) Hedge funds top Investments I was very lucky last week to have time and watch ""Jeremy Grantham"" and ""Ray Dalio"" my two favorite logical investors together for an online video conference where they talked about their views on economy. Both of them have a pretty different outlook for the future. Ray believes the changing world order is about to happen in this cycle where the China and rest other emerging markets from Asia such as India will boom as compared to USA where we could have a bust. (But his fund has an allocation to FTSE 100. Interesting) Jeremy believes we are in for a dotcom style crash. But both of them don't believe in the idea of recession this year but yeah the risk of stagflation are increasing day by day according to them. Growth in their opinion though will be slowing in the upcoming years. Also do watch ""All in podcast"" show. In latest episode we have a guy who predicted 5 out of the last 3 recessions and invested in We work.ðŸ˜‚ Okay moving on lets summarize key highlights of this week from CNBC television : Jet blue hostile bid for spirit airlines. Boeing is shit. Elon twitter drama. Oil to $150 after china deal. Warren Buffet buying energy and increasing stake in occidental petroleum. Healthcare and energy can be defensive and aggressive play for portfolio managers this year. Netflix upgraded by a bear. Walmart & Target earnings disaster. Retail sales 0.9% est 1% in April. Job cuts in Netflix and HOOD. Hiring freeze in Facebook & COIN. Fin-tech bottom is in according to analysts. Google is good in economic slowdown. Growth scare. Long term bond buying and equities falling regardless. The White House is now looking to cut corporate greed. Looks like no more price gouging. The unhedged hedge fund Melvin capital is shutting down. You guys did it. David won against Goliath. Identify the difference b/w short covering and bear market rally. Biden meets leaders of Sweden, Finland. Meaning they are going to join NATO this year. We have Monkey pox to deal with. Twitter says it's the courtesy of Bill Gates. Auto loan delinquencies hits highest since 2007. Sam Bank-man Fried bought Robinhood. FTX is about to start stock trading. Meaning if CBDC's by government arrives then petro dollar becomes hetero dollar of trading worldwide. Where we stand Now since many of you guys are new here. Let me bore you once again. We will eventually go into b/w of forgotten depression of 1921 and full blown depression. Depression is just a longer lasting recession. Recession in my opinion will happen later in Q4 because I don't think coming GDP print will be -ve but i think next one and the next one in January will be. Hence i always say when Dow jones hits anywhere b/w 50 MMA - 200 MMA just start DCAing in index ( picking stocks is hard ) like SPX, Nasdaq, DJI. Or if you really wanna buy stocks then go ahead pick the best stocks and DCA ( no one knows the true bottom ) that will last 10yrs. And have patience and conviction. Also we have short term swing trade in indices coming up. We could do this by DCAing index in before June or July FOMC and then sell in before September arrives. You could play options or specific stocks but i wont help you with which ones. I prefer index. Charts of the week Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 1 : The 10yr breakevens on the chart are first thing that tops. It tells investors inflation problem is about to happen. Then it's the inflation that starts rising. Now depending upon the inflation level the bond yields rise. More the inflation more the Fed becomes hawkish. Hence at the end its the interest rate that tops. So in a sense 10yr breakevens are the leading indicator for inflation level. Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 2 : The 40 year cycle. We already know that the stock market revolves around a cycle. The 1940 - 1980 cycle in which the bond yields made higher high's and higher low's. And then the 1980 - 2020 cycle where bond yields made a lower high's and lower low's. During the first 40 cycle the interest rate peaked before the bond yields and were more higher in number. In the next 40 cycle the interest rate peaked after the bond yields and were much lower. The Boom Bust cycles XD Observation 3 : ( Don't laugh) So everyone knows how a economy works. I have taken a segment from a way longer cycle of economics passed from generations. ( The 90yr cycle ) We have a period of boom and then we have a period of bust. The boom period from 1980-2020 is over in my opinion where the talk was about globalization Chart : Dow Jones , Orange line : Bond yields , Blue line : Inflation Observation 4 : Let's find out where in history we could be. So high inflation with low bond yields right. So it could be the 1940's or 1948 when Fed decided to kill inflation by raising rates so high that it caused a deflationary period. Result : I have no idea where are we. This experiment was for nothing or maybe it was. But we pose similarity to all of the periods. Disease | Russia wise : 1921 Forgotten depression Chart wise and cycle wise : 1929 depression. Rate, Inflation and bond wise : 1940's. News event wise : 1970's stagflation. Technology and funding wise : 2000 dotcom bubble. WSB wise : 2008 recession. Welcome to the Jungle : Its time for our portfolio building Look guys before we begin let me tell you i am not an expert of fundamental analyzing the companies. But what i am good at is knowing the narratives beforehand and combining it with my technical analysis on stock market where it is headed. But yah of course i do watch earnings and this week is gonna be awesome. Let us begin this unique way of investing. This week : Earnings + FOMC minutes. Hypothesis : If stock valuation relative to others becomes cheap then the algorithms created by big institutions and Hedge funds will buy the stock and sell it quickly or hold according to their analysts or portfolio manger if they are interesting on betting the stock for next cycle. We are going to construct the most knowable portfolio passed down by the generations before. It's called a 60-40% portfolio. But we are gonna make few adjustments to it. Equities : 60% -> 40% USA + 20% international Bonds : 40% -> 30% bonds + 10% metals. We don't take commodities because they are for trading purposes mostly. Step 1 : 10% metals Gold Silver Since we are in 1921, 1929, 1940, 1970, 2000 or 2008. what we know is gold parabolic move is sure to happen. But what we don't know is when to buy gold. We all know in financial crisis gold will fall too or when Powell goes for aggressive rate hike. But it wont capitulate like equities because gold moves slow. It's only in the parabolic moves that gold moves fast. But there are factors that causes it. So the narrative around it will surely come by 2025. Meaning. We buy some now and some portion in crisis. We will add silver too because it will move a lot if Gold goes parabolic.Kinda like how large cap help move small caps. Result : $6 Gold ( $3 right now + $3 in crisis ) + $4 Silver ( $2 right now + $2 in crisis ) Step 2 : 30% bonds. Now this thing is kinda hard to predict and is a matter of preference because there are many types of bonds available. What i will be doing is outperforming those other corporate bonds which gives high return but there are risk associated with it. This chart tell us low yield bonds are about to be bought as compared to high yield risk bonds So I picked TMF for this because i'm chasing high returns with no risk at all. Yes sure its a leveraged ETF but from this chart i know in coming few months most investors will be flocking to longer yield bonds because the growth scare hasn't yet been priced in. Hence the TMF bond will peak because of max euphoria at the end of Q4. My projection are already given in the charts. The only risk to it is change in terminal rates (3.2% aug 2023) or changing the definition of neutral.( 2-3%) TMF ( No income ) = 3 x TLT ( It gives fixed income quarterly ) Result : $15 right now in TMF + $15 ( wait for june TLT ) Step 3 : 60% Equities. Next 60% will be to equities. For this i will picking winner stock with 2025 max profits guarantees. It is up to you guys to decide which winner stock and how much should be in portfolio. And at what price levels are you comfortable with. a) Voldemort class ( These class of stocks are linked to the asset class i cannot name here because i will get banned.

Charts of the week Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 1 : The 10yr breakevens on the chart are first thing that tops. It tells investors inflation problem is about to happen. Then it's the inflation that starts rising. Now depending upon the inflation level the bond yields rise. More the inflation more the Fed becomes hawkish. Hence at the end its the interest rate that tops. So in a sense 10yr breakevens are the leading indicator for inflation level. Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 2 : The 40 year cycle. We already know that the stock market revolves around a cycle. The 1940 - 1980 cycle in which the bond yields made higher high's and higher low's. And then the 1980 - 2020 cycle where bond yields made a lower high's and lower low's. During the first 40 cycle the interest rate peaked before the bond yields and were more higher in number. In the next 40 cycle the interest rate peaked after the bond yields and were much lower. The Boom Bust cycles XD Observation 3 : ( Don't laugh) So everyone knows how a economy works. I have taken a segment from a way longer cycle of economics passed from generations. ( The 90yr cycle ) We have a period of boom and then we have a period of bust. The boom period from 1980-2020 is over in my opinion where the talk was about globalization Chart : Dow Jones , Orange line : Bond yields , Blue line : Inflation Observation 4 : Let's find out where in history we could be. So high inflation with low bond yields right. So it could be the 1940's or 1948 when Fed decided to kill inflation by raising rates so high that it caused a deflationary period. Result : I have no idea where are we. This experiment was for nothing or maybe it was. But we pose similarity to all of the periods. Disease | Russia wise : 1921 Forgotten depression Chart wise and cycle wise : 1929 depression. Rate, Inflation and bond wise : 1940's. News event wise : 1970's stagflation. Technology and funding wise : 2000 dotcom bubble. WSB wise : 2008 recession. Welcome to the Jungle : Its time for our portfolio building Look guys before we begin let me tell you i am not an expert of fundamental analyzing the companies. But what i am good at is knowing the narratives beforehand and combining it with my technical analysis on stock market where it is headed. But yah of course i do watch earnings and this week is gonna be awesome. Let us begin this unique way of investing. This week : Earnings + FOMC minutes. Hypothesis : If stock valuation relative to others becomes cheap then the algorithms created by big institutions and Hedge funds will buy the stock and sell it quickly or hold according to their analysts or portfolio manger if they are interesting on betting the stock for next cycle. We are going to construct the most knowable portfolio passed down by the generations before. It's called a 60-40% portfolio. But we are gonna make few adjustments to it. Equities : 60% -> 40% USA + 20% international Bonds : 40% -> 30% bonds + 10% metals. We don't take commodities because they are for trading purposes mostly. Step 1 : 10% metals Gold Silver Since we are in 1921, 1929, 1940, 1970, 2000 or 2008. what we know is gold parabolic move is sure to happen. But what we don't know is when to buy gold. We all know in financial crisis gold will fall too or when Powell goes for aggressive rate hike. But it wont capitulate like equities because gold moves slow. It's only in the parabolic moves that gold moves fast. But there are factors that causes it. So the narrative around it will surely come by 2025. Meaning. We buy some now and some portion in crisis. We will add silver too because it will move a lot if Gold goes parabolic.Kinda like how large cap help move small caps. Result : $6 Gold ( $3 right now + $3 in crisis ) + $4 Silver ( $2 right now + $2 in crisis ) Step 2 : 30% bonds. Now this thing is kinda hard to predict and is a matter of preference because there are many types of bonds available. What i will be doing is outperforming those other corporate bonds which gives high return but there are risk associated with it. This chart tell us low yield bonds are about to be bought as compared to high yield risk bonds So I picked TMF for this because i'm chasing high returns with no risk at all. Yes sure its a leveraged ETF but from this chart i know in coming few months most investors will be flocking to longer yield bonds because the growth scare hasn't yet been priced in. Hence the TMF bond will peak because of max euphoria at the end of Q4. My projection are already given in the charts. The only risk to it is change in terminal rates (3.2% aug 2023) or changing the definition of neutral.( 2-3%) TMF ( No income ) = 3 x TLT ( It gives fixed income quarterly ) Result : $15 right now in TMF + $15 ( wait for june TLT ) Step 3 : 60% Equities. Next 60% will be to equities. For this i will picking winner stock with 2025 max profits guarantees. It is up to you guys to decide which winner stock and how much should be in portfolio. And at what price levels are you comfortable with. a) Voldemort class ( These class of stocks are linked to the asset class i cannot name here because i will get banned. But hey we can name the stocks ) Includes : MTTR, MSTR, COIN, HOOD, HUT8, COIN, Winner : MTTR, COIN Reason : MSTR is bound to get liquidated since saylor is known for crisis like dotcom. HOOD c'mon guys we all hate it. Also Vlad is such a shit CEO. If he gets removed as CEO and Sam Bank man like Elon makes a play for position then heck yes. It could be proxy to investing with FTX. HUT8 hmm. I just don't like mining stocks. Matterport on the other hand has got metaverse play in it. So im expecting it to do a 8x by then and everybody loves Brian. Heck even the SEC too. He's got good leadership skills and would do anything for the company. $40 was such a good deal. Man i missed it. It was trading below its funding valuation and 2x the money they had. b) EV play. Includes : Rivian, Ford, GM, Tesla, Nio, Lucid Winner : Tesla, Nio Reason : I'm going calling the dibs on Tesla even though its price can fall to $380. Coz why won't you wanna have Tesla in your portfolio. Its still got India play left inside it. Yes supply chain are the problems but i believe this company will get help from china. Hence Nio too. So allocate some to Tesla and Nio. Nio because George Soros who broke bank of England is buying heavy. So Hf's or institutions would not even possibly think of shorting this stock. Such is the fear of Soros in Wallstreet. c) Gaming play + Chips Includes : AMD, Intel, Nvidia Winner : Nvidia ( Little partial ) Reason : I am partial to this even though AMD has started producing cheaper and better products and aren't suffering in supply chain as much. Nvidia in my opinion is world class and its products last longer than other products. Also there is a heavy demand by consumers. Nothing will ever change that. It's kinda like Apple of the space. Also its the leading in ml + ai too. I believe Tesla and Nvidia will partner in future. I could be wrong here and hey maybe AMD kicks its butt but i'm gonna go Nvidia. Also AMD has to fight some FUD articles in the future. Its up to you guys to decide. But i sure as hell don't want you to buy intel. d ) Payment play Includes : VISA, Master card, PayPal Winner : Paypal Reason :They are doing so much in Voldomort asset class. VISA wtf are you doing though by joking around with that sh9t. e ) The others Rest guys i believe in peace so no Palantir for me. And since Jamie Dimon is leaving i think JP Morgan will fall. If he stick around till 2025 then i sure as hell would keep this in my portfolio. Also i don't want Ecom in portfolio ( AMZN + Target + Walmart ) but i sure as hell want Google. Its got that growth in slowing economy factor for me. Because who forgets to search on google and play videos on Youtube. And then there is Cathie wood and her Roku. Look guys if she is doing an insider trading and knows something about the company that we don't then sure go all in on that stock only. Also remember the people who created SARKK have launched another ETF called ARKK leveraged 3x. So maybe if money flows around in it like SARKK then hey Roku gets most of the money since its her top holding. Winner : Google + Roku ( On your own level of risk ) f ) International Since China is about to stimulate its economy and Hong Kong basically is under china control then expect the popular stocks over there to grow as well. Includes : BABA, JD, Tencent Winner : BABA, Bytedance ( If it goes public ) Reason : Amazon and Target money will flow here. Also the low PE / PEG ratio is highly attractive. And hey Munger is buying alongside Blackrock and Bridgwater. Remember we chose Nio too. So keep them at 20% and divide yourselves. Note : The winner decision is solely according to me. Also i haven't given the price levels to buy. That is upto you guys to decide. This is not a Financial advise. As for the proof that i am buying here are my positions on some of the things that i went shopping around. Tesla + TMF The amount has not yet been credited yet. Result : It shall be knows until 2024-2025. Conclusion : Fuck i don't know if it will work. But hey if a monkey can beat the stock market so can this monkey too. P.s. I was quite heartbroken on Sunday so i was unable to write anything. Had to drink so much that this time that i couldn't write anything. Liverpool lost the EPL guys. We came so close. Had the Villa hold on for 20 more minutes what a script it would have been. Felt bad for that goalie though and Gerrard. Imagine slipping twice. Next week we kick Real ass in UCL. (Post Hang over post ) With lots of love guys. Thank you. Regards Uchiha",ofc man. I got hurt trading levv 20x - 50x. XD But the stock market hasn't got me. Not yet.,1,0.549,NEGATIVE,0.956
,"Respected Traders & Investors, I know folks, it's hard. Just hang on for a few more weeks. Okay!!! A fake exit liquidity rally like March FOMC is just around the corner. So please bear with me. I know times are tough, but guys, we have gotta dig deep and stick around. Until then let's have some fun creating a portfolio. A BS story from my dreams. Might as well skip it. ( Especially Tl;Dr folks ) Story about an island doom. Before we begin creating our portfolio, let me tell you all a story. It goes like there was an island in the middle of a huge ocean where everybody was having a blast. Rich people bought their yachts and the common folks brought their gondola boats. Everyday, the rich and common people used to boat around from the island shore to the middle of the ocean for food. The rich guys used their expensive equipment while the common folks used the traditional method of net for hunt. After everyone was done with their hunting, they used to head back to the island. As the night came down, the rich folks partied on their yachts, while the common folks used to party on the island itself and hence sleep in the stone cave passed by generations. As the days continued by, the people now had to go a little further from the day before because they weren't a lot of things left to hunt in the regions they used to before. As they were going far into the ocean, people started seeing many whales emerging from beneath the ocean. They looked kinda sick because they weren't moving a lot. No one knew the reason why they were slowly dying. Some folks saw this as a warning sign so they took off back to their island. But the rich folks didn't care, and so did some common folks. As the day passed by sharks started appearing in one's, two's and three's, and so on. With passing of each day there were more sharks than the previous one. They used to come for those whales and then leave. Slowly, all the whales disappeared, and hence the sharks too. Everyone thought it was all back to normal, so they continued with their hunting. But then came that fateful day when a swarm of sharks, which looked so hungry, started attacking the people in boats. Heck, there were some big hungry sharks that they even attacked the rick folks yacht. So both the common and rich folks tried to boat around back to the island for safety, but they had come so far off this time around. The yachts, though, were fast so they came back quickly, but the gondola boats were slow. Only the few lucky ones survived. It was all silence on the island. Everyone was quite afraid to head back to the far off water. Days past by and slowly we could see the water in the ocean started disappearing. Everybody was in amazement, like they saw some kind of magic, but some folks knew this was just the beginning of the bad days that were about to come. As months passed, the people started becoming angry because they now had to look for food in the jungle which wasn't quite tasteful compared to seafood. The rich folks used to come visit the island jungle, too, and take whatever they pleased.. At first people let it be because they thought the resources of the jungle were in plenty. But slowly, as time passed by they too became scarce. Now people from both sides were really getting angry. Riots started breaking out around b/w rich and common folks. The people started fighting against each other. The situation got so bad that rich folks started burning the places of ordinary folks. To which people replied back by throwing rocks at the yachts. As the years passed by, only the few survived to live the tale and were able to live off of the island's scare resources. As time progressed the water in the ocean started coming back and so were resources of the island that got depleted, replenished as more folks started going around for the hunt. And hence the cycle repeated itself again for 10 or more yrs. Moral of the story : I leave it to you people to decide in the comments section. Also, the last paragraph is kinda my interpretation of what happened. I leave that up to you. Hey, maybe no one survived to live the tale. Streak of losses Recap : 16th May - 20th May The last week was pretty crazy. S&P 500 finally entered its bear market and dropped to almost -22%. whereas the Nasdaq declined about -30% making this market performance as the worst since 1931 ""Great depression"". We also had 7 straight weeks of red which is just behind the March 2001 ""Dotcom crash"" and May 1970 ""Stagflation"". Apple warning : Later i said if Apple looks bad so will Tesla. Because both are cash Hedge. As my viewers already know we talked about Apple and Tesla warning in my last post where i was worried about their charts. So it indeed happened. Apple dropped below its 100 week MA and Tesla got hammered with FUD articles. Elon Musk thinks its a ploy by democrats.. What do y'all think. Tell me about in the comments section. By the way guys I see no one in Wall street bets talk about things before 1987. Why is that ? Everyone just wants to either compare things with recent recession of 2008 or they want the 1987 ""Black Monday"" crash where DOW dropped -20% in a day. I think people are really getting tired of this constant velocity crash with no acceleration to the downside. Some Economists thinks Powell should just rug-pull and kill the economy in a day. Why to wait for 6 months when things can be done in a day. Pretty shitty argument in my opinion cause why would you want to pressure economy in just a single day. Also some other Economists are calling for retail capitulation. I have no idea guys. It could come or not come before June or July FOMC. But it sure is heck is coming in Q4. ( It will be marked by capitulation in retail stocks, ) Hedge funds top Investments I was very lucky last week to have time and watch ""Jeremy Grantham"" and ""Ray Dalio"" my two favorite logical investors together for an online video conference where they talked about their views on economy. Both of them have a pretty different outlook for the future. Ray believes the changing world order is about to happen in this cycle where the China and rest other emerging markets from Asia such as India will boom as compared to USA where we could have a bust. (But his fund has an allocation to FTSE 100. Interesting) Jeremy believes we are in for a dotcom style crash. But both of them don't believe in the idea of recession this year but yeah the risk of stagflation are increasing day by day according to them. Growth in their opinion though will be slowing in the upcoming years. Also do watch ""All in podcast"" show. In latest episode we have a guy who predicted 5 out of the last 3 recessions and invested in We work.ðŸ˜‚ Okay moving on lets summarize key highlights of this week from CNBC television : Jet blue hostile bid for spirit airlines. Boeing is shit. Elon twitter drama. Oil to $150 after china deal. Warren Buffet buying energy and increasing stake in occidental petroleum. Healthcare and energy can be defensive and aggressive play for portfolio managers this year. Netflix upgraded by a bear. Walmart & Target earnings disaster. Retail sales 0.9% est 1% in April. Job cuts in Netflix and HOOD. Hiring freeze in Facebook & COIN. Fin-tech bottom is in according to analysts. Google is good in economic slowdown. Growth scare. Long term bond buying and equities falling regardless. The White House is now looking to cut corporate greed. Looks like no more price gouging. The unhedged hedge fund Melvin capital is shutting down. You guys did it. David won against Goliath. Identify the difference b/w short covering and bear market rally. Biden meets leaders of Sweden, Finland. Meaning they are going to join NATO this year. We have Monkey pox to deal with. Twitter says it's the courtesy of Bill Gates. Auto loan delinquencies hits highest since 2007. Sam Bank-man Fried bought Robinhood. FTX is about to start stock trading. Meaning if CBDC's by government arrives then petro dollar becomes hetero dollar of trading worldwide. Where we stand Now since many of you guys are new here. Let me bore you once again. We will eventually go into b/w of forgotten depression of 1921 and full blown depression. Depression is just a longer lasting recession. Recession in my opinion will happen later in Q4 because I don't think coming GDP print will be -ve but i think next one and the next one in January will be. Hence i always say when Dow jones hits anywhere b/w 50 MMA - 200 MMA just start DCAing in index ( picking stocks is hard ) like SPX, Nasdaq, DJI. Or if you really wanna buy stocks then go ahead pick the best stocks and DCA ( no one knows the true bottom ) that will last 10yrs. And have patience and conviction. Also we have short term swing trade in indices coming up. We could do this by DCAing index in before June or July FOMC and then sell in before September arrives. You could play options or specific stocks but i wont help you with which ones. I prefer index.

As the years passed by, only the few survived to live the tale and were able to live off of the island's scare resources. As time progressed the water in the ocean started coming back and so were resources of the island that got depleted, replenished as more folks started going around for the hunt. And hence the cycle repeated itself again for 10 or more yrs. Moral of the story : I leave it to you people to decide in the comments section. Also, the last paragraph is kinda my interpretation of what happened. I leave that up to you. Hey, maybe no one survived to live the tale. Streak of losses Recap : 16th May - 20th May The last week was pretty crazy. S&P 500 finally entered its bear market and dropped to almost -22%. whereas the Nasdaq declined about -30% making this market performance as the worst since 1931 ""Great depression"". We also had 7 straight weeks of red which is just behind the March 2001 ""Dotcom crash"" and May 1970 ""Stagflation"". Apple warning : Later i said if Apple looks bad so will Tesla. Because both are cash Hedge. As my viewers already know we talked about Apple and Tesla warning in my last post where i was worried about their charts. So it indeed happened. Apple dropped below its 100 week MA and Tesla got hammered with FUD articles. Elon Musk thinks its a ploy by democrats.. What do y'all think. Tell me about in the comments section. By the way guys I see no one in Wall street bets talk about things before 1987. Why is that ? Everyone just wants to either compare things with recent recession of 2008 or they want the 1987 ""Black Monday"" crash where DOW dropped -20% in a day. I think people are really getting tired of this constant velocity crash with no acceleration to the downside. Some Economists thinks Powell should just rug-pull and kill the economy in a day. Why to wait for 6 months when things can be done in a day. Pretty shitty argument in my opinion cause why would you want to pressure economy in just a single day. Also some other Economists are calling for retail capitulation. I have no idea guys. It could come or not come before June or July FOMC. But it sure is heck is coming in Q4. ( It will be marked by capitulation in retail stocks, ) Hedge funds top Investments I was very lucky last week to have time and watch ""Jeremy Grantham"" and ""Ray Dalio"" my two favorite logical investors together for an online video conference where they talked about their views on economy. Both of them have a pretty different outlook for the future. Ray believes the changing world order is about to happen in this cycle where the China and rest other emerging markets from Asia such as India will boom as compared to USA where we could have a bust. (But his fund has an allocation to FTSE 100. Interesting) Jeremy believes we are in for a dotcom style crash. But both of them don't believe in the idea of recession this year but yeah the risk of stagflation are increasing day by day according to them. Growth in their opinion though will be slowing in the upcoming years. Also do watch ""All in podcast"" show. In latest episode we have a guy who predicted 5 out of the last 3 recessions and invested in We work.ðŸ˜‚ Okay moving on lets summarize key highlights of this week from CNBC television : Jet blue hostile bid for spirit airlines. Boeing is shit. Elon twitter drama. Oil to $150 after china deal. Warren Buffet buying energy and increasing stake in occidental petroleum. Healthcare and energy can be defensive and aggressive play for portfolio managers this year. Netflix upgraded by a bear. Walmart & Target earnings disaster. Retail sales 0.9% est 1% in April. Job cuts in Netflix and HOOD. Hiring freeze in Facebook & COIN. Fin-tech bottom is in according to analysts. Google is good in economic slowdown. Growth scare. Long term bond buying and equities falling regardless. The White House is now looking to cut corporate greed. Looks like no more price gouging. The unhedged hedge fund Melvin capital is shutting down. You guys did it. David won against Goliath. Identify the difference b/w short covering and bear market rally. Biden meets leaders of Sweden, Finland. Meaning they are going to join NATO this year. We have Monkey pox to deal with. Twitter says it's the courtesy of Bill Gates. Auto loan delinquencies hits highest since 2007. Sam Bank-man Fried bought Robinhood. FTX is about to start stock trading. Meaning if CBDC's by government arrives then petro dollar becomes hetero dollar of trading worldwide. Where we stand Now since many of you guys are new here. Let me bore you once again. We will eventually go into b/w of forgotten depression of 1921 and full blown depression. Depression is just a longer lasting recession. Recession in my opinion will happen later in Q4 because I don't think coming GDP print will be -ve but i think next one and the next one in January will be. Hence i always say when Dow jones hits anywhere b/w 50 MMA - 200 MMA just start DCAing in index ( picking stocks is hard ) like SPX, Nasdaq, DJI. Or if you really wanna buy stocks then go ahead pick the best stocks and DCA ( no one knows the true bottom ) that will last 10yrs. And have patience and conviction. Also we have short term swing trade in indices coming up. We could do this by DCAing index in before June or July FOMC and then sell in before September arrives. You could play options or specific stocks but i wont help you with which ones. I prefer index. Charts of the week Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 1 : The 10yr breakevens on the chart are first thing that tops. It tells investors inflation problem is about to happen. Then it's the inflation that starts rising. Now depending upon the inflation level the bond yields rise. More the inflation more the Fed becomes hawkish. Hence at the end its the interest rate that tops. So in a sense 10yr breakevens are the leading indicator for inflation level. Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 2 : The 40 year cycle. We already know that the stock market revolves around a cycle. The 1940 - 1980 cycle in which the bond yields made higher high's and higher low's. And then the 1980 - 2020 cycle where bond yields made a lower high's and lower low's. During the first 40 cycle the interest rate peaked before the bond yields and were more higher in number. In the next 40 cycle the interest rate peaked after the bond yields and were much lower. The Boom Bust cycles XD Observation 3 : ( Don't laugh) So everyone knows how a economy works. I have taken a segment from a way longer cycle of economics passed from generations. ( The 90yr cycle ) We have a period of boom and then we have a period of bust. The boom period from 1980-2020 is over in my opinion where the talk was about globalization Chart : Dow Jones , Orange line : Bond yields , Blue line : Inflation Observation 4 : Let's find out where in history we could be. So high inflation with low bond yields right. So it could be the 1940's or 1948 when Fed decided to kill inflation by raising rates so high that it caused a deflationary period. Result : I have no idea where are we. This experiment was for nothing or maybe it was. But we pose similarity to all of the periods. Disease | Russia wise : 1921 Forgotten depression Chart wise and cycle wise : 1929 depression. Rate, Inflation and bond wise : 1940's. News event wise : 1970's stagflation. Technology and funding wise : 2000 dotcom bubble. WSB wise : 2008 recession. Welcome to the Jungle : Its time for our portfolio building Look guys before we begin let me tell you i am not an expert of fundamental analyzing the companies. But what i am good at is knowing the narratives beforehand and combining it with my technical analysis on stock market where it is headed. But yah of course i do watch earnings and this week is gonna be awesome. Let us begin this unique way of investing. This week : Earnings + FOMC minutes. Hypothesis : If stock valuation relative to others becomes cheap then the algorithms created by big institutions and Hedge funds will buy the stock and sell it quickly or hold according to their analysts or portfolio manger if they are interesting on betting the stock for next cycle. We are going to construct the most knowable portfolio passed down by the generations before. It's called a 60-40% portfolio. But we are gonna make few adjustments to it. Equities : 60% -> 40% USA + 20% international Bonds : 40% -> 30% bonds + 10% metals. We don't take commodities because they are for trading purposes mostly. Step 1 : 10% metals Gold Silver Since we are in 1921, 1929, 1940, 1970, 2000 or 2008. what we know is gold parabolic move is sure to happen. But what we don't know is when to buy gold. We all know in financial crisis gold will fall too or when Powell goes for aggressive rate hike. But it wont capitulate like equities because gold moves slow. It's only in the parabolic moves that gold moves fast. But there are factors that causes it. So the narrative around it will surely come by 2025. Meaning. We buy some now and some portion in crisis. We will add silver too because it will move a lot if Gold goes parabolic.Kinda like how large cap help move small caps. Result : $6 Gold ( $3 right now + $3 in crisis ) + $4 Silver ( $2 right now + $2 in crisis ) Step 2 : 30% bonds. Now this thing is kinda hard to predict and is a matter of preference because there are many types of bonds available. What i will be doing is outperforming those other corporate bonds which gives high return but there are risk associated with it. This chart tell us low yield bonds are about to be bought as compared to high yield risk bonds So I picked TMF for this because i'm chasing high returns with no risk at all. Yes sure its a leveraged ETF but from this chart i know in coming few months most investors will be flocking to longer yield bonds because the growth scare hasn't yet been priced in. Hence the TMF bond will peak because of max euphoria at the end of Q4. My projection are already given in the charts. The only risk to it is change in terminal rates (3.2% aug 2023) or changing the definition of neutral.( 2-3%) TMF ( No income ) = 3 x TLT ( It gives fixed income quarterly ) Result : $15 right now in TMF + $15 ( wait for june TLT ) Step 3 : 60% Equities. Next 60% will be to equities. For this i will picking winner stock with 2025 max profits guarantees. It is up to you guys to decide which winner stock and how much should be in portfolio. And at what price levels are you comfortable with. a) Voldemort class ( These class of stocks are linked to the asset class i cannot name here because i will get banned. But hey we can name the stocks ) Includes : MTTR, MSTR, COIN, HOOD, HUT8, COIN, Winner : MTTR, COIN Reason : MSTR is bound to get liquidated since saylor is known for crisis like dotcom. HOOD c'mon guys we all hate it. Also Vlad is such a shit CEO. If he gets removed as CEO and Sam Bank man like Elon makes a play for position then heck yes. It could be proxy to investing with FTX. HUT8 hmm. I just don't like mining stocks. Matterport on the other hand has got metaverse play in it. So im expecting it to do a 8x by then and everybody loves Brian. Heck even the SEC too. He's got good leadership skills and would do anything for the company. $40 was such a good deal. Man i missed it. It was trading below its funding valuation and 2x the money they had. b) EV play. Includes : Rivian, Ford, GM, Tesla, Nio, Lucid Winner : Tesla, Nio Reason : I'm going calling the dibs on Tesla even though its price can fall to $380. Coz why won't you wanna have Tesla in your portfolio. Its still got India play left inside it. Yes supply chain are the problems but i believe this company will get help from china. Hence Nio too. So allocate some to Tesla and Nio. Nio because George Soros who broke bank of England is buying heavy. So Hf's or institutions would not even possibly think of shorting this stock. Such is the fear of Soros in Wallstreet. c) Gaming play + Chips Includes : AMD, Intel, Nvidia Winner : Nvidia ( Little partial ) Reason : I am partial to this even though AMD has started producing cheaper and better products and aren't suffering in supply chain as much. Nvidia in my opinion is world class and its products last longer than other products. Also there is a heavy demand by consumers. Nothing will ever change that. It's kinda like Apple of the space. Also its the leading in ml + ai too. I believe Tesla and Nvidia will partner in future. I could be wrong here and hey maybe AMD kicks its butt but i'm gonna go Nvidia. Also AMD has to fight some FUD articles in the future. Its up to you guys to decide. But i sure as hell don't want you to buy intel. d ) Payment play Includes : VISA, Master card, PayPal Winner : Paypal Reason :They are doing so much in Voldomort asset class. VISA wtf are you doing though by joking around with that sh9t. e ) The others Rest guys i believe in peace so no Palantir for me. And since Jamie Dimon is leaving i think JP Morgan will fall. If he stick around till 2025 then i sure as hell would keep this in my portfolio. Also i don't want Ecom in portfolio ( AMZN + Target + Walmart ) but i sure as hell want Google. Its got that growth in slowing economy factor for me. Because who forgets to search on google and play videos on Youtube. And then there is Cathie wood and her Roku. Look guys if she is doing an insider trading and knows something about the company that we don't then sure go all in on that stock only. Also remember the people who created SARKK have launched another ETF called ARKK leveraged 3x. So maybe if money flows around in it like SARKK then hey Roku gets most of the money since its her top holding. Winner : Google + Roku ( On your own level of risk ) f ) International Since China is about to stimulate its economy and Hong Kong basically is under china control then expect the popular stocks over there to grow as well. Includes : BABA, JD, Tencent Winner : BABA, Bytedance ( If it goes public ) Reason : Amazon and Target money will flow here. Also the low PE / PEG ratio is highly attractive. And hey Munger is buying alongside Blackrock and Bridgwater. Remember we chose Nio too. So keep them at 20% and divide yourselves. Note : The winner decision is solely according to me. Also i haven't given the price levels to buy. That is upto you guys to decide. This is not a Financial advise. As for the proof that i am buying here are my positions on some of the things that i went shopping around. Tesla + TMF The amount has not yet been credited yet. Result : It shall be knows until 2024-2025. Conclusion : Fuck i don't know if it will work. But hey if a monkey can beat the stock market so can this monkey too. P.s. I was quite heartbroken on Sunday so i was unable to write anything. Had to drink so much that this time that i couldn't write anything. Liverpool lost the EPL guys. We came so close. Had the Villa hold on for 20 more minutes what a script it would have been. Felt bad for that goalie though and Gerrard. Imagine slipping twice. Next week we kick Real ass in UCL.

,"Respected Traders & Investors, I know folks, it's hard. Just hang on for a few more weeks. Okay!!! A fake exit liquidity rally like March FOMC is just around the corner. So please bear with me. I know times are tough, but guys, we have gotta dig deep and stick around. Until then let's have some fun creating a portfolio. A BS story from my dreams. Might as well skip it. ( Especially Tl;Dr folks ) Story about an island doom. Before we begin creating our portfolio, let me tell you all a story. It goes like there was an island in the middle of a huge ocean where everybody was having a blast. Rich people bought their yachts and the common folks brought their gondola boats. Everyday, the rich and common people used to boat around from the island shore to the middle of the ocean for food. The rich guys used their expensive equipment while the common folks used the traditional method of net for hunt. After everyone was done with their hunting, they used to head back to the island. As the night came down, the rich folks partied on their yachts, while the common folks used to party on the island itself and hence sleep in the stone cave passed by generations. As the days continued by, the people now had to go a little further from the day before because they weren't a lot of things left to hunt in the regions they used to before. As they were going far into the ocean, people started seeing many whales emerging from beneath the ocean. They looked kinda sick because they weren't moving a lot. No one knew the reason why they were slowly dying. Some folks saw this as a warning sign so they took off back to their island. But the rich folks didn't care, and so did some common folks. As the day passed by sharks started appearing in one's, two's and three's, and so on. With passing of each day there were more sharks than the previous one. They used to come for those whales and then leave. Slowly, all the whales disappeared, and hence the sharks too. Everyone thought it was all back to normal, so they continued with their hunting. But then came that fateful day when a swarm of sharks, which looked so hungry, started attacking the people in boats. Heck, there were some big hungry sharks that they even attacked the rick folks yacht. So both the common and rich folks tried to boat around back to the island for safety, but they had come so far off this time around. The yachts, though, were fast so they came back quickly, but the gondola boats were slow. Only the few lucky ones survived. It was all silence on the island. Everyone was quite afraid to head back to the far off water. Days past by and slowly we could see the water in the ocean started disappearing. Everybody was in amazement, like they saw some kind of magic, but some folks knew this was just the beginning of the bad days that were about to come. As months passed, the people started becoming angry because they now had to look for food in the jungle which wasn't quite tasteful compared to seafood. The rich folks used to come visit the island jungle, too, and take whatever they pleased.. At first people let it be because they thought the resources of the jungle were in plenty. But slowly, as time passed by they too became scarce. Now people from both sides were really getting angry. Riots started breaking out around b/w rich and common folks. The people started fighting against each other. The situation got so bad that rich folks started burning the places of ordinary folks. To which people replied back by throwing rocks at the yachts. As the years passed by, only the few survived to live the tale and were able to live off of the island's scare resources. As time progressed the water in the ocean started coming back and so were resources of the island that got depleted, replenished as more folks started going around for the hunt. And hence the cycle repeated itself again for 10 or more yrs. Moral of the story : I leave it to you people to decide in the comments section.

Winner : Google + Roku ( On your own level of risk ) f ) International Since China is about to stimulate its economy and Hong Kong basically is under china control then expect the popular stocks over there to grow as well. Includes : BABA, JD, Tencent Winner : BABA, Bytedance ( If it goes public ) Reason : Amazon and Target money will flow here. Also the low PE / PEG ratio is highly attractive. And hey Munger is buying alongside Blackrock and Bridgwater. Remember we chose Nio too. So keep them at 20% and divide yourselves. Note : The winner decision is solely according to me. Also i haven't given the price levels to buy. That is upto you guys to decide. This is not a Financial advise. As for the proof that i am buying here are my positions on some of the things that i went shopping around. Tesla + TMF The amount has not yet been credited yet. Result : It shall be knows until 2024-2025. Conclusion : Fuck i don't know if it will work. But hey if a monkey can beat the stock market so can this monkey too. P.s. I was quite heartbroken on Sunday so i was unable to write anything. Had to drink so much that this time that i couldn't write anything. Liverpool lost the EPL guys. We came so close. Had the Villa hold on for 20 more minutes what a script it would have been. Felt bad for that goalie though and Gerrard. Imagine slipping twice. Next week we kick Real ass in UCL.

,"Respected Traders & Investors, I know folks, it's hard. Just hang on for a few more weeks. Okay!!! A fake exit liquidity rally like March FOMC is just around the corner. So please bear with me. I know times are tough, but guys, we have gotta dig deep and stick around. Until then let's have some fun creating a portfolio. A BS story from my dreams. Might as well skip it. ( Especially Tl;Dr folks ) Story about an island doom. Before we begin creating our portfolio, let me tell you all a story. It goes like there was an island in the middle of a huge ocean where everybody was having a blast. Rich people bought their yachts and the common folks brought their gondola boats. Everyday, the rich and common people used to boat around from the island shore to the middle of the ocean for food. The rich guys used their expensive equipment while the common folks used the traditional method of net for hunt. After everyone was done with their hunting, they used to head back to the island. As the night came down, the rich folks partied on their yachts, while the common folks used to party on the island itself and hence sleep in the stone cave passed by generations. As the days continued by, the people now had to go a little further from the day before because they weren't a lot of things left to hunt in the regions they used to before. As they were going far into the ocean, people started seeing many whales emerging from beneath the ocean. They looked kinda sick because they weren't moving a lot. No one knew the reason why they were slowly dying. Some folks saw this as a warning sign so they took off back to their island. But the rich folks didn't care, and so did some common folks. As the day passed by sharks started appearing in one's, two's and three's, and so on. With passing of each day there were more sharks than the previous one. They used to come for those whales and then leave. Slowly, all the whales disappeared, and hence the sharks too. Everyone thought it was all back to normal, so they continued with their hunting. But then came that fateful day when a swarm of sharks, which looked so hungry, started attacking the people in boats. Heck, there were some big hungry sharks that they even attacked the rick folks yacht. So both the common and rich folks tried to boat around back to the island for safety, but they had come so far off this time around. The yachts, though, were fast so they came back quickly, but the gondola boats were slow. Only the few lucky ones survived. It was all silence on the island. Everyone was quite afraid to head back to the far off water. Days past by and slowly we could see the water in the ocean started disappearing. Everybody was in amazement, like they saw some kind of magic, but some folks knew this was just the beginning of the bad days that were about to come. As months passed, the people started becoming angry because they now had to look for food in the jungle which wasn't quite tasteful compared to seafood. The rich folks used to come visit the island jungle, too, and take whatever they pleased.. At first people let it be because they thought the resources of the jungle were in plenty. But slowly, as time passed by they too became scarce. Now people from both sides were really getting angry. Riots started breaking out around b/w rich and common folks. The people started fighting against each other. The situation got so bad that rich folks started burning the places of ordinary folks. To which people replied back by throwing rocks at the yachts. As the years passed by, only the few survived to live the tale and were able to live off of the island's scare resources. As time progressed the water in the ocean started coming back and so were resources of the island that got depleted, replenished as more folks started going around for the hunt. And hence the cycle repeated itself again for 10 or more yrs. Moral of the story : I leave it to you people to decide in the comments section. Also, the last paragraph is kinda my interpretation of what happened. I leave that up to you. Hey, maybe no one survived to live the tale. Streak of losses Recap : 16th May - 20th May The last week was pretty crazy. S&P 500 finally entered its bear market and dropped to almost -22%. whereas the Nasdaq declined about -30% making this market performance as the worst since 1931 ""Great depression"". We also had 7 straight weeks of red which is just behind the March 2001 ""Dotcom crash"" and May 1970 ""Stagflation"". Apple warning : Later i said if Apple looks bad so will Tesla. Because both are cash Hedge. As my viewers already know we talked about Apple and Tesla warning in my last post where i was worried about their charts. So it indeed happened. Apple dropped below its 100 week MA and Tesla got hammered with FUD articles. Elon Musk thinks its a ploy by democrats.. What do y'all think. Tell me about in the comments section. By the way guys I see no one in Wall street bets talk about things before 1987. Why is that ? Everyone just wants to either compare things with recent recession of 2008 or they want the 1987 ""Black Monday"" crash where DOW dropped -20% in a day. I think people are really getting tired of this constant velocity crash with no acceleration to the downside. Some Economists thinks Powell should just rug-pull and kill the economy in a day. Why to wait for 6 months when things can be done in a day. Pretty shitty argument in my opinion cause why would you want to pressure economy in just a single day. Also some other Economists are calling for retail capitulation. I have no idea guys. It could come or not come before June or July FOMC. But it sure is heck is coming in Q4. ( It will be marked by capitulation in retail stocks, ) Hedge funds top Investments I was very lucky last week to have time and watch ""Jeremy Grantham"" and ""Ray Dalio"" my two favorite logical investors together for an online video conference where they talked about their views on economy. Both of them have a pretty different outlook for the future. Ray believes the changing world order is about to happen in this cycle where the China and rest other emerging markets from Asia such as India will boom as compared to USA where we could have a bust. (But his fund has an allocation to FTSE 100. Interesting) Jeremy believes we are in for a dotcom style crash. But both of them don't believe in the idea of recession this year but yeah the risk of stagflation are increasing day by day according to them. Growth in their opinion though will be slowing in the upcoming years. Also do watch ""All in podcast"" show. In latest episode we have a guy who predicted 5 out of the last 3 recessions and invested in We work.ðŸ˜‚ Okay moving on lets summarize key highlights of this week from CNBC television : Jet blue hostile bid for spirit airlines. Boeing is shit. Elon twitter drama. Oil to $150 after china deal. Warren Buffet buying energy and increasing stake in occidental petroleum. Healthcare and energy can be defensive and aggressive play for portfolio managers this year. Netflix upgraded by a bear. Walmart & Target earnings disaster. Retail sales 0.9% est 1% in April. Job cuts in Netflix and HOOD. Hiring freeze in Facebook & COIN. Fin-tech bottom is in according to analysts. Google is good in economic slowdown. Growth scare. Long term bond buying and equities falling regardless. The White House is now looking to cut corporate greed. Looks like no more price gouging. The unhedged hedge fund Melvin capital is shutting down. You guys did it. David won against Goliath. Identify the difference b/w short covering and bear market rally. Biden meets leaders of Sweden, Finland. Meaning they are going to join NATO this year. We have Monkey pox to deal with. Twitter says it's the courtesy of Bill Gates. Auto loan delinquencies hits highest since 2007. Sam Bank-man Fried bought Robinhood. FTX is about to start stock trading. Meaning if CBDC's by government arrives then petro dollar becomes hetero dollar of trading worldwide. Where we stand Now since many of you guys are new here. Let me bore you once again. We will eventually go into b/w of forgotten depression of 1921 and full blown depression. Depression is just a longer lasting recession. Recession in my opinion will happen later in Q4 because I don't think coming GDP print will be -ve but i think next one and the next one in January will be. Hence i always say when Dow jones hits anywhere b/w 50 MMA - 200 MMA just start DCAing in index ( picking stocks is hard ) like SPX, Nasdaq, DJI. Or if you really wanna buy stocks then go ahead pick the best stocks and DCA ( no one knows the true bottom ) that will last 10yrs. And have patience and conviction. Also we have short term swing trade in indices coming up. We could do this by DCAing index in before June or July FOMC and then sell in before September arrives. You could play options or specific stocks but i wont help you with which ones. I prefer index. Charts of the week Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 1 : The 10yr breakevens on the chart are first thing that tops. It tells investors inflation problem is about to happen. Then it's the inflation that starts rising. Now depending upon the inflation level the bond yields rise. More the inflation more the Fed becomes hawkish. Hence at the end its the interest rate that tops. So in a sense 10yr breakevens are the leading indicator for inflation level. Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 2 : The 40 year cycle. We already know that the stock market revolves around a cycle. The 1940 - 1980 cycle in which the bond yields made higher high's and higher low's. And then the 1980 - 2020 cycle where bond yields made a lower high's and lower low's. During the first 40 cycle the interest rate peaked before the bond yields and were more higher in number. In the next 40 cycle the interest rate peaked after the bond yields and were much lower. The Boom Bust cycles XD Observation 3 : ( Don't laugh) So everyone knows how a economy works. I have taken a segment from a way longer cycle of economics passed from generations. ( The 90yr cycle ) We have a period of boom and then we have a period of bust. The boom period from 1980-2020 is over in my opinion where the talk was about globalization Chart : Dow Jones , Orange line : Bond yields , Blue line : Inflation Observation 4 : Let's find out where in history we could be. So high inflation with low bond yields right. So it could be the 1940's or 1948 when Fed decided to kill inflation by raising rates so high that it caused a deflationary period. Result : I have no idea where are we. This experiment was for nothing or maybe it was. But we pose similarity to all of the periods. Disease | Russia wise : 1921 Forgotten depression Chart wise and cycle wise : 1929 depression. Rate, Inflation and bond wise : 1940's. News event wise : 1970's stagflation. Technology and funding wise : 2000 dotcom bubble. WSB wise : 2008 recession. Welcome to the Jungle : Its time for our portfolio building Look guys before we begin let me tell you i am not an expert of fundamental analyzing the companies. But what i am good at is knowing the narratives beforehand and combining it with my technical analysis on stock market where it is headed. But yah of course i do watch earnings and this week is gonna be awesome. Let us begin this unique way of investing. This week : Earnings + FOMC minutes. Hypothesis : If stock valuation relative to others becomes cheap then the algorithms created by big institutions and Hedge funds will buy the stock and sell it quickly or hold according to their analysts or portfolio manger if they are interesting on betting the stock for next cycle. We are going to construct the most knowable portfolio passed down by the generations before. It's called a 60-40% portfolio. But we are gonna make few adjustments to it. Equities : 60% -> 40% USA + 20% international Bonds : 40% -> 30% bonds + 10% metals. We don't take commodities because they are for trading purposes mostly. Step 1 : 10% metals Gold Silver Since we are in 1921, 1929, 1940, 1970, 2000 or 2008. what we know is gold parabolic move is sure to happen. But what we don't know is when to buy gold. We all know in financial crisis gold will fall too or when Powell goes for aggressive rate hike. But it wont capitulate like equities because gold moves slow. It's only in the parabolic moves that gold moves fast. But there are factors that causes it. So the narrative around it will surely come by 2025. Meaning. We buy some now and some portion in crisis. We will add silver too because it will move a lot if Gold goes parabolic.Kinda like how large cap help move small caps. Result : $6 Gold ( $3 right now + $3 in crisis ) + $4 Silver ( $2 right now + $2 in crisis ) Step 2 : 30% bonds. Now this thing is kinda hard to predict and is a matter of preference because there are many types of bonds available. What i will be doing is outperforming those other corporate bonds which gives high return but there are risk associated with it. This chart tell us low yield bonds are about to be bought as compared to high yield risk bonds So I picked TMF for this because i'm chasing high returns with no risk at all. Yes sure its a leveraged ETF but from this chart i know in coming few months most investors will be flocking to longer yield bonds because the growth scare hasn't yet been priced in. Hence the TMF bond will peak because of max euphoria at the end of Q4. My projection are already given in the charts. The only risk to it is change in terminal rates (3.2% aug 2023) or changing the definition of neutral.( 2-3%) TMF ( No income ) = 3 x TLT ( It gives fixed income quarterly ) Result : $15 right now in TMF + $15 ( wait for june TLT ) Step 3 : 60% Equities. Next 60% will be to equities. For this i will picking winner stock with 2025 max profits guarantees. It is up to you guys to decide which winner stock and how much should be in portfolio. And at what price levels are you comfortable with. a) Voldemort class ( These class of stocks are linked to the asset class i cannot name here because i will get banned. But hey we can name the stocks ) Includes : MTTR, MSTR, COIN, HOOD, HUT8, COIN, Winner : MTTR, COIN Reason : MSTR is bound to get liquidated since saylor is known for crisis like dotcom. HOOD c'mon guys we all hate it. Also Vlad is such a shit CEO. If he gets removed as CEO and Sam Bank man like Elon makes a play for position then heck yes. It could be proxy to investing with FTX. HUT8 hmm. I just don't like mining stocks. Matterport on the other hand has got metaverse play in it. So im expecting it to do a 8x by then and everybody loves Brian. Heck even the SEC too. He's got good leadership skills and would do anything for the company. $40 was such a good deal. Man i missed it. It was trading below its funding valuation and 2x the money they had. b) EV play. Includes : Rivian, Ford, GM, Tesla, Nio, Lucid Winner : Tesla, Nio Reason : I'm going calling the dibs on Tesla even though its price can fall to $380. Coz why won't you wanna have Tesla in your portfolio. Its still got India play left inside it. Yes supply chain are the problems but i believe this company will get help from china. Hence Nio too. So allocate some to Tesla and Nio. Nio because George Soros who broke bank of England is buying heavy. So Hf's or institutions would not even possibly think of shorting this stock. Such is the fear of Soros in Wallstreet. c) Gaming play + Chips Includes : AMD, Intel, Nvidia Winner : Nvidia ( Little partial ) Reason : I am partial to this even though AMD has started producing cheaper and better products and aren't suffering in supply chain as much. Nvidia in my opinion is world class and its products last longer than other products. Also there is a heavy demand by consumers. Nothing will ever change that. It's kinda like Apple of the space. Also its the leading in ml + ai too. I believe Tesla and Nvidia will partner in future. I could be wrong here and hey maybe AMD kicks its butt but i'm gonna go Nvidia. Also AMD has to fight some FUD articles in the future. Its up to you guys to decide. But i sure as hell don't want you to buy intel. d ) Payment play Includes : VISA, Master card, PayPal Winner : Paypal Reason :They are doing so much in Voldomort asset class. VISA wtf are you doing though by joking around with that sh9t. e ) The others Rest guys i believe in peace so no Palantir for me. And since Jamie Dimon is leaving i think JP Morgan will fall. If he stick around till 2025 then i sure as hell would keep this in my portfolio. Also i don't want Ecom in portfolio ( AMZN + Target + Walmart ) but i sure as hell want Google. Its got that growth in slowing economy factor for me. Because who forgets to search on google and play videos on Youtube. And then there is Cathie wood and her Roku. Look guys if she is doing an insider trading and knows something about the company that we don't then sure go all in on that stock only. Also remember the people who created SARKK have launched another ETF called ARKK leveraged 3x. So maybe if money flows around in it like SARKK then hey Roku gets most of the money since its her top holding. Winner : Google + Roku ( On your own level of risk ) f ) International Since China is about to stimulate its economy and Hong Kong basically is under china control then expect the popular stocks over there to grow as well. Includes : BABA, JD, Tencent Winner : BABA, Bytedance ( If it goes public ) Reason : Amazon and Target money will flow here. Also the low PE / PEG ratio is highly attractive. And hey Munger is buying alongside Blackrock and Bridgwater. Remember we chose Nio too. So keep them at 20% and divide yourselves. Note : The winner decision is solely according to me. Also i haven't given the price levels to buy. That is upto you guys to decide. This is not a Financial advise. As for the proof that i am buying here are my positions on some of the things that i went shopping around. Tesla + TMF The amount has not yet been credited yet. Result : It shall be knows until 2024-2025. Conclusion : Fuck i don't know if it will work. But hey if a monkey can beat the stock market so can this monkey too. P.s. I was quite heartbroken on Sunday so i was unable to write anything. Had to drink so much that this time that i couldn't write anything. Liverpool lost the EPL guys. We came so close. Had the Villa hold on for 20 more minutes what a script it would have been. Felt bad for that goalie though and Gerrard. Imagine slipping twice. Next week we kick Real ass in UCL. (Post Hang over post ) With lots of love guys. Thank you. Regards Uchiha",Yes sir. I was bored.

It's only in the parabolic moves that gold moves fast. But there are factors that causes it. So the narrative around it will surely come by 2025. Meaning. We buy some now and some portion in crisis. We will add silver too because it will move a lot if Gold goes parabolic.Kinda like how large cap help move small caps. Result : $6 Gold ( $3 right now + $3 in crisis ) + $4 Silver ( $2 right now + $2 in crisis ) Step 2 : 30% bonds. Now this thing is kinda hard to predict and is a matter of preference because there are many types of bonds available. What i will be doing is outperforming those other corporate bonds which gives high return but there are risk associated with it. This chart tell us low yield bonds are about to be bought as compared to high yield risk bonds So I picked TMF for this because i'm chasing high returns with no risk at all. Yes sure its a leveraged ETF but from this chart i know in coming few months most investors will be flocking to longer yield bonds because the growth scare hasn't yet been priced in. Hence the TMF bond will peak because of max euphoria at the end of Q4. My projection are already given in the charts. The only risk to it is change in terminal rates (3.2% aug 2023) or changing the definition of neutral.( 2-3%) TMF ( No income ) = 3 x TLT ( It gives fixed income quarterly ) Result : $15 right now in TMF + $15 ( wait for june TLT ) Step 3 : 60% Equities. Next 60% will be to equities. For this i will picking winner stock with 2025 max profits guarantees. It is up to you guys to decide which winner stock and how much should be in portfolio. And at what price levels are you comfortable with. a) Voldemort class ( These class of stocks are linked to the asset class i cannot name here because i will get banned. But hey we can name the stocks ) Includes : MTTR, MSTR, COIN, HOOD, HUT8, COIN, Winner : MTTR, COIN Reason : MSTR is bound to get liquidated since saylor is known for crisis like dotcom. HOOD c'mon guys we all hate it. Also Vlad is such a shit CEO. If he gets removed as CEO and Sam Bank man like Elon makes a play for position then heck yes. It could be proxy to investing with FTX. HUT8 hmm. I just don't like mining stocks. Matterport on the other hand has got metaverse play in it. So im expecting it to do a 8x by then and everybody loves Brian. Heck even the SEC too. He's got good leadership skills and would do anything for the company. $40 was such a good deal. Man i missed it. It was trading below its funding valuation and 2x the money they had. b) EV play. Includes : Rivian, Ford, GM, Tesla, Nio, Lucid Winner : Tesla, Nio Reason : I'm going calling the dibs on Tesla even though its price can fall to $380. Coz why won't you wanna have Tesla in your portfolio. Its still got India play left inside it. Yes supply chain are the problems but i believe this company will get help from china. Hence Nio too. So allocate some to Tesla and Nio. Nio because George Soros who broke bank of England is buying heavy. So Hf's or institutions would not even possibly think of shorting this stock. Such is the fear of Soros in Wallstreet. c) Gaming play + Chips Includes : AMD, Intel, Nvidia Winner : Nvidia ( Little partial ) Reason : I am partial to this even though AMD has started producing cheaper and better products and aren't suffering in supply chain as much. Nvidia in my opinion is world class and its products last longer than other products. Also there is a heavy demand by consumers. Nothing will ever change that. It's kinda like Apple of the space. Also its the leading in ml + ai too. I believe Tesla and Nvidia will partner in future. I could be wrong here and hey maybe AMD kicks its butt but i'm gonna go Nvidia. Also AMD has to fight some FUD articles in the future. Its up to you guys to decide. But i sure as hell don't want you to buy intel. d ) Payment play Includes : VISA, Master card, PayPal Winner : Paypal Reason :They are doing so much in Voldomort asset class. VISA wtf are you doing though by joking around with that sh9t. e ) The others Rest guys i believe in peace so no Palantir for me. And since Jamie Dimon is leaving i think JP Morgan will fall. If he stick around till 2025 then i sure as hell would keep this in my portfolio. Also i don't want Ecom in portfolio ( AMZN + Target + Walmart ) but i sure as hell want Google. Its got that growth in slowing economy factor for me. Because who forgets to search on google and play videos on Youtube. And then there is Cathie wood and her Roku. Look guys if she is doing an insider trading and knows something about the company that we don't then sure go all in on that stock only. Also remember the people who created SARKK have launched another ETF called ARKK leveraged 3x. So maybe if money flows around in it like SARKK then hey Roku gets most of the money since its her top holding. Winner : Google + Roku ( On your own level of risk ) f ) International Since China is about to stimulate its economy and Hong Kong basically is under china control then expect the popular stocks over there to grow as well. Includes : BABA, JD, Tencent Winner : BABA, Bytedance ( If it goes public ) Reason : Amazon and Target money will flow here. Also the low PE / PEG ratio is highly attractive. And hey Munger is buying alongside Blackrock and Bridgwater. Remember we chose Nio too. So keep them at 20% and divide yourselves. Note : The winner decision is solely according to me. Also i haven't given the price levels to buy. That is upto you guys to decide. This is not a Financial advise. As for the proof that i am buying here are my positions on some of the things that i went shopping around. Tesla + TMF The amount has not yet been credited yet. Result : It shall be knows until 2024-2025. Conclusion : Fuck i don't know if it will work. But hey if a monkey can beat the stock market so can this monkey too. P.s. I was quite heartbroken on Sunday so i was unable to write anything. Had to drink so much that this time that i couldn't write anything. Liverpool lost the EPL guys. We came so close. Had the Villa hold on for 20 more minutes what a script it would have been. Felt bad for that goalie though and Gerrard. Imagine slipping twice. Next week we kick Real ass in UCL. (Post Hang over post ) With lots of love guys. Thank you. Regards Uchiha",Yes sir. I was bored. There is just nothing to do beside sit on cash and wait for a day before june or july fomc for bottom and then swing trade. And then there is again pain starting from sept/oct to jan / feb.,1,0.511,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Respected Traders & Investors, I know folks, it's hard. Just hang on for a few more weeks. Okay!!! A fake exit liquidity rally like March FOMC is just around the corner. So please bear with me. I know times are tough, but guys, we have gotta dig deep and stick around. Until then let's have some fun creating a portfolio. A BS story from my dreams. Might as well skip it. ( Especially Tl;Dr folks ) Story about an island doom. Before we begin creating our portfolio, let me tell you all a story. It goes like there was an island in the middle of a huge ocean where everybody was having a blast. Rich people bought their yachts and the common folks brought their gondola boats. Everyday, the rich and common people used to boat around from the island shore to the middle of the ocean for food. The rich guys used their expensive equipment while the common folks used the traditional method of net for hunt. After everyone was done with their hunting, they used to head back to the island. As the night came down, the rich folks partied on their yachts, while the common folks used to party on the island itself and hence sleep in the stone cave passed by generations. As the days continued by, the people now had to go a little further from the day before because they weren't a lot of things left to hunt in the regions they used to before. As they were going far into the ocean, people started seeing many whales emerging from beneath the ocean. They looked kinda sick because they weren't moving a lot. No one knew the reason why they were slowly dying. Some folks saw this as a warning sign so they took off back to their island. But the rich folks didn't care, and so did some common folks. As the day passed by sharks started appearing in one's, two's and three's, and so on. With passing of each day there were more sharks than the previous one. They used to come for those whales and then leave. Slowly, all the whales disappeared, and hence the sharks too. Everyone thought it was all back to normal, so they continued with their hunting. But then came that fateful day when a swarm of sharks, which looked so hungry, started attacking the people in boats. Heck, there were some big hungry sharks that they even attacked the rick folks yacht. So both the common and rich folks tried to boat around back to the island for safety, but they had come so far off this time around. The yachts, though, were fast so they came back quickly, but the gondola boats were slow. Only the few lucky ones survived. It was all silence on the island. Everyone was quite afraid to head back to the far off water. Days past by and slowly we could see the water in the ocean started disappearing. Everybody was in amazement, like they saw some kind of magic, but some folks knew this was just the beginning of the bad days that were about to come. As months passed, the people started becoming angry because they now had to look for food in the jungle which wasn't quite tasteful compared to seafood. The rich folks used to come visit the island jungle, too, and take whatever they pleased.. At first people let it be because they thought the resources of the jungle were in plenty. But slowly, as time passed by they too became scarce. Now people from both sides were really getting angry. Riots started breaking out around b/w rich and common folks. The people started fighting against each other. The situation got so bad that rich folks started burning the places of ordinary folks. To which people replied back by throwing rocks at the yachts. As the years passed by, only the few survived to live the tale and were able to live off of the island's scare resources. As time progressed the water in the ocean started coming back and so were resources of the island that got depleted, replenished as more folks started going around for the hunt. And hence the cycle repeated itself again for 10 or more yrs. Moral of the story : I leave it to you people to decide in the comments section. Also, the last paragraph is kinda my interpretation of what happened. I leave that up to you. Hey, maybe no one survived to live the tale. Streak of losses Recap : 16th May - 20th May The last week was pretty crazy. S&P 500 finally entered its bear market and dropped to almost -22%. whereas the Nasdaq declined about -30% making this market performance as the worst since 1931 ""Great depression"". We also had 7 straight weeks of red which is just behind the March 2001 ""Dotcom crash"" and May 1970 ""Stagflation"". Apple warning : Later i said if Apple looks bad so will Tesla. Because both are cash Hedge. As my viewers already know we talked about Apple and Tesla warning in my last post where i was worried about their charts. So it indeed happened. Apple dropped below its 100 week MA and Tesla got hammered with FUD articles. Elon Musk thinks its a ploy by democrats.. What do y'all think. Tell me about in the comments section. By the way guys I see no one in Wall street bets talk about things before 1987. Why is that ? Everyone just wants to either compare things with recent recession of 2008 or they want the 1987 ""Black Monday"" crash where DOW dropped -20% in a day. I think people are really getting tired of this constant velocity crash with no acceleration to the downside. Some Economists thinks Powell should just rug-pull and kill the economy in a day. Why to wait for 6 months when things can be done in a day. Pretty shitty argument in my opinion cause why would you want to pressure economy in just a single day. Also some other Economists are calling for retail capitulation. I have no idea guys. It could come or not come before June or July FOMC. But it sure is heck is coming in Q4. ( It will be marked by capitulation in retail stocks, ) Hedge funds top Investments I was very lucky last week to have time and watch ""Jeremy Grantham"" and ""Ray Dalio"" my two favorite logical investors together for an online video conference where they talked about their views on economy. Both of them have a pretty different outlook for the future. Ray believes the changing world order is about to happen in this cycle where the China and rest other emerging markets from Asia such as India will boom as compared to USA where we could have a bust. (But his fund has an allocation to FTSE 100. Interesting) Jeremy believes we are in for a dotcom style crash. But both of them don't believe in the idea of recession this year but yeah the risk of stagflation are increasing day by day according to them. Growth in their opinion though will be slowing in the upcoming years. Also do watch ""All in podcast"" show. In latest episode we have a guy who predicted 5 out of the last 3 recessions and invested in We work.ðŸ˜‚ Okay moving on lets summarize key highlights of this week from CNBC television : Jet blue hostile bid for spirit airlines. Boeing is shit. Elon twitter drama. Oil to $150 after china deal. Warren Buffet buying energy and increasing stake in occidental petroleum. Healthcare and energy can be defensive and aggressive play for portfolio managers this year. Netflix upgraded by a bear. Walmart & Target earnings disaster. Retail sales 0.9% est 1% in April. Job cuts in Netflix and HOOD. Hiring freeze in Facebook & COIN. Fin-tech bottom is in according to analysts. Google is good in economic slowdown. Growth scare. Long term bond buying and equities falling regardless. The White House is now looking to cut corporate greed. Looks like no more price gouging. The unhedged hedge fund Melvin capital is shutting down. You guys did it. David won against Goliath. Identify the difference b/w short covering and bear market rally. Biden meets leaders of Sweden, Finland. Meaning they are going to join NATO this year. We have Monkey pox to deal with. Twitter says it's the courtesy of Bill Gates. Auto loan delinquencies hits highest since 2007. Sam Bank-man Fried bought Robinhood. FTX is about to start stock trading. Meaning if CBDC's by government arrives then petro dollar becomes hetero dollar of trading worldwide. Where we stand Now since many of you guys are new here. Let me bore you once again. We will eventually go into b/w of forgotten depression of 1921 and full blown depression. Depression is just a longer lasting recession. Recession in my opinion will happen later in Q4 because I don't think coming GDP print will be -ve but i think next one and the next one in January will be. Hence i always say when Dow jones hits anywhere b/w 50 MMA - 200 MMA just start DCAing in index ( picking stocks is hard ) like SPX, Nasdaq, DJI. Or if you really wanna buy stocks then go ahead pick the best stocks and DCA ( no one knows the true bottom ) that will last 10yrs. And have patience and conviction. Also we have short term swing trade in indices coming up. We could do this by DCAing index in before June or July FOMC and then sell in before September arrives. You could play options or specific stocks but i wont help you with which ones. I prefer index. Charts of the week Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 1 : The 10yr breakevens on the chart are first thing that tops. It tells investors inflation problem is about to happen. Then it's the inflation that starts rising. Now depending upon the inflation level the bond yields rise. More the inflation more the Fed becomes hawkish. Hence at the end its the interest rate that tops. So in a sense 10yr breakevens are the leading indicator for inflation level. Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 2 : The 40 year cycle. We already know that the stock market revolves around a cycle. The 1940 - 1980 cycle in which the bond yields made higher high's and higher low's. And then the 1980 - 2020 cycle where bond yields made a lower high's and lower low's. During the first 40 cycle the interest rate peaked before the bond yields and were more higher in number. In the next 40 cycle the interest rate peaked after the bond yields and were much lower. The Boom Bust cycles XD Observation 3 : ( Don't laugh) So everyone knows how a economy works. I have taken a segment from a way longer cycle of economics passed from generations. ( The 90yr cycle ) We have a period of boom and then we have a period of bust. The boom period from 1980-2020 is over in my opinion where the talk was about globalization Chart : Dow Jones , Orange line : Bond yields , Blue line : Inflation Observation 4 : Let's find out where in history we could be. So high inflation with low bond yields right. So it could be the 1940's or 1948 when Fed decided to kill inflation by raising rates so high that it caused a deflationary period. Result : I have no idea where are we. This experiment was for nothing or maybe it was. But we pose similarity to all of the periods. Disease | Russia wise : 1921 Forgotten depression Chart wise and cycle wise : 1929 depression. Rate, Inflation and bond wise : 1940's. News event wise : 1970's stagflation. Technology and funding wise : 2000 dotcom bubble. WSB wise : 2008 recession. Welcome to the Jungle : Its time for our portfolio building Look guys before we begin let me tell you i am not an expert of fundamental analyzing the companies. But what i am good at is knowing the narratives beforehand and combining it with my technical analysis on stock market where it is headed. But yah of course i do watch earnings and this week is gonna be awesome. Let us begin this unique way of investing. This week : Earnings + FOMC minutes. Hypothesis : If stock valuation relative to others becomes cheap then the algorithms created by big institutions and Hedge funds will buy the stock and sell it quickly or hold according to their analysts or portfolio manger if they are interesting on betting the stock for next cycle. We are going to construct the most knowable portfolio passed down by the generations before. It's called a 60-40% portfolio. But we are gonna make few adjustments to it. Equities : 60% -> 40% USA + 20% international Bonds : 40% -> 30% bonds + 10% metals. We don't take commodities because they are for trading purposes mostly. Step 1 : 10% metals Gold Silver Since we are in 1921, 1929, 1940, 1970, 2000 or 2008. what we know is gold parabolic move is sure to happen. But what we don't know is when to buy gold. We all know in financial crisis gold will fall too or when Powell goes for aggressive rate hike. But it wont capitulate like equities because gold moves slow. It's only in the parabolic moves that gold moves fast. But there are factors that causes it. So the narrative around it will surely come by 2025. Meaning. We buy some now and some portion in crisis. We will add silver too because it will move a lot if Gold goes parabolic.Kinda like how large cap help move small caps. Result : $6 Gold ( $3 right now + $3 in crisis ) + $4 Silver ( $2 right now + $2 in crisis ) Step 2 : 30% bonds. Now this thing is kinda hard to predict and is a matter of preference because there are many types of bonds available. What i will be doing is outperforming those other corporate bonds which gives high return but there are risk associated with it. This chart tell us low yield bonds are about to be bought as compared to high yield risk bonds So I picked TMF for this because i'm chasing high returns with no risk at all. Yes sure its a leveraged ETF but from this chart i know in coming few months most investors will be flocking to longer yield bonds because the growth scare hasn't yet been priced in. Hence the TMF bond will peak because of max euphoria at the end of Q4. My projection are already given in the charts. The only risk to it is change in terminal rates (3.2% aug 2023) or changing the definition of neutral.( 2-3%) TMF ( No income ) = 3 x TLT ( It gives fixed income quarterly ) Result : $15 right now in TMF + $15 ( wait for june TLT ) Step 3 : 60% Equities. Next 60% will be to equities. For this i will picking winner stock with 2025 max profits guarantees. It is up to you guys to decide which winner stock and how much should be in portfolio. And at what price levels are you comfortable with. a) Voldemort class ( These class of stocks are linked to the asset class i cannot name here because i will get banned.

Long term bond buying and equities falling regardless. The White House is now looking to cut corporate greed. Looks like no more price gouging. The unhedged hedge fund Melvin capital is shutting down. You guys did it. David won against Goliath. Identify the difference b/w short covering and bear market rally. Biden meets leaders of Sweden, Finland. Meaning they are going to join NATO this year. We have Monkey pox to deal with. Twitter says it's the courtesy of Bill Gates. Auto loan delinquencies hits highest since 2007. Sam Bank-man Fried bought Robinhood. FTX is about to start stock trading. Meaning if CBDC's by government arrives then petro dollar becomes hetero dollar of trading worldwide. Where we stand Now since many of you guys are new here. Let me bore you once again. We will eventually go into b/w of forgotten depression of 1921 and full blown depression. Depression is just a longer lasting recession. Recession in my opinion will happen later in Q4 because I don't think coming GDP print will be -ve but i think next one and the next one in January will be. Hence i always say when Dow jones hits anywhere b/w 50 MMA - 200 MMA just start DCAing in index ( picking stocks is hard ) like SPX, Nasdaq, DJI. Or if you really wanna buy stocks then go ahead pick the best stocks and DCA ( no one knows the true bottom ) that will last 10yrs. And have patience and conviction. Also we have short term swing trade in indices coming up. We could do this by DCAing index in before June or July FOMC and then sell in before September arrives. You could play options or specific stocks but i wont help you with which ones. I prefer index. Charts of the week Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 1 : The 10yr breakevens on the chart are first thing that tops. It tells investors inflation problem is about to happen. Then it's the inflation that starts rising. Now depending upon the inflation level the bond yields rise. More the inflation more the Fed becomes hawkish. Hence at the end its the interest rate that tops. So in a sense 10yr breakevens are the leading indicator for inflation level. Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 2 : The 40 year cycle. We already know that the stock market revolves around a cycle. The 1940 - 1980 cycle in which the bond yields made higher high's and higher low's. And then the 1980 - 2020 cycle where bond yields made a lower high's and lower low's. During the first 40 cycle the interest rate peaked before the bond yields and were more higher in number. In the next 40 cycle the interest rate peaked after the bond yields and were much lower. The Boom Bust cycles XD Observation 3 : ( Don't laugh) So everyone knows how a economy works. I have taken a segment from a way longer cycle of economics passed from generations. ( The 90yr cycle ) We have a period of boom and then we have a period of bust. The boom period from 1980-2020 is over in my opinion where the talk was about globalization Chart : Dow Jones , Orange line : Bond yields , Blue line : Inflation Observation 4 : Let's find out where in history we could be. So high inflation with low bond yields right. So it could be the 1940's or 1948 when Fed decided to kill inflation by raising rates so high that it caused a deflationary period. Result : I have no idea where are we. This experiment was for nothing or maybe it was. But we pose similarity to all of the periods. Disease | Russia wise : 1921 Forgotten depression Chart wise and cycle wise : 1929 depression. Rate, Inflation and bond wise : 1940's. News event wise : 1970's stagflation. Technology and funding wise : 2000 dotcom bubble. WSB wise : 2008 recession. Welcome to the Jungle : Its time for our portfolio building Look guys before we begin let me tell you i am not an expert of fundamental analyzing the companies. But what i am good at is knowing the narratives beforehand and combining it with my technical analysis on stock market where it is headed. But yah of course i do watch earnings and this week is gonna be awesome. Let us begin this unique way of investing. This week : Earnings + FOMC minutes. Hypothesis : If stock valuation relative to others becomes cheap then the algorithms created by big institutions and Hedge funds will buy the stock and sell it quickly or hold according to their analysts or portfolio manger if they are interesting on betting the stock for next cycle. We are going to construct the most knowable portfolio passed down by the generations before. It's called a 60-40% portfolio. But we are gonna make few adjustments to it. Equities : 60% -> 40% USA + 20% international Bonds : 40% -> 30% bonds + 10% metals. We don't take commodities because they are for trading purposes mostly. Step 1 : 10% metals Gold Silver Since we are in 1921, 1929, 1940, 1970, 2000 or 2008. what we know is gold parabolic move is sure to happen. But what we don't know is when to buy gold. We all know in financial crisis gold will fall too or when Powell goes for aggressive rate hike. But it wont capitulate like equities because gold moves slow. It's only in the parabolic moves that gold moves fast. But there are factors that causes it. So the narrative around it will surely come by 2025. Meaning. We buy some now and some portion in crisis. We will add silver too because it will move a lot if Gold goes parabolic.Kinda like how large cap help move small caps. Result : $6 Gold ( $3 right now + $3 in crisis ) + $4 Silver ( $2 right now + $2 in crisis ) Step 2 : 30% bonds. Now this thing is kinda hard to predict and is a matter of preference because there are many types of bonds available. What i will be doing is outperforming those other corporate bonds which gives high return but there are risk associated with it. This chart tell us low yield bonds are about to be bought as compared to high yield risk bonds So I picked TMF for this because i'm chasing high returns with no risk at all. Yes sure its a leveraged ETF but from this chart i know in coming few months most investors will be flocking to longer yield bonds because the growth scare hasn't yet been priced in. Hence the TMF bond will peak because of max euphoria at the end of Q4. My projection are already given in the charts. The only risk to it is change in terminal rates (3.2% aug 2023) or changing the definition of neutral.( 2-3%) TMF ( No income ) = 3 x TLT ( It gives fixed income quarterly ) Result : $15 right now in TMF + $15 ( wait for june TLT ) Step 3 : 60% Equities. Next 60% will be to equities. For this i will picking winner stock with 2025 max profits guarantees. It is up to you guys to decide which winner stock and how much should be in portfolio. And at what price levels are you comfortable with. a) Voldemort class ( These class of stocks are linked to the asset class i cannot name here because i will get banned. But hey we can name the stocks ) Includes : MTTR, MSTR, COIN, HOOD, HUT8, COIN, Winner : MTTR, COIN Reason : MSTR is bound to get liquidated since saylor is known for crisis like dotcom. HOOD c'mon guys we all hate it. Also Vlad is such a shit CEO. If he gets removed as CEO and Sam Bank man like Elon makes a play for position then heck yes. It could be proxy to investing with FTX. HUT8 hmm. I just don't like mining stocks. Matterport on the other hand has got metaverse play in it. So im expecting it to do a 8x by then and everybody loves Brian. Heck even the SEC too. He's got good leadership skills and would do anything for the company. $40 was such a good deal. Man i missed it. It was trading below its funding valuation and 2x the money they had. b) EV play. Includes : Rivian, Ford, GM, Tesla, Nio, Lucid Winner : Tesla, Nio Reason : I'm going calling the dibs on Tesla even though its price can fall to $380. Coz why won't you wanna have Tesla in your portfolio. Its still got India play left inside it. Yes supply chain are the problems but i believe this company will get help from china. Hence Nio too. So allocate some to Tesla and Nio. Nio because George Soros who broke bank of England is buying heavy. So Hf's or institutions would not even possibly think of shorting this stock. Such is the fear of Soros in Wallstreet. c) Gaming play + Chips Includes : AMD, Intel, Nvidia Winner : Nvidia ( Little partial ) Reason : I am partial to this even though AMD has started producing cheaper and better products and aren't suffering in supply chain as much. Nvidia in my opinion is world class and its products last longer than other products. Also there is a heavy demand by consumers. Nothing will ever change that. It's kinda like Apple of the space. Also its the leading in ml + ai too. I believe Tesla and Nvidia will partner in future. I could be wrong here and hey maybe AMD kicks its butt but i'm gonna go Nvidia. Also AMD has to fight some FUD articles in the future. Its up to you guys to decide. But i sure as hell don't want you to buy intel. d ) Payment play Includes : VISA, Master card, PayPal Winner : Paypal Reason :They are doing so much in Voldomort asset class. VISA wtf are you doing though by joking around with that sh9t. e ) The others Rest guys i believe in peace so no Palantir for me. And since Jamie Dimon is leaving i think JP Morgan will fall. If he stick around till 2025 then i sure as hell would keep this in my portfolio. Also i don't want Ecom in portfolio ( AMZN + Target + Walmart ) but i sure as hell want Google. Its got that growth in slowing economy factor for me. Because who forgets to search on google and play videos on Youtube. And then there is Cathie wood and her Roku. Look guys if she is doing an insider trading and knows something about the company that we don't then sure go all in on that stock only. Also remember the people who created SARKK have launched another ETF called ARKK leveraged 3x. So maybe if money flows around in it like SARKK then hey Roku gets most of the money since its her top holding. Winner : Google + Roku ( On your own level of risk ) f ) International Since China is about to stimulate its economy and Hong Kong basically is under china control then expect the popular stocks over there to grow as well. Includes : BABA, JD, Tencent Winner : BABA, Bytedance ( If it goes public ) Reason : Amazon and Target money will flow here. Also the low PE / PEG ratio is highly attractive. And hey Munger is buying alongside Blackrock and Bridgwater. Remember we chose Nio too. So keep them at 20% and divide yourselves. Note : The winner decision is solely according to me. Also i haven't given the price levels to buy. That is upto you guys to decide. This is not a Financial advise. As for the proof that i am buying here are my positions on some of the things that i went shopping around. Tesla + TMF The amount has not yet been credited yet. Result : It shall be knows until 2024-2025. Conclusion : Fuck i don't know if it will work. But hey if a monkey can beat the stock market so can this monkey too. P.s. I was quite heartbroken on Sunday so i was unable to write anything. Had to drink so much that this time that i couldn't write anything. Liverpool lost the EPL guys. We came so close. Had the Villa hold on for 20 more minutes what a script it would have been. Felt bad for that goalie though and Gerrard. Imagine slipping twice. Next week we kick Real ass in UCL. (Post Hang over post ) With lots of love guys. Thank you. Regards Uchiha",Whatâ€™s your background? Did you do well in stocks?,0,0.56,NEGATIVE,0.96
,"Respected Traders & Investors, I know folks, it's hard. Just hang on for a few more weeks. Okay!!! A fake exit liquidity rally like March FOMC is just around the corner. So please bear with me. I know times are tough, but guys, we have gotta dig deep and stick around. Until then let's have some fun creating a portfolio. A BS story from my dreams. Might as well skip it. ( Especially Tl;Dr folks ) Story about an island doom. Before we begin creating our portfolio, let me tell you all a story. It goes like there was an island in the middle of a huge ocean where everybody was having a blast. Rich people bought their yachts and the common folks brought their gondola boats. Everyday, the rich and common people used to boat around from the island shore to the middle of the ocean for food. The rich guys used their expensive equipment while the common folks used the traditional method of net for hunt. After everyone was done with their hunting, they used to head back to the island. As the night came down, the rich folks partied on their yachts, while the common folks used to party on the island itself and hence sleep in the stone cave passed by generations. As the days continued by, the people now had to go a little further from the day before because they weren't a lot of things left to hunt in the regions they used to before. As they were going far into the ocean, people started seeing many whales emerging from beneath the ocean. They looked kinda sick because they weren't moving a lot. No one knew the reason why they were slowly dying. Some folks saw this as a warning sign so they took off back to their island. But the rich folks didn't care, and so did some common folks. As the day passed by sharks started appearing in one's, two's and three's, and so on. With passing of each day there were more sharks than the previous one. They used to come for those whales and then leave. Slowly, all the whales disappeared, and hence the sharks too. Everyone thought it was all back to normal, so they continued with their hunting. But then came that fateful day when a swarm of sharks, which looked so hungry, started attacking the people in boats. Heck, there were some big hungry sharks that they even attacked the rick folks yacht. So both the common and rich folks tried to boat around back to the island for safety, but they had come so far off this time around. The yachts, though, were fast so they came back quickly, but the gondola boats were slow. Only the few lucky ones survived. It was all silence on the island. Everyone was quite afraid to head back to the far off water. Days past by and slowly we could see the water in the ocean started disappearing. Everybody was in amazement, like they saw some kind of magic, but some folks knew this was just the beginning of the bad days that were about to come. As months passed, the people started becoming angry because they now had to look for food in the jungle which wasn't quite tasteful compared to seafood. The rich folks used to come visit the island jungle, too, and take whatever they pleased.. At first people let it be because they thought the resources of the jungle were in plenty. But slowly, as time passed by they too became scarce. Now people from both sides were really getting angry. Riots started breaking out around b/w rich and common folks. The people started fighting against each other. The situation got so bad that rich folks started burning the places of ordinary folks. To which people replied back by throwing rocks at the yachts. As the years passed by, only the few survived to live the tale and were able to live off of the island's scare resources. As time progressed the water in the ocean started coming back and so were resources of the island that got depleted, replenished as more folks started going around for the hunt. And hence the cycle repeated itself again for 10 or more yrs. Moral of the story : I leave it to you people to decide in the comments section. Also, the last paragraph is kinda my interpretation of what happened. I leave that up to you. Hey, maybe no one survived to live the tale. Streak of losses Recap : 16th May - 20th May The last week was pretty crazy. S&P 500 finally entered its bear market and dropped to almost -22%. whereas the Nasdaq declined about -30% making this market performance as the worst since 1931 ""Great depression"". We also had 7 straight weeks of red which is just behind the March 2001 ""Dotcom crash"" and May 1970 ""Stagflation"". Apple warning : Later i said if Apple looks bad so will Tesla. Because both are cash Hedge. As my viewers already know we talked about Apple and Tesla warning in my last post where i was worried about their charts. So it indeed happened. Apple dropped below its 100 week MA and Tesla got hammered with FUD articles. Elon Musk thinks its a ploy by democrats.. What do y'all think. Tell me about in the comments section. By the way guys I see no one in Wall street bets talk about things before 1987. Why is that ? Everyone just wants to either compare things with recent recession of 2008 or they want the 1987 ""Black Monday"" crash where DOW dropped -20% in a day. I think people are really getting tired of this constant velocity crash with no acceleration to the downside. Some Economists thinks Powell should just rug-pull and kill the economy in a day. Why to wait for 6 months when things can be done in a day. Pretty shitty argument in my opinion cause why would you want to pressure economy in just a single day. Also some other Economists are calling for retail capitulation. I have no idea guys. It could come or not come before June or July FOMC. But it sure is heck is coming in Q4. ( It will be marked by capitulation in retail stocks, ) Hedge funds top Investments I was very lucky last week to have time and watch ""Jeremy Grantham"" and ""Ray Dalio"" my two favorite logical investors together for an online video conference where they talked about their views on economy. Both of them have a pretty different outlook for the future. Ray believes the changing world order is about to happen in this cycle where the China and rest other emerging markets from Asia such as India will boom as compared to USA where we could have a bust. (But his fund has an allocation to FTSE 100. Interesting) Jeremy believes we are in for a dotcom style crash. But both of them don't believe in the idea of recession this year but yeah the risk of stagflation are increasing day by day according to them. Growth in their opinion though will be slowing in the upcoming years. Also do watch ""All in podcast"" show. In latest episode we have a guy who predicted 5 out of the last 3 recessions and invested in We work.ðŸ˜‚ Okay moving on lets summarize key highlights of this week from CNBC television : Jet blue hostile bid for spirit airlines. Boeing is shit. Elon twitter drama. Oil to $150 after china deal. Warren Buffet buying energy and increasing stake in occidental petroleum. Healthcare and energy can be defensive and aggressive play for portfolio managers this year. Netflix upgraded by a bear. Walmart & Target earnings disaster. Retail sales 0.9% est 1% in April. Job cuts in Netflix and HOOD. Hiring freeze in Facebook & COIN. Fin-tech bottom is in according to analysts. Google is good in economic slowdown. Growth scare. Long term bond buying and equities falling regardless. The White House is now looking to cut corporate greed. Looks like no more price gouging. The unhedged hedge fund Melvin capital is shutting down. You guys did it. David won against Goliath. Identify the difference b/w short covering and bear market rally. Biden meets leaders of Sweden, Finland. Meaning they are going to join NATO this year. We have Monkey pox to deal with. Twitter says it's the courtesy of Bill Gates. Auto loan delinquencies hits highest since 2007. Sam Bank-man Fried bought Robinhood. FTX is about to start stock trading.

They used to come for those whales and then leave. Slowly, all the whales disappeared, and hence the sharks too. Everyone thought it was all back to normal, so they continued with their hunting. But then came that fateful day when a swarm of sharks, which looked so hungry, started attacking the people in boats. Heck, there were some big hungry sharks that they even attacked the rick folks yacht. So both the common and rich folks tried to boat around back to the island for safety, but they had come so far off this time around. The yachts, though, were fast so they came back quickly, but the gondola boats were slow. Only the few lucky ones survived. It was all silence on the island. Everyone was quite afraid to head back to the far off water. Days past by and slowly we could see the water in the ocean started disappearing. Everybody was in amazement, like they saw some kind of magic, but some folks knew this was just the beginning of the bad days that were about to come. As months passed, the people started becoming angry because they now had to look for food in the jungle which wasn't quite tasteful compared to seafood. The rich folks used to come visit the island jungle, too, and take whatever they pleased.. At first people let it be because they thought the resources of the jungle were in plenty. But slowly, as time passed by they too became scarce. Now people from both sides were really getting angry. Riots started breaking out around b/w rich and common folks. The people started fighting against each other. The situation got so bad that rich folks started burning the places of ordinary folks. To which people replied back by throwing rocks at the yachts. As the years passed by, only the few survived to live the tale and were able to live off of the island's scare resources. As time progressed the water in the ocean started coming back and so were resources of the island that got depleted, replenished as more folks started going around for the hunt. And hence the cycle repeated itself again for 10 or more yrs. Moral of the story : I leave it to you people to decide in the comments section. Also, the last paragraph is kinda my interpretation of what happened. I leave that up to you. Hey, maybe no one survived to live the tale. Streak of losses Recap : 16th May - 20th May The last week was pretty crazy. S&P 500 finally entered its bear market and dropped to almost -22%. whereas the Nasdaq declined about -30% making this market performance as the worst since 1931 ""Great depression"". We also had 7 straight weeks of red which is just behind the March 2001 ""Dotcom crash"" and May 1970 ""Stagflation"". Apple warning : Later i said if Apple looks bad so will Tesla. Because both are cash Hedge. As my viewers already know we talked about Apple and Tesla warning in my last post where i was worried about their charts. So it indeed happened. Apple dropped below its 100 week MA and Tesla got hammered with FUD articles. Elon Musk thinks its a ploy by democrats.. What do y'all think. Tell me about in the comments section. By the way guys I see no one in Wall street bets talk about things before 1987. Why is that ? Everyone just wants to either compare things with recent recession of 2008 or they want the 1987 ""Black Monday"" crash where DOW dropped -20% in a day. I think people are really getting tired of this constant velocity crash with no acceleration to the downside. Some Economists thinks Powell should just rug-pull and kill the economy in a day. Why to wait for 6 months when things can be done in a day. Pretty shitty argument in my opinion cause why would you want to pressure economy in just a single day. Also some other Economists are calling for retail capitulation. I have no idea guys. It could come or not come before June or July FOMC. But it sure is heck is coming in Q4. ( It will be marked by capitulation in retail stocks, ) Hedge funds top Investments I was very lucky last week to have time and watch ""Jeremy Grantham"" and ""Ray Dalio"" my two favorite logical investors together for an online video conference where they talked about their views on economy. Both of them have a pretty different outlook for the future. Ray believes the changing world order is about to happen in this cycle where the China and rest other emerging markets from Asia such as India will boom as compared to USA where we could have a bust. (But his fund has an allocation to FTSE 100. Interesting) Jeremy believes we are in for a dotcom style crash. But both of them don't believe in the idea of recession this year but yeah the risk of stagflation are increasing day by day according to them. Growth in their opinion though will be slowing in the upcoming years. Also do watch ""All in podcast"" show. In latest episode we have a guy who predicted 5 out of the last 3 recessions and invested in We work.ðŸ˜‚ Okay moving on lets summarize key highlights of this week from CNBC television : Jet blue hostile bid for spirit airlines. Boeing is shit. Elon twitter drama. Oil to $150 after china deal. Warren Buffet buying energy and increasing stake in occidental petroleum. Healthcare and energy can be defensive and aggressive play for portfolio managers this year. Netflix upgraded by a bear. Walmart & Target earnings disaster. Retail sales 0.9% est 1% in April. Job cuts in Netflix and HOOD. Hiring freeze in Facebook & COIN. Fin-tech bottom is in according to analysts. Google is good in economic slowdown. Growth scare. Long term bond buying and equities falling regardless. The White House is now looking to cut corporate greed. Looks like no more price gouging. The unhedged hedge fund Melvin capital is shutting down. You guys did it. David won against Goliath. Identify the difference b/w short covering and bear market rally. Biden meets leaders of Sweden, Finland. Meaning they are going to join NATO this year. We have Monkey pox to deal with. Twitter says it's the courtesy of Bill Gates. Auto loan delinquencies hits highest since 2007. Sam Bank-man Fried bought Robinhood. FTX is about to start stock trading. Meaning if CBDC's by government arrives then petro dollar becomes hetero dollar of trading worldwide. Where we stand Now since many of you guys are new here. Let me bore you once again. We will eventually go into b/w of forgotten depression of 1921 and full blown depression. Depression is just a longer lasting recession. Recession in my opinion will happen later in Q4 because I don't think coming GDP print will be -ve but i think next one and the next one in January will be. Hence i always say when Dow jones hits anywhere b/w 50 MMA - 200 MMA just start DCAing in index ( picking stocks is hard ) like SPX, Nasdaq, DJI. Or if you really wanna buy stocks then go ahead pick the best stocks and DCA ( no one knows the true bottom ) that will last 10yrs. And have patience and conviction. Also we have short term swing trade in indices coming up. We could do this by DCAing index in before June or July FOMC and then sell in before September arrives. You could play options or specific stocks but i wont help you with which ones. I prefer index. Charts of the week Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 1 : The 10yr breakevens on the chart are first thing that tops. It tells investors inflation problem is about to happen. Then it's the inflation that starts rising. Now depending upon the inflation level the bond yields rise. More the inflation more the Fed becomes hawkish. Hence at the end its the interest rate that tops. So in a sense 10yr breakevens are the leading indicator for inflation level. Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 2 : The 40 year cycle. We already know that the stock market revolves around a cycle. The 1940 - 1980 cycle in which the bond yields made higher high's and higher low's. And then the 1980 - 2020 cycle where bond yields made a lower high's and lower low's. During the first 40 cycle the interest rate peaked before the bond yields and were more higher in number. In the next 40 cycle the interest rate peaked after the bond yields and were much lower. The Boom Bust cycles XD Observation 3 : ( Don't laugh) So everyone knows how a economy works. I have taken a segment from a way longer cycle of economics passed from generations. ( The 90yr cycle ) We have a period of boom and then we have a period of bust. The boom period from 1980-2020 is over in my opinion where the talk was about globalization Chart : Dow Jones , Orange line : Bond yields , Blue line : Inflation Observation 4 : Let's find out where in history we could be. So high inflation with low bond yields right. So it could be the 1940's or 1948 when Fed decided to kill inflation by raising rates so high that it caused a deflationary period. Result : I have no idea where are we. This experiment was for nothing or maybe it was. But we pose similarity to all of the periods. Disease | Russia wise : 1921 Forgotten depression Chart wise and cycle wise : 1929 depression. Rate, Inflation and bond wise : 1940's. News event wise : 1970's stagflation. Technology and funding wise : 2000 dotcom bubble. WSB wise : 2008 recession. Welcome to the Jungle : Its time for our portfolio building Look guys before we begin let me tell you i am not an expert of fundamental analyzing the companies. But what i am good at is knowing the narratives beforehand and combining it with my technical analysis on stock market where it is headed. But yah of course i do watch earnings and this week is gonna be awesome. Let us begin this unique way of investing. This week : Earnings + FOMC minutes. Hypothesis : If stock valuation relative to others becomes cheap then the algorithms created by big institutions and Hedge funds will buy the stock and sell it quickly or hold according to their analysts or portfolio manger if they are interesting on betting the stock for next cycle. We are going to construct the most knowable portfolio passed down by the generations before. It's called a 60-40% portfolio. But we are gonna make few adjustments to it. Equities : 60% -> 40% USA + 20% international Bonds : 40% -> 30% bonds + 10% metals. We don't take commodities because they are for trading purposes mostly. Step 1 : 10% metals Gold Silver Since we are in 1921, 1929, 1940, 1970, 2000 or 2008. what we know is gold parabolic move is sure to happen. But what we don't know is when to buy gold. We all know in financial crisis gold will fall too or when Powell goes for aggressive rate hike. But it wont capitulate like equities because gold moves slow. It's only in the parabolic moves that gold moves fast. But there are factors that causes it. So the narrative around it will surely come by 2025. Meaning. We buy some now and some portion in crisis. We will add silver too because it will move a lot if Gold goes parabolic.Kinda like how large cap help move small caps. Result : $6 Gold ( $3 right now + $3 in crisis ) + $4 Silver ( $2 right now + $2 in crisis ) Step 2 : 30% bonds. Now this thing is kinda hard to predict and is a matter of preference because there are many types of bonds available. What i will be doing is outperforming those other corporate bonds which gives high return but there are risk associated with it. This chart tell us low yield bonds are about to be bought as compared to high yield risk bonds So I picked TMF for this because i'm chasing high returns with no risk at all. Yes sure its a leveraged ETF but from this chart i know in coming few months most investors will be flocking to longer yield bonds because the growth scare hasn't yet been priced in. Hence the TMF bond will peak because of max euphoria at the end of Q4. My projection are already given in the charts. The only risk to it is change in terminal rates (3.2% aug 2023) or changing the definition of neutral.( 2-3%) TMF ( No income ) = 3 x TLT ( It gives fixed income quarterly ) Result : $15 right now in TMF + $15 ( wait for june TLT ) Step 3 : 60% Equities. Next 60% will be to equities. For this i will picking winner stock with 2025 max profits guarantees. It is up to you guys to decide which winner stock and how much should be in portfolio. And at what price levels are you comfortable with. a) Voldemort class ( These class of stocks are linked to the asset class i cannot name here because i will get banned. But hey we can name the stocks ) Includes : MTTR, MSTR, COIN, HOOD, HUT8, COIN, Winner : MTTR, COIN Reason : MSTR is bound to get liquidated since saylor is known for crisis like dotcom. HOOD c'mon guys we all hate it. Also Vlad is such a shit CEO. If he gets removed as CEO and Sam Bank man like Elon makes a play for position then heck yes. It could be proxy to investing with FTX. HUT8 hmm. I just don't like mining stocks. Matterport on the other hand has got metaverse play in it. So im expecting it to do a 8x by then and everybody loves Brian. Heck even the SEC too. He's got good leadership skills and would do anything for the company. $40 was such a good deal. Man i missed it. It was trading below its funding valuation and 2x the money they had. b) EV play. Includes : Rivian, Ford, GM, Tesla, Nio, Lucid Winner : Tesla, Nio Reason : I'm going calling the dibs on Tesla even though its price can fall to $380. Coz why won't you wanna have Tesla in your portfolio. Its still got India play left inside it. Yes supply chain are the problems but i believe this company will get help from china. Hence Nio too. So allocate some to Tesla and Nio. Nio because George Soros who broke bank of England is buying heavy. So Hf's or institutions would not even possibly think of shorting this stock. Such is the fear of Soros in Wallstreet. c) Gaming play + Chips Includes : AMD, Intel, Nvidia Winner : Nvidia ( Little partial ) Reason : I am partial to this even though AMD has started producing cheaper and better products and aren't suffering in supply chain as much. Nvidia in my opinion is world class and its products last longer than other products. Also there is a heavy demand by consumers. Nothing will ever change that. It's kinda like Apple of the space. Also its the leading in ml + ai too. I believe Tesla and Nvidia will partner in future. I could be wrong here and hey maybe AMD kicks its butt but i'm gonna go Nvidia. Also AMD has to fight some FUD articles in the future. Its up to you guys to decide. But i sure as hell don't want you to buy intel. d ) Payment play Includes : VISA, Master card, PayPal Winner : Paypal Reason :They are doing so much in Voldomort asset class. VISA wtf are you doing though by joking around with that sh9t. e ) The others Rest guys i believe in peace so no Palantir for me. And since Jamie Dimon is leaving i think JP Morgan will fall. If he stick around till 2025 then i sure as hell would keep this in my portfolio. Also i don't want Ecom in portfolio ( AMZN + Target + Walmart ) but i sure as hell want Google. Its got that growth in slowing economy factor for me. Because who forgets to search on google and play videos on Youtube. And then there is Cathie wood and her Roku. Look guys if she is doing an insider trading and knows something about the company that we don't then sure go all in on that stock only. Also remember the people who created SARKK have launched another ETF called ARKK leveraged 3x. So maybe if money flows around in it like SARKK then hey Roku gets most of the money since its her top holding. Winner : Google + Roku ( On your own level of risk ) f ) International Since China is about to stimulate its economy and Hong Kong basically is under china control then expect the popular stocks over there to grow as well. Includes : BABA, JD, Tencent Winner : BABA, Bytedance ( If it goes public ) Reason : Amazon and Target money will flow here. Also the low PE / PEG ratio is highly attractive. And hey Munger is buying alongside Blackrock and Bridgwater. Remember we chose Nio too. So keep them at 20% and divide yourselves. Note : The winner decision is solely according to me. Also i haven't given the price levels to buy. That is upto you guys to decide. This is not a Financial advise. As for the proof that i am buying here are my positions on some of the things that i went shopping around. Tesla + TMF The amount has not yet been credited yet. Result : It shall be knows until 2024-2025. Conclusion : Fuck i don't know if it will work. But hey if a monkey can beat the stock market so can this monkey too. P.s. I was quite heartbroken on Sunday so i was unable to write anything. Had to drink so much that this time that i couldn't write anything. Liverpool lost the EPL guys. We came so close. Had the Villa hold on for 20 more minutes what a script it would have been. Felt bad for that goalie though and Gerrard. Imagine slipping twice. Next week we kick Real ass in UCL. (Post Hang over post ) With lots of love guys. Thank you. Regards Uchiha",Do you think the current rally we're seeing is going to carry to june?,0,0.521,NEGATIVE,0.922
,"Respected Traders & Investors, I know folks, it's hard. Just hang on for a few more weeks. Okay!!! A fake exit liquidity rally like March FOMC is just around the corner. So please bear with me. I know times are tough, but guys, we have gotta dig deep and stick around. Until then let's have some fun creating a portfolio. A BS story from my dreams. Might as well skip it. ( Especially Tl;Dr folks ) Story about an island doom. Before we begin creating our portfolio, let me tell you all a story. It goes like there was an island in the middle of a huge ocean where everybody was having a blast. Rich people bought their yachts and the common folks brought their gondola boats. Everyday, the rich and common people used to boat around from the island shore to the middle of the ocean for food. The rich guys used their expensive equipment while the common folks used the traditional method of net for hunt. After everyone was done with their hunting, they used to head back to the island. As the night came down, the rich folks partied on their yachts, while the common folks used to party on the island itself and hence sleep in the stone cave passed by generations. As the days continued by, the people now had to go a little further from the day before because they weren't a lot of things left to hunt in the regions they used to before. As they were going far into the ocean, people started seeing many whales emerging from beneath the ocean. They looked kinda sick because they weren't moving a lot. No one knew the reason why they were slowly dying. Some folks saw this as a warning sign so they took off back to their island. But the rich folks didn't care, and so did some common folks. As the day passed by sharks started appearing in one's, two's and three's, and so on. With passing of each day there were more sharks than the previous one.

Everybody was in amazement, like they saw some kind of magic, but some folks knew this was just the beginning of the bad days that were about to come.

The rich folks used to come visit the island jungle, too, and take whatever they pleased.. At first people let it be because they thought the resources of the jungle were in plenty. But slowly, as time passed by they too became scarce. Now people from both sides were really getting angry. Riots started breaking out around b/w rich and common folks.

Nvidia in my opinion is world class and its products last longer than other products. Also there is a heavy demand by consumers. Nothing will ever change that. It's kinda like Apple of the space. Also its the leading in ml + ai too. I believe Tesla and Nvidia will partner in future. I could be wrong here and hey maybe AMD kicks its butt but i'm gonna go Nvidia. Also AMD has to fight some FUD articles in the future. Its up to you guys to decide. But i sure as hell don't want you to buy intel. d ) Payment play Includes : VISA, Master card, PayPal Winner : Paypal Reason :They are doing so much in Voldomort asset class. VISA wtf are you doing though by joking around with that sh9t. e ) The others Rest guys i believe in peace so no Palantir for me. And since Jamie Dimon is leaving i think JP Morgan will fall. If he stick around till 2025 then i sure as hell would keep this in my portfolio. Also i don't want Ecom in portfolio ( AMZN + Target + Walmart ) but i sure as hell want Google. Its got that growth in slowing economy factor for me. Because who forgets to search on google and play videos on Youtube. And then there is Cathie wood and her Roku. Look guys if she is doing an insider trading and knows something about the company that we don't then sure go all in on that stock only. Also remember the people who created SARKK have launched another ETF called ARKK leveraged 3x. So maybe if money flows around in it like SARKK then hey Roku gets most of the money since its her top holding. Winner : Google + Roku ( On your own level of risk ) f ) International Since China is about to stimulate its economy and Hong Kong basically is under china control then expect the popular stocks over there to grow as well. Includes : BABA, JD, Tencent Winner : BABA, Bytedance ( If it goes public ) Reason : Amazon and Target money will flow here. Also the low PE / PEG ratio is highly attractive. And hey Munger is buying alongside Blackrock and Bridgwater. Remember we chose Nio too. So keep them at 20% and divide yourselves. Note : The winner decision is solely according to me. Also i haven't given the price levels to buy. That is upto you guys to decide. This is not a Financial advise. As for the proof that i am buying here are my positions on some of the things that i went shopping around. Tesla + TMF The amount has not yet been credited yet. Result : It shall be knows until 2024-2025. Conclusion : Fuck i don't know if it will work. But hey if a monkey can beat the stock market so can this monkey too. P.s. I was quite heartbroken on Sunday so i was unable to write anything. Had to drink so much that this time that i couldn't write anything. Liverpool lost the EPL guys. We came so close. Had the Villa hold on for 20 more minutes what a script it would have been. Felt bad for that goalie though and Gerrard. Imagine slipping twice. Next week we kick Real ass in UCL. (Post Hang over post ) With lots of love guys. Thank you. Regards Uchiha",Well there is a rally coming post june fomc or july. But it would be a bear market rally similar to march and then capitulation monthly candle starts sept-feb.,1,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.831
,"Respected Traders & Investors, I know folks, it's hard. Just hang on for a few more weeks. Okay!!! A fake exit liquidity rally like March FOMC is just around the corner. So please bear with me. I know times are tough, but guys, we have gotta dig deep and stick around. Until then let's have some fun creating a portfolio. A BS story from my dreams. Might as well skip it. ( Especially Tl;Dr folks ) Story about an island doom. Before we begin creating our portfolio, let me tell you all a story. It goes like there was an island in the middle of a huge ocean where everybody was having a blast. Rich people bought their yachts and the common folks brought their gondola boats. Everyday, the rich and common people used to boat around from the island shore to the middle of the ocean for food. The rich guys used their expensive equipment while the common folks used the traditional method of net for hunt. After everyone was done with their hunting, they used to head back to the island. As the night came down, the rich folks partied on their yachts, while the common folks used to party on the island itself and hence sleep in the stone cave passed by generations. As the days continued by, the people now had to go a little further from the day before because they weren't a lot of things left to hunt in the regions they used to before. As they were going far into the ocean, people started seeing many whales emerging from beneath the ocean. They looked kinda sick because they weren't moving a lot. No one knew the reason why they were slowly dying. Some folks saw this as a warning sign so they took off back to their island. But the rich folks didn't care, and so did some common folks. As the day passed by sharks started appearing in one's, two's and three's, and so on. With passing of each day there were more sharks than the previous one. They used to come for those whales and then leave. Slowly, all the whales disappeared, and hence the sharks too. Everyone thought it was all back to normal, so they continued with their hunting. But then came that fateful day when a swarm of sharks, which looked so hungry, started attacking the people in boats. Heck, there were some big hungry sharks that they even attacked the rick folks yacht. So both the common and rich folks tried to boat around back to the island for safety, but they had come so far off this time around. The yachts, though, were fast so they came back quickly, but the gondola boats were slow. Only the few lucky ones survived. It was all silence on the island. Everyone was quite afraid to head back to the far off water. Days past by and slowly we could see the water in the ocean started disappearing. Everybody was in amazement, like they saw some kind of magic, but some folks knew this was just the beginning of the bad days that were about to come. As months passed, the people started becoming angry because they now had to look for food in the jungle which wasn't quite tasteful compared to seafood. The rich folks used to come visit the island jungle, too, and take whatever they pleased.. At first people let it be because they thought the resources of the jungle were in plenty. But slowly, as time passed by they too became scarce. Now people from both sides were really getting angry. Riots started breaking out around b/w rich and common folks. The people started fighting against each other. The situation got so bad that rich folks started burning the places of ordinary folks. To which people replied back by throwing rocks at the yachts. As the years passed by, only the few survived to live the tale and were able to live off of the island's scare resources. As time progressed the water in the ocean started coming back and so were resources of the island that got depleted, replenished as more folks started going around for the hunt. And hence the cycle repeated itself again for 10 or more yrs. Moral of the story : I leave it to you people to decide in the comments section. Also, the last paragraph is kinda my interpretation of what happened. I leave that up to you. Hey, maybe no one survived to live the tale. Streak of losses Recap : 16th May - 20th May The last week was pretty crazy. S&P 500 finally entered its bear market and dropped to almost -22%. whereas the Nasdaq declined about -30% making this market performance as the worst since 1931 ""Great depression"". We also had 7 straight weeks of red which is just behind the March 2001 ""Dotcom crash"" and May 1970 ""Stagflation"". Apple warning : Later i said if Apple looks bad so will Tesla. Because both are cash Hedge. As my viewers already know we talked about Apple and Tesla warning in my last post where i was worried about their charts. So it indeed happened. Apple dropped below its 100 week MA and Tesla got hammered with FUD articles. Elon Musk thinks its a ploy by democrats.. What do y'all think. Tell me about in the comments section. By the way guys I see no one in Wall street bets talk about things before 1987. Why is that ? Everyone just wants to either compare things with recent recession of 2008 or they want the 1987 ""Black Monday"" crash where DOW dropped -20% in a day. I think people are really getting tired of this constant velocity crash with no acceleration to the downside. Some Economists thinks Powell should just rug-pull and kill the economy in a day. Why to wait for 6 months when things can be done in a day. Pretty shitty argument in my opinion cause why would you want to pressure economy in just a single day. Also some other Economists are calling for retail capitulation. I have no idea guys. It could come or not come before June or July FOMC. But it sure is heck is coming in Q4. ( It will be marked by capitulation in retail stocks, ) Hedge funds top Investments I was very lucky last week to have time and watch ""Jeremy Grantham"" and ""Ray Dalio"" my two favorite logical investors together for an online video conference where they talked about their views on economy. Both of them have a pretty different outlook for the future. Ray believes the changing world order is about to happen in this cycle where the China and rest other emerging markets from Asia such as India will boom as compared to USA where we could have a bust. (But his fund has an allocation to FTSE 100. Interesting) Jeremy believes we are in for a dotcom style crash. But both of them don't believe in the idea of recession this year but yeah the risk of stagflation are increasing day by day according to them. Growth in their opinion though will be slowing in the upcoming years. Also do watch ""All in podcast"" show. In latest episode we have a guy who predicted 5 out of the last 3 recessions and invested in We work.ðŸ˜‚ Okay moving on lets summarize key highlights of this week from CNBC television : Jet blue hostile bid for spirit airlines. Boeing is shit. Elon twitter drama. Oil to $150 after china deal. Warren Buffet buying energy and increasing stake in occidental petroleum. Healthcare and energy can be defensive and aggressive play for portfolio managers this year. Netflix upgraded by a bear. Walmart & Target earnings disaster. Retail sales 0.9% est 1% in April. Job cuts in Netflix and HOOD. Hiring freeze in Facebook & COIN. Fin-tech bottom is in according to analysts. Google is good in economic slowdown. Growth scare. Long term bond buying and equities falling regardless. The White House is now looking to cut corporate greed. Looks like no more price gouging. The unhedged hedge fund Melvin capital is shutting down. You guys did it. David won against Goliath. Identify the difference b/w short covering and bear market rally. Biden meets leaders of Sweden, Finland. Meaning they are going to join NATO this year. We have Monkey pox to deal with. Twitter says it's the courtesy of Bill Gates. Auto loan delinquencies hits highest since 2007. Sam Bank-man Fried bought Robinhood. FTX is about to start stock trading. Meaning if CBDC's by government arrives then petro dollar becomes hetero dollar of trading worldwide. Where we stand Now since many of you guys are new here. Let me bore you once again. We will eventually go into b/w of forgotten depression of 1921 and full blown depression. Depression is just a longer lasting recession. Recession in my opinion will happen later in Q4 because I don't think coming GDP print will be -ve but i think next one and the next one in January will be. Hence i always say when Dow jones hits anywhere b/w 50 MMA - 200 MMA just start DCAing in index ( picking stocks is hard ) like SPX, Nasdaq, DJI. Or if you really wanna buy stocks then go ahead pick the best stocks and DCA ( no one knows the true bottom ) that will last 10yrs. And have patience and conviction. Also we have short term swing trade in indices coming up. We could do this by DCAing index in before June or July FOMC and then sell in before September arrives. You could play options or specific stocks but i wont help you with which ones. I prefer index. Charts of the week Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 1 : The 10yr breakevens on the chart are first thing that tops. It tells investors inflation problem is about to happen. Then it's the inflation that starts rising. Now depending upon the inflation level the bond yields rise. More the inflation more the Fed becomes hawkish. Hence at the end its the interest rate that tops. So in a sense 10yr breakevens are the leading indicator for inflation level. Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 2 : The 40 year cycle. We already know that the stock market revolves around a cycle. The 1940 - 1980 cycle in which the bond yields made higher high's and higher low's. And then the 1980 - 2020 cycle where bond yields made a lower high's and lower low's. During the first 40 cycle the interest rate peaked before the bond yields and were more higher in number. In the next 40 cycle the interest rate peaked after the bond yields and were much lower. The Boom Bust cycles XD Observation 3 : ( Don't laugh) So everyone knows how a economy works. I have taken a segment from a way longer cycle of economics passed from generations. ( The 90yr cycle ) We have a period of boom and then we have a period of bust. The boom period from 1980-2020 is over in my opinion where the talk was about globalization Chart : Dow Jones , Orange line : Bond yields , Blue line : Inflation Observation 4 : Let's find out where in history we could be. So high inflation with low bond yields right. So it could be the 1940's or 1948 when Fed decided to kill inflation by raising rates so high that it caused a deflationary period. Result : I have no idea where are we. This experiment was for nothing or maybe it was. But we pose similarity to all of the periods. Disease | Russia wise : 1921 Forgotten depression Chart wise and cycle wise : 1929 depression. Rate, Inflation and bond wise : 1940's. News event wise : 1970's stagflation. Technology and funding wise : 2000 dotcom bubble. WSB wise : 2008 recession. Welcome to the Jungle : Its time for our portfolio building Look guys before we begin let me tell you i am not an expert of fundamental analyzing the companies. But what i am good at is knowing the narratives beforehand and combining it with my technical analysis on stock market where it is headed. But yah of course i do watch earnings and this week is gonna be awesome. Let us begin this unique way of investing. This week : Earnings + FOMC minutes. Hypothesis : If stock valuation relative to others becomes cheap then the algorithms created by big institutions and Hedge funds will buy the stock and sell it quickly or hold according to their analysts or portfolio manger if they are interesting on betting the stock for next cycle. We are going to construct the most knowable portfolio passed down by the generations before. It's called a 60-40% portfolio. But we are gonna make few adjustments to it. Equities : 60% -> 40% USA + 20% international Bonds : 40% -> 30% bonds + 10% metals. We don't take commodities because they are for trading purposes mostly. Step 1 : 10% metals Gold Silver Since we are in 1921, 1929, 1940, 1970, 2000 or 2008. what we know is gold parabolic move is sure to happen. But what we don't know is when to buy gold. We all know in financial crisis gold will fall too or when Powell goes for aggressive rate hike. But it wont capitulate like equities because gold moves slow. It's only in the parabolic moves that gold moves fast. But there are factors that causes it. So the narrative around it will surely come by 2025. Meaning. We buy some now and some portion in crisis. We will add silver too because it will move a lot if Gold goes parabolic.Kinda like how large cap help move small caps. Result : $6 Gold ( $3 right now + $3 in crisis ) + $4 Silver ( $2 right now + $2 in crisis ) Step 2 : 30% bonds. Now this thing is kinda hard to predict and is a matter of preference because there are many types of bonds available. What i will be doing is outperforming those other corporate bonds which gives high return but there are risk associated with it. This chart tell us low yield bonds are about to be bought as compared to high yield risk bonds So I picked TMF for this because i'm chasing high returns with no risk at all. Yes sure its a leveraged ETF but from this chart i know in coming few months most investors will be flocking to longer yield bonds because the growth scare hasn't yet been priced in. Hence the TMF bond will peak because of max euphoria at the end of Q4. My projection are already given in the charts. The only risk to it is change in terminal rates (3.2% aug 2023) or changing the definition of neutral.( 2-3%) TMF ( No income ) = 3 x TLT ( It gives fixed income quarterly ) Result : $15 right now in TMF + $15 ( wait for june TLT ) Step 3 : 60% Equities. Next 60% will be to equities. For this i will picking winner stock with 2025 max profits guarantees. It is up to you guys to decide which winner stock and how much should be in portfolio. And at what price levels are you comfortable with. a) Voldemort class ( These class of stocks are linked to the asset class i cannot name here because i will get banned. But hey we can name the stocks ) Includes : MTTR, MSTR, COIN, HOOD, HUT8, COIN, Winner : MTTR, COIN Reason : MSTR is bound to get liquidated since saylor is known for crisis like dotcom. HOOD c'mon guys we all hate it. Also Vlad is such a shit CEO. If he gets removed as CEO and Sam Bank man like Elon makes a play for position then heck yes. It could be proxy to investing with FTX. HUT8 hmm. I just don't like mining stocks. Matterport on the other hand has got metaverse play in it. So im expecting it to do a 8x by then and everybody loves Brian. Heck even the SEC too. He's got good leadership skills and would do anything for the company. $40 was such a good deal. Man i missed it. It was trading below its funding valuation and 2x the money they had. b) EV play. Includes : Rivian, Ford, GM, Tesla, Nio, Lucid Winner : Tesla, Nio Reason : I'm going calling the dibs on Tesla even though its price can fall to $380. Coz why won't you wanna have Tesla in your portfolio. Its still got India play left inside it. Yes supply chain are the problems but i believe this company will get help from china. Hence Nio too. So allocate some to Tesla and Nio. Nio because George Soros who broke bank of England is buying heavy. So Hf's or institutions would not even possibly think of shorting this stock. Such is the fear of Soros in Wallstreet. c) Gaming play + Chips Includes : AMD, Intel, Nvidia Winner : Nvidia ( Little partial ) Reason : I am partial to this even though AMD has started producing cheaper and better products and aren't suffering in supply chain as much. Nvidia in my opinion is world class and its products last longer than other products. Also there is a heavy demand by consumers. Nothing will ever change that. It's kinda like Apple of the space. Also its the leading in ml + ai too. I believe Tesla and Nvidia will partner in future. I could be wrong here and hey maybe AMD kicks its butt but i'm gonna go Nvidia. Also AMD has to fight some FUD articles in the future. Its up to you guys to decide. But i sure as hell don't want you to buy intel. d ) Payment play Includes : VISA, Master card, PayPal Winner : Paypal Reason :They are doing so much in Voldomort asset class. VISA wtf are you doing though by joking around with that sh9t. e ) The others Rest guys i believe in peace so no Palantir for me. And since Jamie Dimon is leaving i think JP Morgan will fall. If he stick around till 2025 then i sure as hell would keep this in my portfolio. Also i don't want Ecom in portfolio ( AMZN + Target + Walmart ) but i sure as hell want Google. Its got that growth in slowing economy factor for me. Because who forgets to search on google and play videos on Youtube. And then there is Cathie wood and her Roku. Look guys if she is doing an insider trading and knows something about the company that we don't then sure go all in on that stock only. Also remember the people who created SARKK have launched another ETF called ARKK leveraged 3x. So maybe if money flows around in it like SARKK then hey Roku gets most of the money since its her top holding. Winner : Google + Roku ( On your own level of risk ) f ) International Since China is about to stimulate its economy and Hong Kong basically is under china control then expect the popular stocks over there to grow as well. Includes : BABA, JD, Tencent Winner : BABA, Bytedance ( If it goes public ) Reason : Amazon and Target money will flow here. Also the low PE / PEG ratio is highly attractive. And hey Munger is buying alongside Blackrock and Bridgwater. Remember we chose Nio too. So keep them at 20% and divide yourselves. Note : The winner decision is solely according to me. Also i haven't given the price levels to buy. That is upto you guys to decide. This is not a Financial advise.

I was quite heartbroken on Sunday so i was unable to write anything. Had to drink so much that this time that i couldn't write anything. Liverpool lost the EPL guys. We came so close.

Technology and funding wise : 2000 dotcom bubble. WSB wise : 2008 recession. Welcome to the Jungle : Its time for our portfolio building Look guys before we begin let me tell you i am not an expert of fundamental analyzing the companies. But what i am good at is knowing the narratives beforehand and combining it with my technical analysis on stock market where it is headed. But yah of course i do watch earnings and this week is gonna be awesome. Let us begin this unique way of investing. This week : Earnings + FOMC minutes. Hypothesis : If stock valuation relative to others becomes cheap then the algorithms created by big institutions and Hedge funds will buy the stock and sell it quickly or hold according to their analysts or portfolio manger if they are interesting on betting the stock for next cycle. We are going to construct the most knowable portfolio passed down by the generations before. It's called a 60-40% portfolio. But we are gonna make few adjustments to it. Equities : 60% -> 40% USA + 20% international Bonds : 40% -> 30% bonds + 10% metals. We don't take commodities because they are for trading purposes mostly. Step 1 : 10% metals Gold Silver Since we are in 1921, 1929, 1940, 1970, 2000 or 2008. what we know is gold parabolic move is sure to happen. But what we don't know is when to buy gold. We all know in financial crisis gold will fall too or when Powell goes for aggressive rate hike. But it wont capitulate like equities because gold moves slow. It's only in the parabolic moves that gold moves fast. But there are factors that causes it. So the narrative around it will surely come by 2025. Meaning. We buy some now and some portion in crisis. We will add silver too because it will move a lot if Gold goes parabolic.Kinda like how large cap help move small caps. Result : $6 Gold ( $3 right now + $3 in crisis ) + $4 Silver ( $2 right now + $2 in crisis ) Step 2 : 30% bonds. Now this thing is kinda hard to predict and is a matter of preference because there are many types of bonds available. What i will be doing is outperforming those other corporate bonds which gives high return but there are risk associated with it. This chart tell us low yield bonds are about to be bought as compared to high yield risk bonds So I picked TMF for this because i'm chasing high returns with no risk at all. Yes sure its a leveraged ETF but from this chart i know in coming few months most investors will be flocking to longer yield bonds because the growth scare hasn't yet been priced in. Hence the TMF bond will peak because of max euphoria at the end of Q4. My projection are already given in the charts. The only risk to it is change in terminal rates (3.2% aug 2023) or changing the definition of neutral.( 2-3%) TMF ( No income ) = 3 x TLT ( It gives fixed income quarterly ) Result : $15 right now in TMF + $15 ( wait for june TLT ) Step 3 : 60% Equities. Next 60% will be to equities. For this i will picking winner stock with 2025 max profits guarantees. It is up to you guys to decide which winner stock and how much should be in portfolio. And at what price levels are you comfortable with. a) Voldemort class ( These class of stocks are linked to the asset class i cannot name here because i will get banned. But hey we can name the stocks ) Includes : MTTR, MSTR, COIN, HOOD, HUT8, COIN, Winner : MTTR, COIN Reason : MSTR is bound to get liquidated since saylor is known for crisis like dotcom. HOOD c'mon guys we all hate it. Also Vlad is such a shit CEO. If he gets removed as CEO and Sam Bank man like Elon makes a play for position then heck yes. It could be proxy to investing with FTX. HUT8 hmm. I just don't like mining stocks. Matterport on the other hand has got metaverse play in it. So im expecting it to do a 8x by then and everybody loves Brian. Heck even the SEC too. He's got good leadership skills and would do anything for the company. $40 was such a good deal. Man i missed it. It was trading below its funding valuation and 2x the money they had. b) EV play. Includes : Rivian, Ford, GM, Tesla, Nio, Lucid Winner : Tesla, Nio Reason : I'm going calling the dibs on Tesla even though its price can fall to $380. Coz why won't you wanna have Tesla in your portfolio. Its still got India play left inside it. Yes supply chain are the problems but i believe this company will get help from china. Hence Nio too. So allocate some to Tesla and Nio. Nio because George Soros who broke bank of England is buying heavy. So Hf's or institutions would not even possibly think of shorting this stock. Such is the fear of Soros in Wallstreet. c) Gaming play + Chips Includes : AMD, Intel, Nvidia Winner : Nvidia ( Little partial ) Reason : I am partial to this even though AMD has started producing cheaper and better products and aren't suffering in supply chain as much. Nvidia in my opinion is world class and its products last longer than other products. Also there is a heavy demand by consumers. Nothing will ever change that. It's kinda like Apple of the space. Also its the leading in ml + ai too. I believe Tesla and Nvidia will partner in future. I could be wrong here and hey maybe AMD kicks its butt but i'm gonna go Nvidia. Also AMD has to fight some FUD articles in the future. Its up to you guys to decide. But i sure as hell don't want you to buy intel. d ) Payment play Includes : VISA, Master card, PayPal Winner : Paypal Reason :They are doing so much in Voldomort asset class. VISA wtf are you doing though by joking around with that sh9t. e ) The others Rest guys i believe in peace so no Palantir for me. And since Jamie Dimon is leaving i think JP Morgan will fall. If he stick around till 2025 then i sure as hell would keep this in my portfolio. Also i don't want Ecom in portfolio ( AMZN + Target + Walmart ) but i sure as hell want Google. Its got that growth in slowing economy factor for me. Because who forgets to search on google and play videos on Youtube. And then there is Cathie wood and her Roku. Look guys if she is doing an insider trading and knows something about the company that we don't then sure go all in on that stock only. Also remember the people who created SARKK have launched another ETF called ARKK leveraged 3x. So maybe if money flows around in it like SARKK then hey Roku gets most of the money since its her top holding. Winner : Google + Roku ( On your own level of risk ) f ) International Since China is about to stimulate its economy and Hong Kong basically is under china control then expect the popular stocks over there to grow as well. Includes : BABA, JD, Tencent Winner : BABA, Bytedance ( If it goes public ) Reason : Amazon and Target money will flow here. Also the low PE / PEG ratio is highly attractive. And hey Munger is buying alongside Blackrock and Bridgwater. Remember we chose Nio too. So keep them at 20% and divide yourselves. Note : The winner decision is solely according to me. Also i haven't given the price levels to buy. That is upto you guys to decide. This is not a Financial advise. As for the proof that i am buying here are my positions on some of the things that i went shopping around. Tesla + TMF The amount has not yet been credited yet. Result : It shall be knows until 2024-2025. Conclusion : Fuck i don't know if it will work. But hey if a monkey can beat the stock market so can this monkey too. P.s. I was quite heartbroken on Sunday so i was unable to write anything. Had to drink so much that this time that i couldn't write anything. Liverpool lost the EPL guys. We came so close. Had the Villa hold on for 20 more minutes what a script it would have been. Felt bad for that goalie though and Gerrard. Imagine slipping twice. Next week we kick Real ass in UCL.

,"Respected Traders & Investors, I know folks, it's hard. Just hang on for a few more weeks. Okay!!! A fake exit liquidity rally like March FOMC is just around the corner. So please bear with me. I know times are tough, but guys, we have gotta dig deep and stick around. Until then let's have some fun creating a portfolio. A BS story from my dreams. Might as well skip it. ( Especially Tl;Dr folks ) Story about an island doom. Before we begin creating our portfolio, let me tell you all a story. It goes like there was an island in the middle of a huge ocean where everybody was having a blast. Rich people bought their yachts and the common folks brought their gondola boats. Everyday, the rich and common people used to boat around from the island shore to the middle of the ocean for food. The rich guys used their expensive equipment while the common folks used the traditional method of net for hunt. After everyone was done with their hunting, they used to head back to the island. As the night came down, the rich folks partied on their yachts, while the common folks used to party on the island itself and hence sleep in the stone cave passed by generations. As the days continued by, the people now had to go a little further from the day before because they weren't a lot of things left to hunt in the regions they used to before. As they were going far into the ocean, people started seeing many whales emerging from beneath the ocean. They looked kinda sick because they weren't moving a lot. No one knew the reason why they were slowly dying. Some folks saw this as a warning sign so they took off back to their island. But the rich folks didn't care, and so did some common folks. As the day passed by sharks started appearing in one's, two's and three's, and so on. With passing of each day there were more sharks than the previous one. They used to come for those whales and then leave. Slowly, all the whales disappeared, and hence the sharks too. Everyone thought it was all back to normal, so they continued with their hunting. But then came that fateful day when a swarm of sharks, which looked so hungry, started attacking the people in boats. Heck, there were some big hungry sharks that they even attacked the rick folks yacht. So both the common and rich folks tried to boat around back to the island for safety, but they had come so far off this time around. The yachts, though, were fast so they came back quickly, but the gondola boats were slow. Only the few lucky ones survived. It was all silence on the island. Everyone was quite afraid to head back to the far off water. Days past by and slowly we could see the water in the ocean started disappearing. Everybody was in amazement, like they saw some kind of magic, but some folks knew this was just the beginning of the bad days that were about to come. As months passed, the people started becoming angry because they now had to look for food in the jungle which wasn't quite tasteful compared to seafood. The rich folks used to come visit the island jungle, too, and take whatever they pleased.. At first people let it be because they thought the resources of the jungle were in plenty. But slowly, as time passed by they too became scarce. Now people from both sides were really getting angry. Riots started breaking out around b/w rich and common folks. The people started fighting against each other. The situation got so bad that rich folks started burning the places of ordinary folks. To which people replied back by throwing rocks at the yachts. As the years passed by, only the few survived to live the tale and were able to live off of the island's scare resources. As time progressed the water in the ocean started coming back and so were resources of the island that got depleted, replenished as more folks started going around for the hunt. And hence the cycle repeated itself again for 10 or more yrs. Moral of the story : I leave it to you people to decide in the comments section. Also, the last paragraph is kinda my interpretation of what happened. I leave that up to you. Hey, maybe no one survived to live the tale. Streak of losses Recap : 16th May - 20th May The last week was pretty crazy. S&P 500 finally entered its bear market and dropped to almost -22%. whereas the Nasdaq declined about -30% making this market performance as the worst since 1931 ""Great depression"". We also had 7 straight weeks of red which is just behind the March 2001 ""Dotcom crash"" and May 1970 ""Stagflation"". Apple warning : Later i said if Apple looks bad so will Tesla. Because both are cash Hedge. As my viewers already know we talked about Apple and Tesla warning in my last post where i was worried about their charts. So it indeed happened. Apple dropped below its 100 week MA and Tesla got hammered with FUD articles. Elon Musk thinks its a ploy by democrats.. What do y'all think. Tell me about in the comments section. By the way guys I see no one in Wall street bets talk about things before 1987. Why is that ? Everyone just wants to either compare things with recent recession of 2008 or they want the 1987 ""Black Monday"" crash where DOW dropped -20% in a day. I think people are really getting tired of this constant velocity crash with no acceleration to the downside. Some Economists thinks Powell should just rug-pull and kill the economy in a day. Why to wait for 6 months when things can be done in a day. Pretty shitty argument in my opinion cause why would you want to pressure economy in just a single day. Also some other Economists are calling for retail capitulation. I have no idea guys. It could come or not come before June or July FOMC. But it sure is heck is coming in Q4. ( It will be marked by capitulation in retail stocks, ) Hedge funds top Investments I was very lucky last week to have time and watch ""Jeremy Grantham"" and ""Ray Dalio"" my two favorite logical investors together for an online video conference where they talked about their views on economy. Both of them have a pretty different outlook for the future. Ray believes the changing world order is about to happen in this cycle where the China and rest other emerging markets from Asia such as India will boom as compared to USA where we could have a bust. (But his fund has an allocation to FTSE 100. Interesting) Jeremy believes we are in for a dotcom style crash. But both of them don't believe in the idea of recession this year but yeah the risk of stagflation are increasing day by day according to them. Growth in their opinion though will be slowing in the upcoming years. Also do watch ""All in podcast"" show. In latest episode we have a guy who predicted 5 out of the last 3 recessions and invested in We work.ðŸ˜‚ Okay moving on lets summarize key highlights of this week from CNBC television : Jet blue hostile bid for spirit airlines. Boeing is shit. Elon twitter drama. Oil to $150 after china deal. Warren Buffet buying energy and increasing stake in occidental petroleum. Healthcare and energy can be defensive and aggressive play for portfolio managers this year. Netflix upgraded by a bear. Walmart & Target earnings disaster. Retail sales 0.9% est 1% in April. Job cuts in Netflix and HOOD. Hiring freeze in Facebook & COIN. Fin-tech bottom is in according to analysts. Google is good in economic slowdown. Growth scare. Long term bond buying and equities falling regardless. The White House is now looking to cut corporate greed. Looks like no more price gouging. The unhedged hedge fund Melvin capital is shutting down. You guys did it. David won against Goliath. Identify the difference b/w short covering and bear market rally. Biden meets leaders of Sweden, Finland. Meaning they are going to join NATO this year. We have Monkey pox to deal with. Twitter says it's the courtesy of Bill Gates. Auto loan delinquencies hits highest since 2007. Sam Bank-man Fried bought Robinhood. FTX is about to start stock trading. Meaning if CBDC's by government arrives then petro dollar becomes hetero dollar of trading worldwide. Where we stand Now since many of you guys are new here. Let me bore you once again. We will eventually go into b/w of forgotten depression of 1921 and full blown depression. Depression is just a longer lasting recession. Recession in my opinion will happen later in Q4 because I don't think coming GDP print will be -ve but i think next one and the next one in January will be. Hence i always say when Dow jones hits anywhere b/w 50 MMA - 200 MMA just start DCAing in index ( picking stocks is hard ) like SPX, Nasdaq, DJI. Or if you really wanna buy stocks then go ahead pick the best stocks and DCA ( no one knows the true bottom ) that will last 10yrs. And have patience and conviction. Also we have short term swing trade in indices coming up. We could do this by DCAing index in before June or July FOMC and then sell in before September arrives. You could play options or specific stocks but i wont help you with which ones. I prefer index. Charts of the week Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 1 : The 10yr breakevens on the chart are first thing that tops. It tells investors inflation problem is about to happen. Then it's the inflation that starts rising. Now depending upon the inflation level the bond yields rise. More the inflation more the Fed becomes hawkish. Hence at the end its the interest rate that tops. So in a sense 10yr breakevens are the leading indicator for inflation level. Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 2 : The 40 year cycle. We already know that the stock market revolves around a cycle. The 1940 - 1980 cycle in which the bond yields made higher high's and higher low's. And then the 1980 - 2020 cycle where bond yields made a lower high's and lower low's. During the first 40 cycle the interest rate peaked before the bond yields and were more higher in number. In the next 40 cycle the interest rate peaked after the bond yields and were much lower. The Boom Bust cycles XD Observation 3 : ( Don't laugh) So everyone knows how a economy works. I have taken a segment from a way longer cycle of economics passed from generations. ( The 90yr cycle ) We have a period of boom and then we have a period of bust. The boom period from 1980-2020 is over in my opinion where the talk was about globalization Chart : Dow Jones , Orange line : Bond yields , Blue line : Inflation Observation 4 : Let's find out where in history we could be. So high inflation with low bond yields right. So it could be the 1940's or 1948 when Fed decided to kill inflation by raising rates so high that it caused a deflationary period. Result : I have no idea where are we. This experiment was for nothing or maybe it was. But we pose similarity to all of the periods. Disease | Russia wise : 1921 Forgotten depression Chart wise and cycle wise : 1929 depression. Rate, Inflation and bond wise : 1940's. News event wise : 1970's stagflation. Technology and funding wise : 2000 dotcom bubble. WSB wise : 2008 recession.

(But his fund has an allocation to FTSE 100. Interesting) Jeremy believes we are in for a dotcom style crash. But both of them don't believe in the idea of recession this year but yeah the risk of stagflation are increasing day by day according to them. Growth in their opinion though will be slowing in the upcoming years. Also do watch ""All in podcast"" show.

Auto loan delinquencies hits highest since 2007. Sam Bank-man Fried bought Robinhood. FTX is about to start stock trading. Meaning if CBDC's by government arrives then petro dollar becomes hetero dollar of trading worldwide. Where we stand Now since many of you guys are new here. Let me bore you once again. We will eventually go into b/w of forgotten depression of 1921 and full blown depression. Depression is just a longer lasting recession. Recession in my opinion will happen later in Q4 because I don't think coming GDP print will be -ve but i think next one and the next one in January will be. Hence i always say when Dow jones hits anywhere b/w 50 MMA - 200 MMA just start DCAing in index ( picking stocks is hard ) like SPX, Nasdaq, DJI. Or if you really wanna buy stocks then go ahead pick the best stocks and DCA ( no one knows the true bottom ) that will last 10yrs. And have patience and conviction. Also we have short term swing trade in indices coming up. We could do this by DCAing index in before June or July FOMC and then sell in before September arrives. You could play options or specific stocks but i wont help you with which ones. I prefer index. Charts of the week Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 1 : The 10yr breakevens on the chart are first thing that tops. It tells investors inflation problem is about to happen. Then it's the inflation that starts rising. Now depending upon the inflation level the bond yields rise. More the inflation more the Fed becomes hawkish. Hence at the end its the interest rate that tops. So in a sense 10yr breakevens are the leading indicator for inflation level. Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate Observation 2 : The 40 year cycle. We already know that the stock market revolves around a cycle. The 1940 - 1980 cycle in which the bond yields made higher high's and higher low's. And then the 1980 - 2020 cycle where bond yields made a lower high's and lower low's. During the first 40 cycle the interest rate peaked before the bond yields and were more higher in number. In the next 40 cycle the interest rate peaked after the bond yields and were much lower. The Boom Bust cycles XD Observation 3 : ( Don't laugh) So everyone knows how a economy works. I have taken a segment from a way longer cycle of economics passed from generations. ( The 90yr cycle ) We have a period of boom and then we have a period of bust. The boom period from 1980-2020 is over in my opinion where the talk was about globalization Chart : Dow Jones , Orange line : Bond yields , Blue line : Inflation Observation 4 : Let's find out where in history we could be. So high inflation with low bond yields right. So it could be the 1940's or 1948 when Fed decided to kill inflation by raising rates so high that it caused a deflationary period. Result : I have no idea where are we. This experiment was for nothing or maybe it was. But we pose similarity to all of the periods. Disease | Russia wise : 1921 Forgotten depression Chart wise and cycle wise : 1929 depression. Rate, Inflation and bond wise : 1940's. News event wise : 1970's stagflation. Technology and funding wise : 2000 dotcom bubble. WSB wise : 2008 recession. Welcome to the Jungle : Its time for our portfolio building Look guys before we begin let me tell you i am not an expert of fundamental analyzing the companies. But what i am good at is knowing the narratives beforehand and combining it with my technical analysis on stock market where it is headed. But yah of course i do watch earnings and this week is gonna be awesome. Let us begin this unique way of investing. This week : Earnings + FOMC minutes. Hypothesis : If stock valuation relative to others becomes cheap then the algorithms created by big institutions and Hedge funds will buy the stock and sell it quickly or hold according to their analysts or portfolio manger if they are interesting on betting the stock for next cycle. We are going to construct the most knowable portfolio passed down by the generations before. It's called a 60-40% portfolio. But we are gonna make few adjustments to it. Equities : 60% -> 40% USA + 20% international Bonds : 40% -> 30% bonds + 10% metals. We don't take commodities because they are for trading purposes mostly. Step 1 : 10% metals Gold Silver Since we are in 1921, 1929, 1940, 1970, 2000 or 2008. what we know is gold parabolic move is sure to happen. But what we don't know is when to buy gold. We all know in financial crisis gold will fall too or when Powell goes for aggressive rate hike. But it wont capitulate like equities because gold moves slow. It's only in the parabolic moves that gold moves fast. But there are factors that causes it. So the narrative around it will surely come by 2025. Meaning. We buy some now and some portion in crisis. We will add silver too because it will move a lot if Gold goes parabolic.Kinda like how large cap help move small caps. Result : $6 Gold ( $3 right now + $3 in crisis ) + $4 Silver ( $2 right now + $2 in crisis ) Step 2 : 30% bonds. Now this thing is kinda hard to predict and is a matter of preference because there are many types of bonds available. What i will be doing is outperforming those other corporate bonds which gives high return but there are risk associated with it. This chart tell us low yield bonds are about to be bought as compared to high yield risk bonds So I picked TMF for this because i'm chasing high returns with no risk at all. Yes sure its a leveraged ETF but from this chart i know in coming few months most investors will be flocking to longer yield bonds because the growth scare hasn't yet been priced in. Hence the TMF bond will peak because of max euphoria at the end of Q4. My projection are already given in the charts. The only risk to it is change in terminal rates (3.2% aug 2023) or changing the definition of neutral.( 2-3%) TMF ( No income ) = 3 x TLT ( It gives fixed income quarterly ) Result : $15 right now in TMF + $15 ( wait for june TLT ) Step 3 : 60% Equities. Next 60% will be to equities. For this i will picking winner stock with 2025 max profits guarantees. It is up to you guys to decide which winner stock and how much should be in portfolio. And at what price levels are you comfortable with. a) Voldemort class ( These class of stocks are linked to the asset class i cannot name here because i will get banned. But hey we can name the stocks ) Includes : MTTR, MSTR, COIN, HOOD, HUT8, COIN, Winner : MTTR, COIN Reason : MSTR is bound to get liquidated since saylor is known for crisis like dotcom. HOOD c'mon guys we all hate it. Also Vlad is such a shit CEO. If he gets removed as CEO and Sam Bank man like Elon makes a play for position then heck yes. It could be proxy to investing with FTX. HUT8 hmm. I just don't like mining stocks. Matterport on the other hand has got metaverse play in it. So im expecting it to do a 8x by then and everybody loves Brian. Heck even the SEC too. He's got good leadership skills and would do anything for the company. $40 was such a good deal. Man i missed it. It was trading below its funding valuation and 2x the money they had. b) EV play. Includes : Rivian, Ford, GM, Tesla, Nio, Lucid Winner : Tesla, Nio Reason : I'm going calling the dibs on Tesla even though its price can fall to $380. Coz why won't you wanna have Tesla in your portfolio. Its still got India play left inside it. Yes supply chain are the problems but i believe this company will get help from china. Hence Nio too. So allocate some to Tesla and Nio. Nio because George Soros who broke bank of England is buying heavy. So Hf's or institutions would not even possibly think of shorting this stock. Such is the fear of Soros in Wallstreet. c) Gaming play + Chips Includes : AMD, Intel, Nvidia Winner : Nvidia ( Little partial ) Reason : I am partial to this even though AMD has started producing cheaper and better products and aren't suffering in supply chain as much. Nvidia in my opinion is world class and its products last longer than other products. Also there is a heavy demand by consumers. Nothing will ever change that. It's kinda like Apple of the space. Also its the leading in ml + ai too. I believe Tesla and Nvidia will partner in future. I could be wrong here and hey maybe AMD kicks its butt but i'm gonna go Nvidia. Also AMD has to fight some FUD articles in the future. Its up to you guys to decide. But i sure as hell don't want you to buy intel. d ) Payment play Includes : VISA, Master card, PayPal Winner : Paypal Reason :They are doing so much in Voldomort asset class. VISA wtf are you doing though by joking around with that sh9t. e ) The others Rest guys i believe in peace so no Palantir for me. And since Jamie Dimon is leaving i think JP Morgan will fall. If he stick around till 2025 then i sure as hell would keep this in my portfolio. Also i don't want Ecom in portfolio ( AMZN + Target + Walmart ) but i sure as hell want Google. Its got that growth in slowing economy factor for me. Because who forgets to search on google and play videos on Youtube. And then there is Cathie wood and her Roku. Look guys if she is doing an insider trading and knows something about the company that we don't then sure go all in on that stock only. Also remember the people who created SARKK have launched another ETF called ARKK leveraged 3x. So maybe if money flows around in it like SARKK then hey Roku gets most of the money since its her top holding. Winner : Google + Roku ( On your own level of risk ) f ) International Since China is about to stimulate its economy and Hong Kong basically is under china control then expect the popular stocks over there to grow as well. Includes : BABA, JD, Tencent Winner : BABA, Bytedance ( If it goes public ) Reason : Amazon and Target money will flow here. Also the low PE / PEG ratio is highly attractive. And hey Munger is buying alongside Blackrock and Bridgwater. Remember we chose Nio too. So keep them at 20% and divide yourselves. Note : The winner decision is solely according to me. Also i haven't given the price levels to buy. That is upto you guys to decide. This is not a Financial advise. As for the proof that i am buying here are my positions on some of the things that i went shopping around. Tesla + TMF The amount has not yet been credited yet. Result : It shall be knows until 2024-2025. Conclusion : Fuck i don't know if it will work. But hey if a monkey can beat the stock market so can this monkey too. P.s. I was quite heartbroken on Sunday so i was unable to write anything. Had to drink so much that this time that i couldn't write anything. Liverpool lost the EPL guys. We came so close. Had the Villa hold on for 20 more minutes what a script it would have been. Felt bad for that goalie though and Gerrard. Imagine slipping twice. Next week we kick Real ass in UCL.
