,"As I understand, credit card debt is at or near ATH in the US - are V and MA exposed to a risk of increased default rates? My understanding is that the card issuers are at risk, not the processors, but I am not sure if this is the case.","No. They facilitate transactions between banks and merchants. They’re middle men. The only exception would be American Express doing both.When you open a credit card, it’s a revolving line of credit through a bank. The bank sends you a card through Visa or MasterCard. Visa and MasterCard simply facilitate the transaction. When you use your card, the bank pays the store or merchant with Visa/MasterCard. You then owe the bank that money.If you can’t pay, it’s the banks problem.",0,0.517,NEGATIVE,0.988

My understanding is that the card issuers are at risk, not the processors, but I am not sure if this is the case.","I mean yes, but credit card companies generally make their money two ways. A fee per transaction and/or a percentage of the purchase.So while yes people defaulting is a concern, the bigger concern by cc companies is overall spending in the economy.Also even if a person defaults their one card, they probably have several other Visa and MasterCard’s through other banks/credit cards which they will use instead.Even debit cards mostly use Visa and MasterCard.",2,0.524,NEGATIVE,0.997

Most ATM cards have a V/MC logo on it and they will still get a cut both through the issuing bank as well as the operator of the ATM.
