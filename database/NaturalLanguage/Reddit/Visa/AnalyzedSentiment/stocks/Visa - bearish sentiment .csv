,"I was pretty surprised to see Visa receive a bearish sentiment from Refintiv / StarMine. I know that this is just one organization’s opinion but Zacks also moved them from “buy” to “hold”. Very odd given the increased amount of spending and inflation. Strangely inflation helps the Visa/MasterCard/AMEX of the worst because they make that much more on transactional fees. Visa also has one of, if not the best 10year month over month chart of any of the top 100 stocks. Is anyone else surprised by this? Maybe I’m missing something?",Ima take a look at the chart in a sec after i hit this dab,0,0.501,0.989,POSITIVE

It looks like Visa is seeing alot of volume ... Personally, I tend to bet on reversals and not momentum, so I would be biased that this chart is going to pullback before it continues climbing, but the RSI would indicate it shouldn't sell off too much if it does ... if it sold to 221 and failed, I would expect it to fall to 205 and if it broke that then 190 and then 185 looks like it was tested alot ... but I really doubt that would happen tbh. This is a very strong chart and its growth is steady over years. No recent parabolic gap up or anything. Id say be prepared to potentially see $210, but honeslty im bullish on $V.Not much I can say on $PSY it appears to have only been trading for a few days? Extremely low volume, however. Not much context to work with here unfortunetly.Mod deleted my comment bc I accidently misspelled b- u - t",2,0.52,0.717,NEGATIVE

The only thing that really matters is how much money they make and currently the amount they make is not enough to justify their share price.",0,0.518,1.0,NEGATIVE
