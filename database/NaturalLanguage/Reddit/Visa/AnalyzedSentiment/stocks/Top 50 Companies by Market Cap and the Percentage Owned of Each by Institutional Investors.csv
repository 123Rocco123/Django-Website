,"Not sure if this is helpful at all or if anyone cares, but since has been all the rage for the past ~14 months and has recently been included in the S&P 500, I checked to see what % of it was held by institutional investors, and how that compares with the other 49 of the largest companies by market cap in the world. Some findings: 39.77% of Tesla is held by institutional investors. This places it #43 out of 50, and #42 out of 44 out of American companies. The only American companies on the top 50 with a lower percentage of itself owned by institutional investors are Wal-Mart and Berkshire Hathaway Class A shares. The overall average is 61.57%. For the United States, it's slightly higher at 67.36%, and for international companies, of which there are only 7, the average is much lower at 19.16%. The lowest is Toyota, with only 1.11% owned by institutional investors. The highest is Visa, with 92.76%.

Kind of hoping someone will weigh in.There's a lot of talk that institutional investors drive or at least prop up stock prices since they have to match commonly tracked indices to offer them as investment options for their clients. This mandates they buy shares. At the same time, they're purely reactive. Companies tracking the S&P 500 had to buy a bunch of Tesla shares after it got added so their S&P 500 index funds can accurately track the index's growth. From what I understand this shouldn't impact too much since they're not really responsible for day-by-day trading volume.There could be other implications. Maybe institutional investors aren't confident in the stock's future and don't want to get caught holding the bag. Maybe they still haven't bought enough of the stock yet for their indexes, though I can't imagine why they haven't by now. Maybe there are other reasons. As American companies go, only WMT is lower on the list and I don't think anyone thinks it's a dogshit stock, even if its growth could be limited based on a number of arguments.Sorry I can't give you much more info than that. Maybe someone will come along who can.",1,0.538,1.0,NEGATIVE

I’d be curious to see how Tesla’s institutional ownership percentage has changed over this year.It’s sort of shocking it’s been so divergent from the S&P thus far, normally that gives MMs a nice place to hedge options which keeps them from getting squeezed but it seems to be having no effect right now.",1,0.521,0.776,POSITIVE
