,"So I started investing 2.5 years ago. I have 25% in AAPL, NVDA, 10% each in CRSP, Starbucks, Visa and Nintendo. I speculate with 5% and keep 5% as cash. TDA,as far as I know, doesn't do partial shares outside of DRIP and all of my stocks are getting kind of expensive to add to my position.",The AAPL and NVDA splits helped out a ton with that did they not? All of those are <$300 so just wait until you have the money to add to one. Or you can move your money to an account that does fractional shares,0,0.516,1.0,NEGATIVE

TDA,as far as I know, doesn't do partial shares outside of DRIP and all of my stocks are getting kind of expensive to add to my position.",Yes the splits definitely helped. I guess I remember when CRSP and starbucks were less than 70 dollars so maybe that's making me hesitant at these prices. Thank you for your encouragement I will just have to buy one share at a time if I want to add more.,1,0.529,0.993,POSITIVE

I like this idea a lot for a reasonable investment strategy.OP is well position with a handful of individual stocks that he likes. The small portfolio lacks some diversity.

I never made buy/sell orders from ToS anyways, always did it from the TDA website.The other major difference between Fidelity and TDA is that in premarket and afterhours, TDA will keep updating your stocks with the PM and AH prices where Fidelity only updates during market open hours. Most of my positions are long term so it wasn't that big of a deal for me.EDIT: I kept like $500 in my TDA account specifically so I wouldn't lose access to ThinkorSwim",4,0.53,1.0,NEGATIVE

If you end up switching to Fidelity, let me know how you like it.BTW, buying/selling thru the TDA site is pretty nice. There's a ""snap ticket"" that pops up from the bottom of the screen with a ""quote"" button that you can hit with your ticker symbol and as long as you have the Price Column ""unlocked"" (see picture), it will update automatically as the price changes.
