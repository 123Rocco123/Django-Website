This came in higher than the 108.0 consensus economists were looking for, according to Bloomberg data. It also marked the first monthly increase in confidence since June. Lynn Franco, Senior Director of Economic Indicators at the Conference Board, said “Consumer confidence improved in October, reversing a three-month downward trend as concerns about the spread of the Delta variant eased. The proportion of consumers planning to purchase homes, automobiles, and major appliances all increased in October—a sign that consumer spending will continue to support economic growth through the final months of 2021.""
