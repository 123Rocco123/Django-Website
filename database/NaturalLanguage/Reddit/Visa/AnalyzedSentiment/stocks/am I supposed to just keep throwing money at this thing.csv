,"I began investing small amounts (but big amounts for me) for the first time in my life last June. I was told this was a fantastic time to get into investing because the market was down and so becomes a buyers market, ofcourse everybody knows the story that other than a week long rally here and there its been a bloodbath since I started investing and it is showing no signs of slowing down. Its easy to just say I picked bad stocks etc etc but I've got a 7k in a mix of things like VOO, Berkshire Hathway, Shell, Amazon, Visa, a small amount of crypto etc etc basically mainly 'blue chip' type investments, though I'm in the red on all of them on virtually all positions. Warren Buffett and many others say keep investing heavily as the market goes down but hell is this wise for me to keep throwing money I can't afford to lose completely and watching it go down 25% in the space of a month knowing in the comfort that in 10 years down the same position will go back into green? I know no individual stocks can be guaranteed to do this but the market as a whole is this literally how it works? Other People say invest in bonds for the time being and sit it out as bonds out perform stocks in the short term in these sort of markets, but long term am I not better up loading on stocks as the price goes down as the long term this will be the better option? I'm not really looking for a shoulder to cry on for sombody to tell me it will be all ok but getting into the market not far into what some are saying is the longest bear market for decades seems like I've committed financial suicide but others suggest I've gotten in at the perfect moment when thinking long term? EDIT: Thanks for the replies, just to clarify when I say I can't afford to lose the money I mean in the sense can anyone afford to lose their savings? My bills get paid every month etc this is savings and money left over each month I'm currently investing.","Look at it this way.seems like I've committed financial suicide but others suggest I've gotten in at the perfect moment when thinking long term?If you aren't planning on selling any of your investments for about 10 years or so, yes. Keep on adding. It has to get bad before it gets good.Timing the market is borderline impossible, keep adding, do not even check your portfolio.Eventually, it may not be this year, but eventually, I'd assume most of your holdings will rebound.The main problem is, at the moment, there's a lot of fear in the markets. People are worried about bank collapsing, inflation, stagnation, energy prices, food and more (depending on location), so until the fears subside, the market will go down.Don't try and time it, just set up an auto-buy, or lower your DCA amount, as long as you're NOT putting in more than you can afford to lose, you'll be fine in the long term. Not next week, or by May. LONG term. Think years ahead.",0,0.538,1.0,NEGATIVE

If you fancy yourself passive, that job is fairly simple. If you fancy yourself a gambler, that's a lot of TA, etc. etc. If you fancy yourself an long term investor, read Aswath Damodaran's work and watch his YouTube content.The idea of invested capital, is that it's your excess capital. What else would you do with the excess capital? You'd blow it, so at least you can risk it on an investment to grow into your future.And maybe it never does grow, but again, what else are you going to do with the capital?You shouldn't put up the down payment for something you need, it shouldn't be your emergency funds, your bill money, etc. What you invest should be money that if you did not invest, all it would do would sit there needlessly and have time erode it, and/or get wasted.Your decisions can not be made by another person. It's your money to profit or loose over the duration of your bet. You need to know why you're willing to risk it, and how you're willing to risk it. If you're doing anything beyond a passive bet on positive drift, get ready to make financial literacy and self directing your education towards that your life, at least for the next couple years.",0,0.519,0.999,NEGATIVE

I'm not really looking for a shoulder to cry on for sombody to tell me it will be all ok but getting into the market not far into what some are saying is the longest bear market for decades seems like I've committed financial suicide but others suggest I've gotten in at the perfect moment when thinking long term?

,"I began investing small amounts (but big amounts for me) for the first time in my life last June. I was told this was a fantastic time to get into investing because the market was down and so becomes a buyers market, ofcourse everybody knows the story that other than a week long rally here and there its been a bloodbath since I started investing and it is showing no signs of slowing down. Its easy to just say I picked bad stocks etc etc but I've got a 7k in a mix of things like VOO, Berkshire Hathway, Shell, Amazon, Visa, a small amount of crypto etc etc basically mainly 'blue chip' type investments, though I'm in the red on all of them on virtually all positions. Warren Buffett and many others say keep investing heavily as the market goes down but hell is this wise for me to keep throwing money I can't afford to lose completely and watching it go down 25% in the space of a month knowing in the comfort that in 10 years down the same position will go back into green?

This advice is obviously not for risky investments, but in your case, you chose good, stable picks. They’re bound to go back up.",0,0.513,0.988,NEGATIVE

The more you know about your stocks or investing in general the less anxious you’ll be during sell offs. Reccomend listening to some podcasts or maybe read a book like the millionaire next door or the simple path to wealth. Rich dad, poor dad is another good and easy read. None of those books are really going to teach you how to value a stock but they’ll get you to think more like an investor and psychology is a huge part of this game.",0,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE
