,"Amazon and Visa appear to have agreed an 11th-hour resolution to their bitter dispute after the online retailer told customers they can continue using Visa credit cards on the site. On Monday morning, Amazon started sending affected customers emails telling them they would be able to continue to use their Visa credit cards to pay for items, and for Amazon Prime. “The expected change regarding the use of Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk will no longer take place on 19 January. We are working closely with Visa on a potential solution that will enable customers to continue using their Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk,” the email stated. “Should we make any changes related to Visa credit cards, we will give you advance notice. Until then, you can continue to use Visa credit cards, debit cards, Mastercard, American Express, and Eurocard as you do today.” Almost 90% of Britons shop at Amazon, and its analysts have estimated Amazon Prime membership in the UK to be about 21 million. Last month, it was claimed that Amazon faced losing nearly £1.4bn from UK shoppers had Visa credit cards been banned from the site. A Visa spokesperson said: “Amazon customers can continue to use Visa cards on Amazon.co.uk after January 19 while we work closely together to reach an agreement.” https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/17/amazon-and-visa-end-game-of-corporate-chicken-over-uk-credit-cards",I kinda expected this would happen given that both Visa and Amazon would benefit from an agreement. This is probably good news for both AMZN and V.,0,0.542,0.944,NEGATIVE

The use of Visa cards in the UK on Amazon is mostly immaterial for both parties. It was an opening shot in the war between commerce platforms and payment processors.If Visa relented and reduced fees for Amazon, then what’s stopping Amazon from waiting a few quarters and then squeezing a little harder? Bigger markets like the US? What about Apple, Google, ect.?With the development of decentralized payment solutions slowly chugging along, traditional rails have even less long term leverage,Unless we get information that Amazon backed off without any concessions, I can’t see how this saga is positive for Visa, Mastercard, and Amex going forward.",1,0.519,0.968,NEGATIVE
