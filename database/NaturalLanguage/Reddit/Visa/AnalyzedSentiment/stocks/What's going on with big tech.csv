,"What's up with big tech the last few months or so? I feel like most of the big tech companies, with some exception to Apple, have been super stagnant. Microsoft, Visa, Amazon have all been floating within the same price range and have barely moved. Is it because of the concern of anti trust laws? Small caps in tech have moved significantly in that same time frame.","Welcome to r/stocks!For beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our Wiki here.If you're wondering why a stock moved a certain way, check out Finviz which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see Reuters, and even Yahoo Finance.Please direct all simple questions towards the stickied Daily Discussion and Quarterly Rate My Portfolio threads (sort by Hot, they're at the top).Also include some due diligence to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

These stocks have been hitting ATHs and then consolidating below them before hitting more ATHs. Just buy and hold, IMO. The Apples, Amazons, and Microsofts of the world are big bad money making machines.",0,0.536,1.0,NEGATIVE

I think they’re fairly valued, and I appreciate the relatively ‘stagnant’ prices—they’re solid and consistent.

Even then 2021 going forward should be better for them with more shift away from cash.MSFT & AMZN had fantastic run ups in the past year, a consolidation period is good for them.",0,0.566,0.852,POSITIVE
