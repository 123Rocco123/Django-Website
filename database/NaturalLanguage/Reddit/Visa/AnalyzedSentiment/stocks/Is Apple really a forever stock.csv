Charlie Munger once gave an interview where he said that companies are like organisms. They all eventually die. Some die sooner than others. So the question isn't really whether it is ""forever"" but rather when it will die. And the answer is well... I don't know... but it certainly isn't going to die anytime soon. And it may not even die in our lifetime. But I have no idea how to forecast 50+ years into the future so I'm not even going to try.",0,0.543,0.977,NEGATIVE

It may not look the same in 300/500/1,000+ years, but as long as there are still people, there will still be a Disney.Is it the same for Apple? Most likely, in some capacity. It may eventually go private or get bought out & become a subsidiary of someone else, but I doubt the human race will ever again see a world without Apple.",1,0.543,0.998,NEGATIVE

Not everyone can afford a $1,100 phone, which is why Apple phone sales have started to die off. Apple was sort of like Tesla for the first 3-5 years the iPhone was out, nobody had anything even close to it on the market. By the time everyone else caught up Apple was ""the"" phone brand to buy, and they got millions of people hooked on their ecosystem using the iPhone during that period. I think Apple was smart to start Apple TV; they have to do SOMETHING to expand their business elsewhere. The big problem Apple has though is that technology has gotten much cheaper in the past decade. You can buy a high end laptop for a fraction of what an Apple laptop costs and you get close to the same performance. Apple has always been able to charge a super high premium for their products, but that's going to be more and more difficult going forward. All this to say, yes Apple will be around for a long long time because they have a cult like following with their customers, but they better come up with some new innovation soon (maybe their own smart car) or they are not going to be the mammoth they have been in another 5-10 years.",0,0.542,0.999,NEGATIVE

Sell when near 52 week peak and buy on dip, rinse and repeat.BTW Apple is not only on iphones, they have other ecosystem too (Apple TV, Apple Music, new M1 chips, Apple store, the current hype is Apple Car but I prefer an autonomous airborne Apple Taxi within 30 years).",2,0.535,0.997,POSITIVE

They have cash enough to be ahead in the next disruption of the market in many ways. Is also true that the allure of Steve Jobs is gone and maybe Elon Musk has that wand on the hands right now, but Apple knows the markets and they have built a reputation of high standard that millions of users are going to keep in consideration everytime that have to buy. Last but not least, the upcoming stimulus check could serve well to renovate electronic devices and Apple in that sense is in a fantastic position.",0,0.536,0.536,NEGATIVE

Apple could also license this chip to other companies, or branch out and create more ""smart"" devices that are more deeply integrated than any other ecosystem since they'd be built on the same software and hardware by the same company.Apple's M1 chips will be rolled out to all of their devices in the future unifying and solidifying (more) their OS and Mobile platforms providing an even more seamless experience across all the screens a user stares at.They're devices and services ecosystem is an incredible convenience and puts ""cool"" tech into the hands of a lot of people with money who could care less about all the reasons people don't like Apple. To this effect, Apple creates lifetime brand users who have no interest in moving to a different platform.Apple's changing their privacy policies, and clamping down more and more, forcing the advertising industry to adjust its patterns to avoid crazy legal problems involving targeting and digital fingerprinting. Google's moving to trading ""groups"" over individual targeting and this means everyone else will need to as well.Epic is suing them over App Store royalties, if they win, this will cost Apple some cash, probably a few billion at least but will cause an influx of new and old App Developers to the platforms looking to capitalize on Apple having to take a reduced cut.I expect them to move off the reliance of AWS and other cloud providers. Depending on how big they go, it could be a competitor, or they could just run Apple's services.I believe Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are all just following same long-term game-plan, just in slightly different ways.",0,0.532,0.766,POSITIVE
