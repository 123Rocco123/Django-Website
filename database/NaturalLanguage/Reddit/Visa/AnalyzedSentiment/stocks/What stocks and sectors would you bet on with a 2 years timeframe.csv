,"Short term the market is unpredictable, and very long term also becomes increasingly difficult to prevede what will happen, because of the cumulative effect of future new events. So what do you think are the best bets today, considering both potential upside and risk, if you hope to see a profit or simply are willing to completely change your portfolio composition within a couple years? I’m long on the aerospace industry, with Boeing, Lockheed, Airbus and Rolls Royce. They have been beaten up because of the pandemic but I assume they will recover nicely within the time. They can be volatile though. Long Visa and MasterCard, as the move to cashless payments is surely a continuing trend. I see a couple risks here. One is disruption by other companies. Consumer facing brands with a large user base, especially Apple Amazon and Google, have already stepped in the field and could eventually try to create their own payment networks. Then there is possible government disruption, with the move to digital currency, that could affect their margins. Getting more speculative, PayPal is tempting because it had such a great run and then a pullback, but seems also a lot more risk, both comparatively overvalued and easier to replace. Travel recovery looks also like a safe bet, Delta United Hilton Marriot are some interesting names, Airbnb even, but I’d be interested in finding good alternatives. E-commerce, Amazon MercadoLibre and Alibaba are at the moment in widely different situations, but on the whole I suspect they will do well in a couple years. MELI is a growth stock, which is toxic these days, but appears it may honestly grow. BABA is undervalued because China, but I’m confident Jack Ma and the government will find a middle ground as they have largely common interests. Still the relations between China and much of the rest of the world are rapidly deteriorating, something I’m very concerned about, but the greatest worry is that the effect could spill well beyond Chinese stocks. Shorting a bunch of EV and Green energy names is a temptation, but handling the volatility would require a huge margin and the risk high. Meh. Admittedly a shorter timeframe, highly speculative bet, PSTH is tempting because of the fame of Ackman, and being back close to the initial offering price. SPACs are fast falling out of favor, yet this one has been widely publicized and could see a nice bump of share price if a merger is announced.

Downside, China may really hurt teslas numbers b/c they may start banning it in more places so the people are forced to buy Chinese made ev's. I'm not worried about all the ev SPACs b/c they won't be able to get their production costs down before Ford, gm, etc start cranking out ev's like its candy, another concern b/c they have a loyal fan base.

If the pull back in the stock is b/c of bad fundamentals w/ a bad CEO stay away. Also, pay attention to market conditions. If rates go up banks, industrial, etc go up & tech goes down b/c it costs more to borrow money for development. If home purchases are up, home builder stocks go up.
