,I am not a U.S. citizen and I have F1 visa. I bought MLP stock (EPD) this year and just notice the tax is different to general stocks. Will it cause any problem to my visa status? I read websites and some of them show it may be a self-employment income. F1 visa can not have any self-employment Thanks. Sorry for my poor English.,I know H-1Bs can buy stocks as it is Passive investment/income but not sure if it is OK for F1s. I am no attorney but there is no SEVIS rule that says F1 visa holder shouldn't invest passively like there is one for off-campus employment,0,0.529,0.984,NEGATIVE

F1 visa holder can also buy stocks. However, I wonder whether it conclude MLP stocks because it consider as a business partner, although it is passive. I think H1-B are the same as this part. Can H1-B buy that?",1,0.549,1.0,NEGATIVE
