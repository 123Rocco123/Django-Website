The EV industry is in hyper growth mode and charging networks are a diversified play on the whole industry.They're signing partnerships out the wazoo.The only real short thesis is you don't believe EV's will take off. That might have been an acceptable position a few years back. But the facts no longer support it. In reality, the facts on the ground are increasingly pointing to a rather quick and violent shift towards EV's.",0,0.522,1.0,NEGATIVE
