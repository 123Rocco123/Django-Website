,"A volatile end to the week, with the DOW falling below 30000, and the markets selling off. There are a few headlines to consider... some say it was hedgefunds selling to cover their losses, others say it was the J&J trials posting results that fell below expectations, and others say we are at the beginning of a complete crash (maybe a correction, but a complete crash is unlikely). Ultimately, for the investor sell-offs can be healthy and can present buying opportunities. Full disclosure, I haven't bought a single share of GME, AMC, BB, or NOK. I have my eyes set on other buying opportunities--opportunities that I think will continue to pay off in the long run. These are stocks where I slightly increased my positions in today and will continue to consider buying next week depending on how the markets play out. Even when you see a buying opportunity, you don't all-in on one given day. You don't know what the next day/week/month will look like. WMT: WMT has had a ~7% dip since hitting 150. WMT has plans to really ramp up its presence in the advertising industry, which, in my opinion, has a lot of potential. WMT has 250M customers on a weekly basis, globally. They are planning to release their consumer data to companies, which would be an incredible source of information for those in the ad industry. To compare, Amazon tallied about 26M transactions per week which is about 182 M per week. WMT has made it clear that it wants to increase its revenue from ads 10+ times within the next 5 years. Apple: INCREDIBLE earnings beat. Can't emphasize that enough. There is so much already publicized about Apple's amazing quarter. Yet, the price has fallen ~8%. It's likely that Apple has more room to grow as Apple has announced that they'd be producing their own chips. Consumers who are looking for a computer upgrade, are likely to hold until Apple's newest technology comes out. Tim Cook is always looking to push Apple's presence and innovation. I'm looking to increase my position in Apple. Visa: Another great earnings beat followed by a sell-off. I'm looking at this as a great buying opportunity. This is more of a macro trend play. Visa did well given its boost in consumers shopping online. I can only see a company like Visa doing better as cities begin to open up once the pandemic begins to clear. There's a pent up demand to travel, to be out, to buy into experiences that we haven't been able to do for almost a year now. Visa's fintech plays may not have worked out, but Visa is here to stay. Honorable mentions for a diversified portfolio: FB, SBUX/MCD, BAC/JPM, DIS (when it hit close to 160). Good luck everyone!","I'm just worried about this deep red happening again next week.
