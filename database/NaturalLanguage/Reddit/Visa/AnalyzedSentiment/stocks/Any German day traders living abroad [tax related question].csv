,"Hi guys, I have asked this question on a few forums and subreddits already, but nobody could give me an educated answer. I have somebody here can. I am in the process of filling out the documents for an application for a broker in the US. As part of my application I have to tell the broker where I am going to pay taxes. Once I properly start day trading, I will talk to a tax professional about this, but I am not really keen on spending so much money before I even have a broker. So maybe some of you are in a similar or even the same situation and could share your knowledge. I am a German citizen, am still registered back in Germany and still have my parents' house registered as my place of residence. I have now been living in South Africa since February on a student visa, have a flat here and am most likely going to stay until July 2021. For some of you the answer might be crystal clear, but I am uncertain if I will have to pay taxes in Germany or South Africa. Thanks for any advice. PS: Getting a South African or German broker is not an option.",Still registered = need to pay taxesErstwohnsitz = steuerpflicht180 days rule as wellYou can only stay a certain amount of days in Germany if you want to be taxed somewhere else.

In how far would the 183 day rule apply though, considering when I will start day trading I will not have stayed in Germany for more than 183 days.",1,0.511,0.529,POSITIVE

Dies bezieht sich aber generell nur auf das Einkommen, das man im Ausland bezieht.""I will read into the DBA between SA and Germany further, but I was just thinking that while I haven't been in Germany in the last 183 days, meaning I should then pay the taxes in South Africa, I am theoretically not really generating the profit in SA. I mean I am living here while daytrading, but still. I guess you know what I mean. What do you think about that?",1,0.509,0.783,NEGATIVE

Will definitely do some more reading, but it seems like taxes in South Africa it is. Considering the new upcoming law in Germany that might make daytrading unprofitable it maybe isn't the worst thing that I will have to pay the higher taxes here :DAnd yeah racism is big here, but there isn't too much racial violence in the inner parts of Cape Town.
