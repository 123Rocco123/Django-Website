PayPal is more of a tech company masquerading as a finance company. They've lost some ground to Square in the last year or two but are still a leader in their industry. Visa's B2B connect incorporates blockchain into their currency transactions business which has added significant value to their company. Overall, I see both PayPal and Visa outperforming the market in the next 3-5 years.",0,0.604,0.952,NEGATIVE
