Microsoft, Amazon, and Google aren't far behind. The purpose of this post is the look at how much more value the top companies have gained in comparison to to the rest of the market. As of market close today, here's the indices: Index Price 52-week range Highs Lows Off highs Off lows S&P 500 $4,358.69 $3,200.05 - $4,393.68 $4,393.68 $3,200.05 -0.80% 36.21% Nasdaq Composite $14,631.95 $10,217.31 - $14,803.68 $14,803.68 $10,217.31 -1.16% 43.21% Dow Jones Industrial Average $34,798.00 $25,992.28 - $35,091.56 $35,091.56 $25,992.28 -0.84% 33.88% Russell 2000 Index $2,234.04 $1,432.57 - $2,360.17 $2,360.17 $1,432.57 -5.34% 55.95% S&P500, NASDAQ, and Dow are about 1% from its highs while the Russell Index is about 5%. All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&P500? In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows). Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $4.96T $6.49T $7.93T $10.76T $14.15T $18.03T % 23.69% 31.02% 37.87% 51.42% 67.62% 86.14% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $2.9T $780.77B $340.88B $92.3B $38.79B $13.11B % 13.86% 3.73% 1.63% 0.44% 0.19% 0.06% The total value gained in the S&P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (~86%). As of right now, the S&P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies. Valuations of companies right now Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $9.08T $12.26T $15.67T $21.89T $27.68T $34.86T % 23.05% 31.13% 39.8% 55.59% 70.29% 88.51% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $4.52T $1.18T $478.81B $159.71B $73.03B $23.64B % 11.49% 3% 1.22% 0.41% 0.19% 0.06% Top and Bottom Companies off their highs and lows Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 off the highs -2.56% -12.340% -9.13% -6.86% -6.79% -7.42% off the lows 54.50% 54.221% 48.67% 47.09% 53.02% 54.03% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 off the highs -11.53% -13.56% -14.55% -16.05% -20.23% -19.23% off the lows 65.00% 67.48% 75.81% 67.54% 61.85% 56.65% Top 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated. Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

A 3% move would impact $72 billion dollars in valuation and has a 0.18% impact on the index. Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars. Look at how much of an impact these stocks together make. 1% move 2% move 3% move Top 5 0.23% 0.46% 0.69% Top 10 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Top 20 0.391% 0.78% 1.17% The top 20 companies can make a 1%+ move if they averaged a 3% increase/decrease. So what should I get out of this? The S&P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies. S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.","TLDR: don't pay etf fees, buy and hold aapl & msft",0,0.529,0.988,NEGATIVE

Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $4.96T $6.49T $7.93T $10.76T $14.15T $18.03T % 23.69% 31.02% 37.87% 51.42% 67.62% 86.14% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $2.9T $780.77B $340.88B $92.3B $38.79B $13.11B % 13.86% 3.73% 1.63% 0.44% 0.19% 0.06% The total value gained in the S&P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (~86%). As of right now, the S&P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies. Valuations of companies right now Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $9.08T $12.26T $15.67T $21.89T $27.68T $34.86T % 23.05% 31.13% 39.8% 55.59% 70.29% 88.51% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $4.52T $1.18T $478.81B $159.71B $73.03B $23.64B % 11.49% 3% 1.22% 0.41% 0.19% 0.06% Top and Bottom Companies off their highs and lows Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 off the highs -2.56% -12.340% -9.13% -6.86% -6.79% -7.42% off the lows 54.50% 54.221% 48.67% 47.09% 53.02% 54.03% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 off the highs -11.53% -13.56% -14.55% -16.05% -20.23% -19.23% off the lows 65.00% 67.48% 75.81% 67.54% 61.85% 56.65% Top 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated. Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

A 3% move would impact $72 billion dollars in valuation and has a 0.18% impact on the index. Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars. Look at how much of an impact these stocks together make. 1% move 2% move 3% move Top 5 0.23% 0.46% 0.69% Top 10 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Top 20 0.391% 0.78% 1.17% The top 20 companies can make a 1%+ move if they averaged a 3% increase/decrease. So what should I get out of this? The S&P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies. S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.","This is terrible advice. I don’t know if you know this, but the expense ratio on VTI is .03%. If you have 1 million in VTI, that’s only $300 a year.",1,0.6,1.0,NEGATIVE

So what should I get out of this? The S&P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies. S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful.

Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.",Alright cool.,3,0.5,0.545,NEGATIVE

All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&P500? In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows). Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $4.96T $6.49T $7.93T $10.76T $14.15T $18.03T % 23.69% 31.02% 37.87% 51.42% 67.62% 86.14% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $2.9T $780.77B $340.88B $92.3B $38.79B $13.11B % 13.86% 3.73% 1.63% 0.44% 0.19% 0.06% The total value gained in the S&P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (~86%). As of right now, the S&P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies.

Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated. Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $4.96T $6.49T $7.93T $10.76T $14.15T $18.03T % 23.69% 31.02% 37.87% 51.42% 67.62% 86.14% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $2.9T $780.77B $340.88B $92.3B $38.79B $13.11B % 13.86% 3.73% 1.63% 0.44% 0.19% 0.06% The total value gained in the S&P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (~86%). As of right now, the S&P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies. Valuations of companies right now Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $9.08T $12.26T $15.67T $21.89T $27.68T $34.86T % 23.05% 31.13% 39.8% 55.59% 70.29% 88.51% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $4.52T $1.18T $478.81B $159.71B $73.03B $23.64B % 11.49% 3% 1.22% 0.41% 0.19% 0.06% Top and Bottom Companies off their highs and lows Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 off the highs -2.56% -12.340% -9.13% -6.86% -6.79% -7.42% off the lows 54.50% 54.221% 48.67% 47.09% 53.02% 54.03% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 off the highs -11.53% -13.56% -14.55% -16.05% -20.23% -19.23% off the lows 65.00% 67.48% 75.81% 67.54% 61.85% 56.65% Top 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated. Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

A 3% move would impact $72 billion dollars in valuation and has a 0.18% impact on the index. Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars. Look at how much of an impact these stocks together make. 1% move 2% move 3% move Top 5 0.23% 0.46% 0.69% Top 10 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Top 20 0.391% 0.78% 1.17% The top 20 companies can make a 1%+ move if they averaged a 3% increase/decrease. So what should I get out of this? The S&P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies. S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.","AMZN has been trading sideways for an entire year, what are you waiting for",1,0.609,0.972,NEGATIVE

So what should I get out of this? The S&P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies. S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful.

All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&P500? In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows).

The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (~86%). As of right now, the S&P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane.

Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly.

S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.","Yeah I feel like trying to time a buy-in with these companies is a gamble, they're just so big and reliable, the likelihood of them taking a significant percentage loss is so much lower than them going on a big run up, if you're gonna invest in them you might as well just play the odds and DCA in",2,0.527,0.981,POSITIVE

All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&P500? In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows). Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $4.96T $6.49T $7.93T $10.76T $14.15T $18.03T % 23.69% 31.02% 37.87% 51.42% 67.62% 86.14% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $2.9T $780.77B $340.88B $92.3B $38.79B $13.11B % 13.86% 3.73% 1.63% 0.44% 0.19% 0.06% The total value gained in the S&P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (~86%). As of right now, the S&P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies.

Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated. Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

As of market close today, here's the indices: Index Price 52-week range Highs Lows Off highs Off lows S&P 500 $4,358.69 $3,200.05 - $4,393.68 $4,393.68 $3,200.05 -0.80% 36.21% Nasdaq Composite $14,631.95 $10,217.31 - $14,803.68 $14,803.68 $10,217.31 -1.16% 43.21% Dow Jones Industrial Average $34,798.00 $25,992.28 - $35,091.56 $35,091.56 $25,992.28 -0.84% 33.88% Russell 2000 Index $2,234.04 $1,432.57 - $2,360.17 $2,360.17 $1,432.57 -5.34% 55.95% S&P500, NASDAQ, and Dow are about 1% from its highs while the Russell Index is about 5%. All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&P500? In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows). Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $4.96T $6.49T $7.93T $10.76T $14.15T $18.03T % 23.69% 31.02% 37.87% 51.42% 67.62% 86.14% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $2.9T $780.77B $340.88B $92.3B $38.79B $13.11B % 13.86% 3.73% 1.63% 0.44% 0.19% 0.06% The total value gained in the S&P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (~86%). As of right now, the S&P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies. Valuations of companies right now Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $9.08T $12.26T $15.67T $21.89T $27.68T $34.86T % 23.05% 31.13% 39.8% 55.59% 70.29% 88.51% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $4.52T $1.18T $478.81B $159.71B $73.03B $23.64B % 11.49% 3% 1.22% 0.41% 0.19% 0.06% Top and Bottom Companies off their highs and lows Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 off the highs -2.56% -12.340% -9.13% -6.86% -6.79% -7.42% off the lows 54.50% 54.221% 48.67% 47.09% 53.02% 54.03% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 off the highs -11.53% -13.56% -14.55% -16.05% -20.23% -19.23% off the lows 65.00% 67.48% 75.81% 67.54% 61.85% 56.65% Top 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated. Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

A 3% move would impact $72 billion dollars in valuation and has a 0.18% impact on the index. Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars. Look at how much of an impact these stocks together make. 1% move 2% move 3% move Top 5 0.23% 0.46% 0.69% Top 10 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Top 20 0.391% 0.78% 1.17% The top 20 companies can make a 1%+ move if they averaged a 3% increase/decrease. So what should I get out of this? The S&P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies. S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful.

Valuations of companies right now Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $9.08T $12.26T $15.67T $21.89T $27.68T $34.86T % 23.05% 31.13% 39.8% 55.59% 70.29% 88.51% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $4.52T $1.18T $478.81B $159.71B $73.03B $23.64B % 11.49% 3% 1.22% 0.41% 0.19% 0.06% Top and Bottom Companies off their highs and lows Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 off the highs -2.56% -12.340% -9.13% -6.86% -6.79% -7.42% off the lows 54.50% 54.221% 48.67% 47.09% 53.02% 54.03% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 off the highs -11.53% -13.56% -14.55% -16.05% -20.23% -19.23% off the lows 65.00% 67.48% 75.81% 67.54% 61.85% 56.65% Top 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated. Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

A 3% move would impact $72 billion dollars in valuation and has a 0.18% impact on the index. Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars. Look at how much of an impact these stocks together make. 1% move 2% move 3% move Top 5 0.23% 0.46% 0.69% Top 10 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Top 20 0.391% 0.78% 1.17% The top 20 companies can make a 1%+ move if they averaged a 3% increase/decrease. So what should I get out of this? The S&P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies. S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.","Out of curiosity, when do you plan to buy in?",3,0.572,0.914,NEGATIVE

So what should I get out of this? The S&P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies. S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful.

All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&P500? In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows).

The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (~86%). As of right now, the S&P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane.

S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.","Index investing requires a hell of a lot less brains and time tracking the stocks, plus bad news for one company that represents 10% of your portfolio still leads to losing twice as much as if you invest in a cap-weighted index of which it represents 5%. Plus, you're betting that the mega cap stocks will outperform the smaller S&P 500 stocks, which was true the last few years and might persist for a few more, but might not necessarily be true forever.",1,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE

All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&P500? In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows). Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $4.96T $6.49T $7.93T $10.76T $14.15T $18.03T % 23.69% 31.02% 37.87% 51.42% 67.62% 86.14% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $2.9T $780.77B $340.88B $92.3B $38.79B $13.11B % 13.86% 3.73% 1.63% 0.44% 0.19% 0.06% The total value gained in the S&P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (~86%). As of right now, the S&P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies.

Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated. Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

It could then partner with Apple and basically consume all mobile devices larger than a phone for retail. Or it could get hit by a storm, the CEO dies in a plane crash, AMD merges with Intel instead and Nvidia dies. Stuff happens, but Vanguard continues on and will be there in 100 years.There are companies out there that will keep on pumping for another 500 years. Companies like JP Morgan (a 200 year old company at this point), Coke, and Ford/Boeing (well at least IMO). I know you and I will be dead before then, but the principle stands that these companies/investments choices will continue on and remain. A lot of companies will die, but you simply can't know this. Even the ones I've mentioned can be hit with a brick 10 times and fall down the stairs and die, stuff happens.A much better strategy that a lot of banks operate is basically they will look at the S&P500, devote teams to each stock, track and pick which one is a dud and which ones work. You will see much better returns as the cost to run an operation is maybe 0.5% of the total invested amount but your gains are like 12-14% (don't take the numbers to heart). But you and I can't do this unless Reddit does a short version with 100 top companies. We can't watch this 24/7 and diversify+operate with certainty.Index investing is lazy but it works, you can't beat it because you don't have the time and effort to do this. Another method is to literally bring out JP Morgans report on the top 100 companies and literally buy the company if it reports a positive gain next year and general outlook.",1,0.552,0.945,NEGATIVE

All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&P500? In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows). Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $4.96T $6.49T $7.93T $10.76T $14.15T $18.03T % 23.69% 31.02% 37.87% 51.42% 67.62% 86.14% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $2.9T $780.77B $340.88B $92.3B $38.79B $13.11B % 13.86% 3.73% 1.63% 0.44% 0.19% 0.06% The total value gained in the S&P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (~86%). As of right now, the S&P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies. Valuations of companies right now Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $9.08T $12.26T $15.67T $21.89T $27.68T $34.86T % 23.05% 31.13% 39.8% 55.59% 70.29% 88.51% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $4.52T $1.18T $478.81B $159.71B $73.03B $23.64B % 11.49% 3% 1.22% 0.41% 0.19% 0.06% Top and Bottom Companies off their highs and lows Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 off the highs -2.56% -12.340% -9.13% -6.86% -6.79% -7.42% off the lows 54.50% 54.221% 48.67% 47.09% 53.02% 54.03% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 off the highs -11.53% -13.56% -14.55% -16.05% -20.23% -19.23% off the lows 65.00% 67.48% 75.81% 67.54% 61.85% 56.65% Top 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated. Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

A 3% move would impact $72 billion dollars in valuation and has a 0.18% impact on the index. Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars. Look at how much of an impact these stocks together make. 1% move 2% move 3% move Top 5 0.23% 0.46% 0.69% Top 10 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Top 20 0.391% 0.78% 1.17% The top 20 companies can make a 1%+ move if they averaged a 3% increase/decrease. So what should I get out of this? The S&P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies. S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.",Do you happen to have a link to JPM’s top 100 report? I can’t seem to find it for some reason,2,0.511,0.98,NEGATIVE

The 2021 JPM outlook will even tell you military conflict outlooks of a US vs China scenario.

It looks like its shooting itself but I really like JPMs explanation that China doesn't want a bubble and is managing its tech industry well. This report even mentions risks with big tech stocks (and I do really agree with them, that big regulation could come), people need to start reading into these more than take stock on Reddit (although Reddit honestly gives better advice than 90% of shit on the web and will shut down dog shit ideas). This report even dives into world currency composition throughout history, honestly, this thing actually shows the risk of investing and really shines a light on stuff Reddit doesn't mention enough.",3,0.526,0.85,NEGATIVE

All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&P500? In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows). Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $4.96T $6.49T $7.93T $10.76T $14.15T $18.03T % 23.69% 31.02% 37.87% 51.42% 67.62% 86.14% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $2.9T $780.77B $340.88B $92.3B $38.79B $13.11B % 13.86% 3.73% 1.63% 0.44% 0.19% 0.06% The total value gained in the S&P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (~86%). As of right now, the S&P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies. Valuations of companies right now Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $9.08T $12.26T $15.67T $21.89T $27.68T $34.86T % 23.05% 31.13% 39.8% 55.59% 70.29% 88.51% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $4.52T $1.18T $478.81B $159.71B $73.03B $23.64B % 11.49% 3% 1.22% 0.41% 0.19% 0.06% Top and Bottom Companies off their highs and lows Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 off the highs -2.56% -12.340% -9.13% -6.86% -6.79% -7.42% off the lows 54.50% 54.221% 48.67% 47.09% 53.02% 54.03% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 off the highs -11.53% -13.56% -14.55% -16.05% -20.23% -19.23% off the lows 65.00% 67.48% 75.81% 67.54% 61.85% 56.65% Top 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated. Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

A 3% move would impact $72 billion dollars in valuation and has a 0.18% impact on the index. Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars. Look at how much of an impact these stocks together make. 1% move 2% move 3% move Top 5 0.23% 0.46% 0.69% Top 10 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Top 20 0.391% 0.78% 1.17% The top 20 companies can make a 1%+ move if they averaged a 3% increase/decrease. So what should I get out of this? The S&P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies. S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.",Hey I really appreciate the in depth comment as well as the links! I’ll def give the stuff a good read,4,0.517,0.968,POSITIVE

The Morgan Stanley one on APPL is basically spot on given the margin of error. Honestly, if you have no idea wtf you're doing and don't want to do ETFs, pick a stock you like widely publicised and go through the reports year by year. I know they are old, but hell, even 1-year-old, these things are pretty damn accurate for stocks. And best of all they're free without the bias of most places.",5,0.593,1.0,POSITIVE

Valuations of companies right now Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $9.08T $12.26T $15.67T $21.89T $27.68T $34.86T % 23.05% 31.13% 39.8% 55.59% 70.29% 88.51% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $4.52T $1.18T $478.81B $159.71B $73.03B $23.64B % 11.49% 3% 1.22% 0.41% 0.19% 0.06% Top and Bottom Companies off their highs and lows Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 off the highs -2.56% -12.340% -9.13% -6.86% -6.79% -7.42% off the lows 54.50% 54.221% 48.67% 47.09% 53.02% 54.03% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 off the highs -11.53% -13.56% -14.55% -16.05% -20.23% -19.23% off the lows 65.00% 67.48% 75.81% 67.54% 61.85% 56.65% Top 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated. Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

A 3% move would impact $72 billion dollars in valuation and has a 0.18% impact on the index. Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars. Look at how much of an impact these stocks together make. 1% move 2% move 3% move Top 5 0.23% 0.46% 0.69% Top 10 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Top 20 0.391% 0.78% 1.17% The top 20 companies can make a 1%+ move if they averaged a 3% increase/decrease. So what should I get out of this? The S&P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies. S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.",VGT's expense rates are almost nothing and do basically this for you...,1,0.508,0.746,NEGATIVE

So what should I get out of this? The S&P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies. S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.",ETFs are probably for people like me who :Do not have a particularly large accountCannot do fractional sharesLack the skill to set up the portfolio weight properly.

All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&P500? In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows).

The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (~86%). As of right now, the S&P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane.

Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated. Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

So what should I get out of this? The S&P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies. S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.","Super useful, thank you!",1,0.5,0.995,POSITIVE

As of market close today, here's the indices: Index Price 52-week range Highs Lows Off highs Off lows S&P 500 $4,358.69 $3,200.05 - $4,393.68 $4,393.68 $3,200.05 -0.80% 36.21% Nasdaq Composite $14,631.95 $10,217.31 - $14,803.68 $14,803.68 $10,217.31 -1.16% 43.21% Dow Jones Industrial Average $34,798.00 $25,992.28 - $35,091.56 $35,091.56 $25,992.28 -0.84% 33.88% Russell 2000 Index $2,234.04 $1,432.57 - $2,360.17 $2,360.17 $1,432.57 -5.34% 55.95% S&P500, NASDAQ, and Dow are about 1% from its highs while the Russell Index is about 5%. All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&P500? In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows). Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $4.96T $6.49T $7.93T $10.76T $14.15T $18.03T % 23.69% 31.02% 37.87% 51.42% 67.62% 86.14% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $2.9T $780.77B $340.88B $92.3B $38.79B $13.11B % 13.86% 3.73% 1.63% 0.44% 0.19% 0.06% The total value gained in the S&P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (~86%). As of right now, the S&P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies. Valuations of companies right now Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $9.08T $12.26T $15.67T $21.89T $27.68T $34.86T % 23.05% 31.13% 39.8% 55.59% 70.29% 88.51% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $4.52T $1.18T $478.81B $159.71B $73.03B $23.64B % 11.49% 3% 1.22% 0.41% 0.19% 0.06% Top and Bottom Companies off their highs and lows Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 off the highs -2.56% -12.340% -9.13% -6.86% -6.79% -7.42% off the lows 54.50% 54.221% 48.67% 47.09% 53.02% 54.03% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 off the highs -11.53% -13.56% -14.55% -16.05% -20.23% -19.23% off the lows 65.00% 67.48% 75.81% 67.54% 61.85% 56.65% Top 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated. Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

Last quarter they grew the top line by over 30% and the bottom line by well over 100% increase YoY. But that is with a Google with plenty of assets yet to be fully monetized plus adding new ones.Honestly Google has really barely got started and tons and tons of runway to work with.,0,0.55,0.603,POSITIVE

All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&P500? In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows). Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $4.96T $6.49T $7.93T $10.76T $14.15T $18.03T % 23.69% 31.02% 37.87% 51.42% 67.62% 86.14% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $2.9T $780.77B $340.88B $92.3B $38.79B $13.11B % 13.86% 3.73% 1.63% 0.44% 0.19% 0.06% The total value gained in the S&P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (~86%). As of right now, the S&P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies. Valuations of companies right now Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $9.08T $12.26T $15.67T $21.89T $27.68T $34.86T % 23.05% 31.13% 39.8% 55.59% 70.29% 88.51% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $4.52T $1.18T $478.81B $159.71B $73.03B $23.64B % 11.49% 3% 1.22% 0.41% 0.19% 0.06% Top and Bottom Companies off their highs and lows Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 off the highs -2.56% -12.340% -9.13% -6.86% -6.79% -7.42% off the lows 54.50% 54.221% 48.67% 47.09% 53.02% 54.03% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 off the highs -11.53% -13.56% -14.55% -16.05% -20.23% -19.23% off the lows 65.00% 67.48% 75.81% 67.54% 61.85% 56.65% Top 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated. Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

A 3% move would impact $72 billion dollars in valuation and has a 0.18% impact on the index. Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars. Look at how much of an impact these stocks together make. 1% move 2% move 3% move Top 5 0.23% 0.46% 0.69% Top 10 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Top 20 0.391% 0.78% 1.17% The top 20 companies can make a 1%+ move if they averaged a 3% increase/decrease. So what should I get out of this? The S&P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies. S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.","Apple actually uses Google for their cloud.""Apple confirms it uses Google’s cloud for iCloud""https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/26/apple-confirms-it-uses-google-cloud-for-icloud.htmlReally would not make sense for Apple to have their own.

Valuations of companies right now Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $9.08T $12.26T $15.67T $21.89T $27.68T $34.86T % 23.05% 31.13% 39.8% 55.59% 70.29% 88.51% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $4.52T $1.18T $478.81B $159.71B $73.03B $23.64B % 11.49% 3% 1.22% 0.41% 0.19% 0.06% Top and Bottom Companies off their highs and lows Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 off the highs -2.56% -12.340% -9.13% -6.86% -6.79% -7.42% off the lows 54.50% 54.221% 48.67% 47.09% 53.02% 54.03% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 off the highs -11.53% -13.56% -14.55% -16.05% -20.23% -19.23% off the lows 65.00% 67.48% 75.81% 67.54% 61.85% 56.65% Top 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated. Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

A 3% move would impact $72 billion dollars in valuation and has a 0.18% impact on the index. Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars. Look at how much of an impact these stocks together make. 1% move 2% move 3% move Top 5 0.23% 0.46% 0.69% Top 10 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Top 20 0.391% 0.78% 1.17% The top 20 companies can make a 1%+ move if they averaged a 3% increase/decrease. So what should I get out of this? The S&P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies. S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.","Personally would own all four, Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft.If going to add a fifth then it would be FB.With the five you have technology well covered. Plus more and more the five will compete against one another.I would expect the five to continue to have really strong growth.

A 3% move would impact $72 billion dollars in valuation and has a 0.18% impact on the index. Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars.

So what should I get out of this? The S&P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies. S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful.

All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&P500?

The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (~86%). As of right now, the S&P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane.

So what should I get out of this? The S&P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies. S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.",It's the split adjusted high. That price was before the split. The stock didn't lose 75% of its value since July lol,2,0.56,1.0,NEGATIVE

All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&P500? In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows). Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $4.96T $6.49T $7.93T $10.76T $14.15T $18.03T % 23.69% 31.02% 37.87% 51.42% 67.62% 86.14% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $2.9T $780.77B $340.88B $92.3B $38.79B $13.11B % 13.86% 3.73% 1.63% 0.44% 0.19% 0.06% The total value gained in the S&P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (~86%). As of right now, the S&P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies.

Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated. Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

As of market close today, here's the indices: Index Price 52-week range Highs Lows Off highs Off lows S&P 500 $4,358.69 $3,200.05 - $4,393.68 $4,393.68 $3,200.05 -0.80% 36.21% Nasdaq Composite $14,631.95 $10,217.31 - $14,803.68 $14,803.68 $10,217.31 -1.16% 43.21% Dow Jones Industrial Average $34,798.00 $25,992.28 - $35,091.56 $35,091.56 $25,992.28 -0.84% 33.88% Russell 2000 Index $2,234.04 $1,432.57 - $2,360.17 $2,360.17 $1,432.57 -5.34% 55.95% S&P500, NASDAQ, and Dow are about 1% from its highs while the Russell Index is about 5%. All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&P500? In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows). Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $4.96T $6.49T $7.93T $10.76T $14.15T $18.03T % 23.69% 31.02% 37.87% 51.42% 67.62% 86.14% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $2.9T $780.77B $340.88B $92.3B $38.79B $13.11B % 13.86% 3.73% 1.63% 0.44% 0.19% 0.06% The total value gained in the S&P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (~86%). As of right now, the S&P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies. Valuations of companies right now Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $9.08T $12.26T $15.67T $21.89T $27.68T $34.86T % 23.05% 31.13% 39.8% 55.59% 70.29% 88.51% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $4.52T $1.18T $478.81B $159.71B $73.03B $23.64B % 11.49% 3% 1.22% 0.41% 0.19% 0.06% Top and Bottom Companies off their highs and lows Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 off the highs -2.56% -12.340% -9.13% -6.86% -6.79% -7.42% off the lows 54.50% 54.221% 48.67% 47.09% 53.02% 54.03% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 off the highs -11.53% -13.56% -14.55% -16.05% -20.23% -19.23% off the lows 65.00% 67.48% 75.81% 67.54% 61.85% 56.65% Top 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated. Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

A 3% move would impact $72 billion dollars in valuation and has a 0.18% impact on the index. Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars. Look at how much of an impact these stocks together make. 1% move 2% move 3% move Top 5 0.23% 0.46% 0.69% Top 10 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Top 20 0.391% 0.78% 1.17% The top 20 companies can make a 1%+ move if they averaged a 3% increase/decrease. So what should I get out of this? The S&P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies. S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful.

Valuations of companies right now Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 $ $9.08T $12.26T $15.67T $21.89T $27.68T $34.86T % 23.05% 31.13% 39.8% 55.59% 70.29% 88.51% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 $ $4.52T $1.18T $478.81B $159.71B $73.03B $23.64B % 11.49% 3% 1.22% 0.41% 0.19% 0.06% Top and Bottom Companies off their highs and lows Top 5 Top 10 Top 20 Top 50 Top 100 Top 250 off the highs -2.56% -12.340% -9.13% -6.86% -6.79% -7.42% off the lows 54.50% 54.221% 48.67% 47.09% 53.02% 54.03% Bottom 250 Bottom 100 Bottom 50 Bottom 20 Bottom 10 Bottom 5 off the highs -11.53% -13.56% -14.55% -16.05% -20.23% -19.23% off the lows 65.00% 67.48% 75.81% 67.54% 61.85% 56.65% Top 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated. Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

A 3% move would impact $72 billion dollars in valuation and has a 0.18% impact on the index. Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars. Look at how much of an impact these stocks together make. 1% move 2% move 3% move Top 5 0.23% 0.46% 0.69% Top 10 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Top 20 0.391% 0.78% 1.17% The top 20 companies can make a 1%+ move if they averaged a 3% increase/decrease. So what should I get out of this? The S&P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies. S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them. Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD. Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down. Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season. Hope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.",Thank you for your work and the interesting insights you provided.,0,0.505,0.966,POSITIVE

Microsoft, Amazon, and Google aren't far behind. The purpose of this post is the look at how much more value the top companies have gained in comparison to to the rest of the market. As of market close today, here's the indices: Index Price 52-week range Highs Lows Off highs Off lows S&P 500 $4,358.69 $3,200.05 - $4,393.68 $4,393.68 $3,200.05 -0.80% 36.21% Nasdaq Composite $14,631.95 $10,217.31 - $14,803.68 $14,803.68 $10,217.31 -1.16% 43.21% Dow Jones Industrial Average $34,798.00 $25,992.28 - $35,091.56 $35,091.56 $25,992.28 -0.84% 33.88% Russell 2000 Index $2,234.04 $1,432.57 - $2,360.17 $2,360.17 $1,432.57 -5.34% 55.95% S&P500, NASDAQ, and Dow are about 1% from its highs while the Russell Index is about 5%. All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&P500? In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows).

The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (~86%). As of right now, the S&P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane.
