,"So I probably made the worst investment possible a couple months ago purchasing 3k worth of Visa stocks. I bought them when it had a small dip, thinking it would go back up, but instead it went down to extreme numbers. I just don't quite understand why Visa is doing so poorly, I had thought this would've been a trustworthy, small risk stock. I haven't sold them yet, but I'm down several hundreds as of now. I know this is a broad question, but is there faith of Visa going back up? Or will it only get worse from here? Thank you in advance.","Dont sell after a couple of bad months, Visa isnt a small risky company that you expect to grow a lot short term. If you sell now you will just lose money, Visa will inevitably recover and you will be sad again.Bull markets wont last forever, sometimes we gotta learn to stomach the red for a while.",0,0.542,1.0,NEGATIVE

Yes many customers like the brand (customer loyalty) but nothing stops competitors from entering the industry and replicating their product.Eagle tree dumping shares in the short term capping price, if you aren’t bothered about that then forget this point.Saturated industry (many gaming peripheral companies such as razer, Logitech, steel series, Corsair, roccat)recent earnings misses not great but could be temporary. Typically I like companies that haven’t missed earnings for a number of quarters in a row.poor operating margins (last 4 years average of 5%, with the exception of 2020 where they had 9% but 2020 involved people staying at home and many people buying peripherals for WFH)Each to their own but when I look for a company to hold long term I want a company that is hard to replace (has an economic moat, like Google which has things like YouTube and Google search).Everybody invests differently but CRSR isn’t a pick for me unfortunately, but don’t let that stop you if you know something I don’t or truly think they’ve got an edge.Disclaimer: I did majority of my DD into CRSR in the last 10 mins so forgive me if I have got something factually incorrect",6,0.534,1.0,NEGATIVE

Every company will have periods of time where they underperform, but over the long-term, Visa has had a great and reliable track record of growth as you can see when you zoom out on the chart.Visa is a quality company with great margins, a very strong moat, and still tons of growth potential since most people in the world are still using cash and the war on cash has begun. I think an investment in Visa is one of the safest investments that you can make for steady growth over the long-term.
