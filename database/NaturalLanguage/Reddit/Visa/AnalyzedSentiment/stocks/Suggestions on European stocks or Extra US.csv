,"Dear all, I maxed out all my retirement accounts, and due to my VISA situation (International Org worker), I don't get taxed on gains and dividends for securities and bonds from Europe and other countries outside the US. I got taxed 30% on any US securities capital gain regardless of short or long term. With my wife, we have an additional 4K monthly that we can invest, and I wanted to harness your collective intelligence on some good ideas to take advantage of this situation. I have a 2.75% mortgage, and I would rather prefer to invest in something relatively conservative that can give me more of that and eventually, in a decade, pay it off if needed. Any advice would be super appreciated!",Hedge against inflation a little with some precious metals exposure. WPM GNT SAND MTA FNV etc. are good streamer investments. üçÄ,0,0.511,0.793,POSITIVE
