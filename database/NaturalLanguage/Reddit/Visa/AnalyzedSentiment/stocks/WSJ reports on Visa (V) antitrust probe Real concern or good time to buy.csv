Plenty of events are sponsored by them, like MA sponsoring a big festival, which lead to a nice perk of being able to pay with my phone at food booths, etc. MA also seems to be used by most challenger banks, by the way (both international and local). And this is in a country with an aging population that is relatively conservative when it comes to finances and has an aging population. So it seems to me like they invest in these markets, because they see growth in EU.Another thing I noticed when I was in Croatia a few years apart. The first time, you could only pay by cash in most places outside resorts, and had to use their currency. A few years later, most places accepted cards, and almost every restaurant had logos of either Visa or MasterCard engraved on the cover page of the bill holders, which I've never seen here, but seemed like an interesting strategy.
