,"Summary: Affirm is a major player in the booming “point of sale financing” or “buy now pay later” niche. Affirm lets online shoppers choose an installment plan at checkout. The point of sale financing market exploded during the pandemic and is expected to keep growing fast. Competitor Afterpay was recently acquired by Square, and there is speculation that Affirm may be an acquisition target. What they do: Affirm operates a point-of-sale payment solution for consumers. Its payment network allows consumers to pay for purchases with an installment plan. Affirm pays the merchant the full amount upfront. They charge an APR of 10 to 30 percent, depending on the plan and on the buyer’s credit. The Affirm app makes it easy for buyers to keep track of payments and sends reminders. Affirm also receives a fee from merchants. Online sellers have found that point-of-sale financing increases sales volume and reduces cart abandonment, so they are willing to pay for the service. There were over 12,000 active merchants using the Affirm platform in March 2021, more than double the number in the same quarter of 2020. Active consumers grew 60% to 5.4 million in the same period. Gross merchandise volume grew 83% to $2.3 billion. Affirm has an exclusive relationship with Shopify ($SHOP), and provides point-of-sale financing to Shopify merchants. Shopify is a leading competitor to Amazon. They are growing at a wild rate: gross merchandise volume was up 119% in the last reported quarter and the number of merchants with Shopify stores has been rising at 126% a year. Shopify now powers over 1.7 million businesses in more than 175 countries. Affirm’s relationship with Shopify allows them to offer their services to an enormous and rapidly growing customer base. Why they’re spiking in interest: Reddit mentions of $AFRM in the last 8 days leaped 875% from the previous 8-day period. The surge was kicked off by the August 3 news that Affirm will work with Apple ($AAPL) to provide installment plans for Apple device purchasers in Canada. That announcement was followed on August 5 with news that Square ($SQ) is acquiring Australian buy-now-pay-later provider Afterpay for $29 billion. Affirm shares gained 18% on the combined news. The Square/Afterpay combination will provide competition for Affirm, but it also brought attention to the sector. There has been speculation that another major player seeking to move into the buy-now-pay-later space will acquire Affirm rather than develop their own system. Shopify (which already owns 7.6% of Affirm), PayPal, and even card giants like Visa and Mastercard have been suggested as potentially interested in acquiring Affirm. Notable comments from Reddit: ""I’m long on $AFRM. The financial sector is dinosaurs through and through. If you’ve ever applied for (and received) a mortgage, it’s a nightmare. It requires little imagination on my part for Affirm or “Green Sky” to open up to home and auto loans."" - PinBot1138 “People should probably get AFRM for when it gets acquired for a free 30%.”- Lukebreit Signal: Over 77% of the $AFRM float is held by institutions. Scottish investment management firm Baillie Gifford is the largest institutional holder, with over $75 million worth of shares. Why $AFRM could be valuable: The buy-now-pay-later has enormous upward momentum. Sales have increased dramatically and the increase is expected to continue. McKinsey & Company’s annual POS Financing Survey found that about 60% of consumers are likely to use point-of-sale financing over the next six to 12 months. Affirm founder and CEO Max Levchin has a record of developing successful and innovative payment systems: he’s one of the founders of PayPal. Affirm does not charge late payment fees and has a fixed monthly payment system. This feature is attractive to users who are concerned with the complexities of credit card billing and payment. Affirm’s Net Promoter Score - a measure of customer loyalty - places the company at 78, above Amazon and just below Apple. 64% of transactions are from repeat users, and repeat customers spend an average of $2,200 per year. Delinquency rates were just over 1% in 2020. Six of 10 analysts covering the stock rate it “Buy”, with the other 4 placing it at “Hold”. The consensus price target is $76.71, 14% above the current level. Rapid user growth, high customer retention, and a rapidly expanding market add up to very strong growth prospects for $AFRM. The stock has dropped to under 50% of its post-IPO surge of $140 per share and has settled into a steady band in the $60-$70 range. Post-IPO hype often drives new listings to unrealistic valuations. When they drop back to a more realistic level many retail investors become frustrated and drop out. That leaves a core of institutional holders and a strong base for appreciation of positive news. What the risks are: Affirm is not profitable and is not expected to achieve profitability soon. The Company also has a high debt/equity ratio of 87.95%. The Company has adequate working capital but the combination of debt and losses is still a concern. Affirm operates in a highly competitive market. Right now that market is dominated by relatively new companies like Afterpay, and Klarna. The sector’s rapid growth could attract competition from larger companies with greater financial capacity than Affirm. Affirm faces credit risk. Default rates have been extremely low, but unexpected events could drive them high enough to affect the Company’s results. Affirm is exposed to a potential economic downturn. A recession could reduce the discretionary purchases that drive much of the Company’s gross merchandise volume and increase default rates. The buy-now-pay-later sector could attract increased government regulation, which could affect the Company's results and stock price. Bottom line: Affirm’s lack of profitability makes it a speculative play. But its rapid revenue growth and established position in an exploding market make it an interesting speculative play. There is strong potential for acquisition and for medium to long-term growth. Watch for the release of Q4 and full FY 2021 results, scheduled for Sept. 9.

What the risks are: Affirm is not profitable and is not expected to achieve profitability soon. The Company also has a high debt/equity ratio of 87.95%. The Company has adequate working capital but the combination of debt and losses is still a concern. Affirm operates in a highly competitive market. Right now that market is dominated by relatively new companies like Afterpay, and Klarna. The sector’s rapid growth could attract competition from larger companies with greater financial capacity than Affirm. Affirm faces credit risk. Default rates have been extremely low, but unexpected events could drive them high enough to affect the Company’s results. Affirm is exposed to a potential economic downturn.

,"Summary: Affirm is a major player in the booming “point of sale financing” or “buy now pay later” niche. Affirm lets online shoppers choose an installment plan at checkout. The point of sale financing market exploded during the pandemic and is expected to keep growing fast. Competitor Afterpay was recently acquired by Square, and there is speculation that Affirm may be an acquisition target. What they do: Affirm operates a point-of-sale payment solution for consumers. Its payment network allows consumers to pay for purchases with an installment plan. Affirm pays the merchant the full amount upfront. They charge an APR of 10 to 30 percent, depending on the plan and on the buyer’s credit. The Affirm app makes it easy for buyers to keep track of payments and sends reminders. Affirm also receives a fee from merchants. Online sellers have found that point-of-sale financing increases sales volume and reduces cart abandonment, so they are willing to pay for the service. There were over 12,000 active merchants using the Affirm platform in March 2021, more than double the number in the same quarter of 2020. Active consumers grew 60% to 5.4 million in the same period. Gross merchandise volume grew 83% to $2.3 billion. Affirm has an exclusive relationship with Shopify ($SHOP), and provides point-of-sale financing to Shopify merchants. Shopify is a leading competitor to Amazon. They are growing at a wild rate: gross merchandise volume was up 119% in the last reported quarter and the number of merchants with Shopify stores has been rising at 126% a year. Shopify now powers over 1.7 million businesses in more than 175 countries. Affirm’s relationship with Shopify allows them to offer their services to an enormous and rapidly growing customer base. Why they’re spiking in interest: Reddit mentions of $AFRM in the last 8 days leaped 875% from the previous 8-day period. The surge was kicked off by the August 3 news that Affirm will work with Apple ($AAPL) to provide installment plans for Apple device purchasers in Canada. That announcement was followed on August 5 with news that Square ($SQ) is acquiring Australian buy-now-pay-later provider Afterpay for $29 billion. Affirm shares gained 18% on the combined news. The Square/Afterpay combination will provide competition for Affirm, but it also brought attention to the sector.

,"Summary: Affirm is a major player in the booming “point of sale financing” or “buy now pay later” niche. Affirm lets online shoppers choose an installment plan at checkout. The point of sale financing market exploded during the pandemic and is expected to keep growing fast. Competitor Afterpay was recently acquired by Square, and there is speculation that Affirm may be an acquisition target. What they do: Affirm operates a point-of-sale payment solution for consumers. Its payment network allows consumers to pay for purchases with an installment plan. Affirm pays the merchant the full amount upfront. They charge an APR of 10 to 30 percent, depending on the plan and on the buyer’s credit. The Affirm app makes it easy for buyers to keep track of payments and sends reminders. Affirm also receives a fee from merchants. Online sellers have found that point-of-sale financing increases sales volume and reduces cart abandonment, so they are willing to pay for the service. There were over 12,000 active merchants using the Affirm platform in March 2021, more than double the number in the same quarter of 2020. Active consumers grew 60% to 5.4 million in the same period. Gross merchandise volume grew 83% to $2.3 billion. Affirm has an exclusive relationship with Shopify ($SHOP), and provides point-of-sale financing to Shopify merchants. Shopify is a leading competitor to Amazon. They are growing at a wild rate: gross merchandise volume was up 119% in the last reported quarter and the number of merchants with Shopify stores has been rising at 126% a year. Shopify now powers over 1.7 million businesses in more than 175 countries. Affirm’s relationship with Shopify allows them to offer their services to an enormous and rapidly growing customer base. Why they’re spiking in interest: Reddit mentions of $AFRM in the last 8 days leaped 875% from the previous 8-day period. The surge was kicked off by the August 3 news that Affirm will work with Apple ($AAPL) to provide installment plans for Apple device purchasers in Canada. That announcement was followed on August 5 with news that Square ($SQ) is acquiring Australian buy-now-pay-later provider Afterpay for $29 billion. Affirm shares gained 18% on the combined news. The Square/Afterpay combination will provide competition for Affirm, but it also brought attention to the sector. There has been speculation that another major player seeking to move into the buy-now-pay-later space will acquire Affirm rather than develop their own system. Shopify (which already owns 7.6% of Affirm), PayPal, and even card giants like Visa and Mastercard have been suggested as potentially interested in acquiring Affirm. Notable comments from Reddit: ""I’m long on $AFRM. The financial sector is dinosaurs through and through. If you’ve ever applied for (and received) a mortgage, it’s a nightmare.

Competitor Afterpay was recently acquired by Square, and there is speculation that Affirm may be an acquisition target. What they do: Affirm operates a point-of-sale payment solution for consumers.

,"Summary: Affirm is a major player in the booming “point of sale financing” or “buy now pay later” niche. Affirm lets online shoppers choose an installment plan at checkout. The point of sale financing market exploded during the pandemic and is expected to keep growing fast. Competitor Afterpay was recently acquired by Square, and there is speculation that Affirm may be an acquisition target. What they do: Affirm operates a point-of-sale payment solution for consumers. Its payment network allows consumers to pay for purchases with an installment plan. Affirm pays the merchant the full amount upfront. They charge an APR of 10 to 30 percent, depending on the plan and on the buyer’s credit. The Affirm app makes it easy for buyers to keep track of payments and sends reminders. Affirm also receives a fee from merchants. Online sellers have found that point-of-sale financing increases sales volume and reduces cart abandonment, so they are willing to pay for the service. There were over 12,000 active merchants using the Affirm platform in March 2021, more than double the number in the same quarter of 2020. Active consumers grew 60% to 5.4 million in the same period. Gross merchandise volume grew 83% to $2.3 billion. Affirm has an exclusive relationship with Shopify ($SHOP), and provides point-of-sale financing to Shopify merchants. Shopify is a leading competitor to Amazon. They are growing at a wild rate: gross merchandise volume was up 119% in the last reported quarter and the number of merchants with Shopify stores has been rising at 126% a year. Shopify now powers over 1.7 million businesses in more than 175 countries. Affirm’s relationship with Shopify allows them to offer their services to an enormous and rapidly growing customer base. Why they’re spiking in interest: Reddit mentions of $AFRM in the last 8 days leaped 875% from the previous 8-day period. The surge was kicked off by the August 3 news that Affirm will work with Apple ($AAPL) to provide installment plans for Apple device purchasers in Canada. That announcement was followed on August 5 with news that Square ($SQ) is acquiring Australian buy-now-pay-later provider Afterpay for $29 billion. Affirm shares gained 18% on the combined news. The Square/Afterpay combination will provide competition for Affirm, but it also brought attention to the sector. There has been speculation that another major player seeking to move into the buy-now-pay-later space will acquire Affirm rather than develop their own system. Shopify (which already owns 7.6% of Affirm), PayPal, and even card giants like Visa and Mastercard have been suggested as potentially interested in acquiring Affirm. Notable comments from Reddit: ""I’m long on $AFRM. The financial sector is dinosaurs through and through. If you’ve ever applied for (and received) a mortgage, it’s a nightmare. It requires little imagination on my part for Affirm or “Green Sky” to open up to home and auto loans."" - PinBot1138 “People should probably get AFRM for when it gets acquired for a free 30%.”- Lukebreit Signal: Over 77% of the $AFRM float is held by institutions. Scottish investment management firm Baillie Gifford is the largest institutional holder, with over $75 million worth of shares. Why $AFRM could be valuable: The buy-now-pay-later has enormous upward momentum. Sales have increased dramatically and the increase is expected to continue. McKinsey & Company’s annual POS Financing Survey found that about 60% of consumers are likely to use point-of-sale financing over the next six to 12 months. Affirm founder and CEO Max Levchin has a record of developing successful and innovative payment systems: he’s one of the founders of PayPal. Affirm does not charge late payment fees and has a fixed monthly payment system. This feature is attractive to users who are concerned with the complexities of credit card billing and payment. Affirm’s Net Promoter Score - a measure of customer loyalty - places the company at 78, above Amazon and just below Apple. 64% of transactions are from repeat users, and repeat customers spend an average of $2,200 per year. Delinquency rates were just over 1% in 2020. Six of 10 analysts covering the stock rate it “Buy”, with the other 4 placing it at “Hold”. The consensus price target is $76.71, 14% above the current level. Rapid user growth, high customer retention, and a rapidly expanding market add up to very strong growth prospects for $AFRM. The stock has dropped to under 50% of its post-IPO surge of $140 per share and has settled into a steady band in the $60-$70 range. Post-IPO hype often drives new listings to unrealistic valuations. When they drop back to a more realistic level many retail investors become frustrated and drop out. That leaves a core of institutional holders and a strong base for appreciation of positive news. What the risks are: Affirm is not profitable and is not expected to achieve profitability soon. The Company also has a high debt/equity ratio of 87.95%. The Company has adequate working capital but the combination of debt and losses is still a concern. Affirm operates in a highly competitive market. Right now that market is dominated by relatively new companies like Afterpay, and Klarna.
