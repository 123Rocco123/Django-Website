,"What is that one stock you already OWN in your portfolio that comes to mind? Something you’re happy to own & buy more of when opportunities allow Beyond the magnificent 7, mine would be Visa, incredible margins and business operations.","Ignore 2021-2022, because of the double spike in lumber prices as well as printing 1/3 of the money supply. Otherwise 2012-2023 is solid earnings, I’d say 2023 is more normalized than the prior two years.As far as risk, I’d say the risk now would be it’s too high of a price to buy at for my approach.When I bought at $69.05, I didn’t see many risks whatsoever. Cash was about 1/3 of equity, and cash flow from operations was sufficient to payoff their issued debt of around $444mln in less than a year. Not a lot of risk when a company has virtually no debt. Can’t go Bk that way.They had about $12 of net cash per share (cash less debt), so really you were acquiring the core operations for about $12 less than what you paid for at market price. Back then it was like 15%-20% of the share price which is really a huge strength.Right now you’ll notice a large cash balance, but their last financials said the Brosco acquisition and the $5.20 in Q3 dividends weren’t yet accounted for. So personally I’m really interested to see cash on hand at FYE 2023.Anyways I digress. I’d say the biggest risk would be if they stop expanding their distribution supply chain. This is their durable competitive advantage, no peer has a distribution network as robust as they do.This allows them to be the low cost leader. I’ve spoken with contractors who use them, and they say BCC can deliver to the job site in 2 days, they are cheaper than builders first source and ABC supply.So that’s likely the vertically integrated lumber manufacturing and the proximity of their distribution to active construction zones, and their manufacturing centers proximity to their distribution centers all working in their favor.A large competitor with deep pockets could out build them eventually if one wanted to spend that much time and energy into rapid capex, but you’d be able to see that coming by looking at peers capex/revenue and locations every year (this is what I am doing).Another risk would be the volatility of lumber prices and housing starts, but if you buy low enough this isn’t a risk. And over the long run this doesn’t matter.You also have to keep in mind that construction is a cyclical industry. Every winter it slows because the rain delays projects.So in my mind the real risk is whether or not they keep on expanding their MOAT (distribution network). And whether a competitor comes out of the blue.Another risk might be that their biggest concentration is with Home Depot. And if you understand the Porter Model, you’ll know this gives their customer the advantage. And if Home Depot ever switched, it could be an issue for BCC. On the flip side though, BCC likely has leverage as well because they can control quality and delivery so strongly.So I’d say worst thing would be a peer like Weyerhouser or Builders First Source or United Forestry going insane on their own building materials distribution network.A company with a cash and debt position like BCC will be able to handle any fluctuations in the housing and construction and lumber markets just fine. Their historical record also speaks to this.If, their cash warchest they have vanished or they took on a lot of debt. In other words became a company I did not see strength in to weather the volatility of its industry or acquire other businesses when needed, I would be concerned and would likely sell.I’ve also asked contractors why not just substitute their engineered products for say, dimensional lumber (putting a few 2x4’s together) and they said the products are just an easy install so they don’t bother substituting.I find this one to be a very solid opportunity, but wouldn’t buy unless it was $69 or lower.",2,0.541,NEGATIVE,0.949
