,"A red day today many analysts are saying that the Nasdaq is due to a retracement. Stocks like Google, Amazon, Apple, etc went down today and there’s speculation of a 5% drop due to the decline in that sector. What’s your plan? What are recent stocks you bought and in which sector? Im still holding Google, Paypal, Microsoft and Amazon but to diversify I recently added MasterCard, Visa, CocaCola, PepsiCo, McDonalds, STB, Walmart, Berkshire and Hathaway, Alibaba and XPEV (Ev company). Looking forward to add ABNB, NIO, BABA and maaaybe NVIDIA What do you think? Which stocks are you most bullish on?","Analysts can say whatever they want. At the end of the day, they're speculating. Flip a coin and you'll probably beat those analyst predictionA 5% drop is just a buying opportunity. Nothing to be afraid of. With their earnings coming up, I highly doubt it'll happen",0,0.514,0.728,NEGATIVE

Feeling September when extra benefits end, student loans becomes an issue again, and after this last round of Tech earnings late July.Maybe just scared investors because of the hearing with Powell listening to some of congress spread doom and gloom. Generally the same Debbie downers as always.",0,0.536,1.0,NEGATIVE

Which stocks are you most bullish on?","Thats true, I believe there’s a bunch of scared investors, although many people are speculating that’s due to a rise in inflation. Correct me if I’m wrong but tech companies usually underperform under this circumstances right? You also have to pair it that a lot of them are at their all time highs so: scared people due to inflation + a rise in price in most companies… maybe it’s time to move to other sectos like healthcare or banks which usually thrive under this circumstances. Have you been looking at CITI? Might be a good option(?)Also, with all that, are you still bullish on tech? Like google or amazon or even apple?",1,0.522,1.0,NEGATIVE

Afterwards see growth and recovery/holiday plays, then finally inflation plays. Financials, energy, and many others are some of the main beneficiaries of inflation, and they're not really popping right now. Just down across the board, so makes me believe that this isn't a doomsday scenario quite yet.I believe a correction will be coming, but we're just too close to earnings of major S&P 500 players for them to potentially exit a position and potentially miss on half a year of gains. My opinion although. I will personally exit my positions in mid to late August and just chill out. I could be wrong, but I'm quite content with my gains so far. I understand you can't time the market, but for my mental I don't wish to be involved with the volatile market come near that time.",2,0.539,0.522,POSITIVE
