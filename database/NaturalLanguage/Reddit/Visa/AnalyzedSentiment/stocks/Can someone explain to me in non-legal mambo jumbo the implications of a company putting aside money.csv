,"Who can explain to me how a company pays for putting aside money for possible class action litigation? If it is share related what effect does it have on the overall number of shares? Why does a company needs to do so (is it government mandated or is it just to cover their butt)? Visa called it retrospective responsibility plan. How is this amount determined? This is what I found and I can’t understand it. Conversion feature. Under the terms of the plan, when the Company funds the escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. This has the same effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, by reducing the as-converted class B common stock share count. I have been a share holder of visa for a long time. Information link that is making my head hurt. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000119312511315956/R12.htm","This is the same as a bank putting aside money to cover loan losses.Visa expects that there will be lawsuits, and that they might lose some of them. They put money aside just in case, so if they end up losing, it's already paid for. If they win or the suit goes away, they pull that money back into their operating cash.I think the class B stuff is a different topic, completely unrelated, but I only scanned what you linked.On a side note, this is a good lesson for people on how a company can manipulate their earnings. Suppose they earned 2 billion but wanted to show less. They could take an accounting charge for 1 billion and put that money in reserve. They still have the billion, but they pay less in taxes by only showing 1 billion in income. If they had a bad quarter and wanted to fluff up their earnings in the future, they could reverse a portion of that reserve and show higher earnings than they actually had. It is so important to actually read and understand the financial statements.",0,0.532,1.0,NEGATIVE

Stay away!""V was a little slow to the party, but look at their % returns since IPO.In hindsight, there was some truth to the warchest cry; they fended off some lawsuits, paid others off, etc. Having a ton of money can do wonders.A little different then class actions, but having a boatload of money always helps, especially when you need to buy good lawyers.",0,0.513,0.993,NEGATIVE
