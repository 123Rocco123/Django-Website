,"Link here. Per the article, this was seen as a way for Amazon to bully V into lowering it's fees in the UK. Ironically, MA has almost identical fees in the UK, I wonder if they're trying to push both MA and V into lowering their transaction fees? Regardless, I think this is great news for V https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/17/amazon-halts-plan-to-stop-accepting-visa-credit-cards-in-the-uk.html","I’m sure they’ll drop MA after V lowers their fees or gives them a special deal, they can’t drop the 2 biggest card companies in the world at the same time but targeting them individual is a good strategy.It may just be a bluff too Amazon will probably come out saying they canceled the plans if VESA never caves.",0,0.52,0.981,NEGATIVE

The only time the FTC would get involved is if Amazon was paying visa for the lower fees but even that isn’t a hard and fast rule it depends on how much the deal would be hurting visa if it wasn’t for the pay check they where getting from Amazon.",2,0.513,0.996,POSITIVE
