,"I was reading this post by the Man Institute and realized that there are companies in certain kind of business that can help the government & policy makers help build real-time inflation indices, which in turn would help the government & policy makers make decisions that benefit the people that actually require them. The companies can - Make this real - time data available publicly so that there is transparency and users do not feel like their data is being exploited Data can be anonymous and not on an individual basis, and can be aggregated to show which products & services are purchased by the majority and which products & services are basic necessities versus luxury products & services Examples - Consider an example where majority of the people purchase groceries from Amazon, and the prices of which have increased 100%. Now the government & policy makers can further analyze if this increase in groceries is due to increase in cost of seeds or an increase in cost of fertilizers or an increase in cost of fuel for transport or probably an increase in all of them. After they have determined the causes for higher prices, they can work on mitigating the causes through lower taxes, or some kind of subsidy, or working on different sourcing contracts. E-Commerce companies - such as Amazon has data on the goods & services that people purchase. It can use this data to actually show how the purchasing power of customers is affected in real time and using the kind of goods & services that are purchased. The reason for their increase in prices can also be determined. If the root cause of inflation can be determined and how it hurts specific goods then the government & policy makers can take appropriate actions. Payment Gateway companies - such as Mastercard & Visa can do the same thing as Amazon which has been described above. Real Estate Aggregators - such as Zillow can give out rental and sales data which can be used as described above. Companies such as Google and Facebook may not be able to provide accurate data as the above 3, because the above 3 are final purchases whereas Google and Facebook might be used to search for options or browse through the available options. Note - the above was just a thought and I immediately posted it here. I obviously haven't thought about it thoroughly, and your opinions, ideas, and criticisms are more than welcome, Cheers!","Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.To everyone commenting: Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.If you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on ""relevant subreddits"" and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
