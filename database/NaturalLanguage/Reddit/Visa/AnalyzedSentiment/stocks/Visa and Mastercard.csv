There are a lot of growth stocks out there that reduce friction beyond what VISA / MA offer. That being said, I think they still have the edge in the medium term.",0,0.561,POSITIVE,0.773

Last time I was at the dentist, I paid using that. Same as last time I purchased something from a website I am not familiar with, don't have to risk putting in my credit card number.I don't know what both V and MA are doing in terms of innovation but NFC (what most people call WiFi or touch) in credit cards is not safe either, they can be charged even while you are walking in the street. Pretty sure they can also be copied.I don't really use my PayPal account but I think it would be a superior payment technology in the future than both credit card giants.",0,0.526,NEGATIVE,1.0
