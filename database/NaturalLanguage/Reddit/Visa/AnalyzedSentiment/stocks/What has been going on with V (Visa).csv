,"Visa used to be one of the best investments in my portfolio. I had to sell right before Covid to purchase a home. At the time, it killed me, but almost two years later the company is almost unchanged? I no longer own any. Once I sold I stopped paying attention so I don’t have all the reasoning for the flat growth. Is the stock still a buy in peoples minds? Or does it still have a rocky road ahead? The price looks good to me but I’m not looking to buy a dividend stock without growth potential.","I don’t know how to value visa. As a card, I think they have more competition and pricing pressure every day. But as “AWS for payments” I think the potential is limitless. I’m thinking of them as a “payments infrastructure” play. They process 1700 payments a second but I’m told they could handle many times that. They have never been hacked. They could become the global backbone for all financial transactions. I just have no idea what that is worth.",0,0.521,0.92,POSITIVE

They seem to have lost their moat with all the fintechs entering the market, big retailers like Amazon trying to negotiate lower fees and payment processors in general are getting hit. One of their potential drivers for growth - India is promoting their own payment processor. They don't have the stranglehold they seemed to have had once upon a time. American Express faced a similar collapse back in 2015 I think when Costco didn't renew their contract and signed up with Visa.",0,0.527,0.999,NEGATIVE

I added last year and now. But they are smaller positions. They will keep generating a boatload of cash and will do more buybacks and dividend growth. They are also putting capital into the fintech space so those will take time to show up on the income statement. They are tech in their heart so they will reinvent along with the times. They were on the cusp of acquiring Plaid but that was blocked by the authorities. I just think this will take a while to play out but I expect PE compression similar to what American Express faced along the way after the financial crisis. American Express only recently exhibited some PE expansion. Having said that, Visa went down from a close to half a trillion dollar market cap to 400B in market cap. So they really have to deliver to expand market cap. So a lot hinges on reopening in the short to medium term.",2,0.545,0.767,NEGATIVE

It very much still is a duopoly when comparing transaction volume.

Mastercard, Amex and PayPal are also down.What I'm saying, is that Open Banking and BNPL, and other fintech payments are going to eat away at their share. No merchant likes paying multiple % in fees on when their margins are already like 7% so if there is an opportunity to reduce those, they will take it.Integration with larger merchants, e.g. a BNPL option on Amazon, ASOS etc where you regularly buy from, customers may take it and it'll save the company money on card fees.",2,0.547,0.994,NEGATIVE
