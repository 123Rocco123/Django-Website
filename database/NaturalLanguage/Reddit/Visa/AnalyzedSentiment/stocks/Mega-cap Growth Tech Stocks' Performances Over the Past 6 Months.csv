I've traded the stock back and forth since February, and I can tell you that the stock was mostly not doing much of anything for long stretches, and then it finally had a big breakout, that pushed it above $100. This happened in this most recent 6 month period, so it seems like AMD is this outstanding performer in the most recent 6 months, but for 4 of those months, it didn't do much of anything.I still love AMD by the way. One of my favorite stocks going forward.(Pro Tip - If you plan on going LONG on AMD, with no plans to sell the stock in the next 90 days, then do yourself a huge favor and buy shares of XLNX instead of AMD. The merger has an 85 percent chance of being approved, and if so, you get 1.7234 shares of AMD for each share of XLNX. If you run the numbers right now, it's like buying an AMD share with a $12/$13 off per share coupon. However, if you plan to swing trade AMD, and you might be selling in the next 90 days, then it's better to stay with AMD shares for this purpose)",0,0.592,0.998,NEGATIVE
