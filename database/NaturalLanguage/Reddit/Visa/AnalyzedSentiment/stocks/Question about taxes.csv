,"I have a questions about paying taxes. I recently started investing (like 2 weeks ago) and I have made 100$ profit since then. Tax szn is starting and I want to make sure that I dont eff smth up. I have not transferred any money I made into my bank account. After selling a stock, I always reinvest that money. So my question is does that count as ""earning money"", if i have not taken anything out of ""the app"", and if I need to declare that for taxes or smth. I dont know if it will help but I am an international student in the United States with an F1 Visa.","Welcome to r/stocks!For beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our Wiki here.If you're wondering why a stock moved a certain way, check out Finviz which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see Reuters, and even Yahoo Finance.Please direct all simple questions towards the stickied Daily Discussion and Quarterly Rate My Portfolio threads (sort by Hot, they're at the top).Also include some due diligence to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Which means it doesn’t matter if you withdraw the money out of your account afterwards, if you sold something, you’re on the hook for the capital gains.",0,0.549,0.914,NEGATIVE

I dont know if it will help but I am an international student in the United States with an F1 Visa.",Short answer is yes but it only counts for taxes filed next year.Longer answerTaxes in the U.S. have to be filed by April 15th for the previous year so we're filling for income made between January 1st and December 31st of 2020.If you made 100 dollars in the last 2 weeks you will not put it on taxes until you file next year.If you did any paid work last year you will have to file taxes. Being an international student has its own problems so it would probably be best to ask an accountant who has experience with international students.Just hazarding a guess but if you can afford to go to college in the U.S. you can probably afford the 100 to 200 Usd to have daid accountant to do your taxes for you.Also if you're in a college town there's probably a few you can interview and it might be much cheaper than I estimated.,0,0.553,1.0,NEGATIVE

The U.S. has some really weird laws when it comes to visas so good luck.",2,0.56,0.551,NEGATIVE
