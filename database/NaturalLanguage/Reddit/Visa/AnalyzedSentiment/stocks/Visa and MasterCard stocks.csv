I mean they are used for just about every credit card transaction globally- prove me wrong?,"I have a very unpopular opinion on this but I think both are bad investments currently. They are pretty overvalued based on extremely high profit margins that they won’t be able to keep up forever. They’re prehistoric beasts trying to hop on current growth trends through acquisitions (which then get lost inside their corporate jungle) - companies like PayPal, wechat/alipay, BNPL will eat their lunch.The foundation for their current success was laid decades ago - they have not innovated since then and are not currently laying the foundations for future success",0,0.521,1.0,NEGATIVE

,First time poster LT lurker… Seems like visa and mc are no brainers for investing- just curious what others think about this. I mean they are used for just about every credit card transaction globally- prove me wrong?,so why is apple pay partnered with MA? why is square partnered with MA?all these companies are partnered with MA because they cant compete with them and dont want todo some more research your comment is ridiculous and shows how little you knowthe previous CEO said that they dont even see these other companies as competitors due to the large amount of cash transactions still happening that they are competing more against cash than they are with other companiesMA and V have tons more room to growand not innovating?haha you seriously need to do some proper research and not write a bullshit comment.......................if they are so far behind like i said above why are apple pay and SQ using MA technology and platform to process their transactions? apple one of the biggest companies in the world is using MA technology and platform and you are saying they dont innovate haha get a griphttps://www.forbes.com/sites/howardhyu/2020/01/31/why-visa-and-mastercard-are-todays-most-exciting-fintech-innovators/?sh=375f4e663ed1MA and V stock will continue for the foreseeable future to grow and grow more and more,1,0.537,1.0,NEGATIVE

,First time poster LT lurker… Seems like visa and mc are no brainers for investing- just curious what others think about this. I mean they are used for just about every credit card transaction globally- prove me wrong?,"Agree.Taking china as an example, they skipped the credit card phrase and moved from cash to Fintech (alipay/WeChat pay) quite easily and drastically.The only thing going for visa, mc and amex is the rewards points which hooks consumers on. I see no other great advantages in owning a credit card.Merchant side, I have seen alot of merchants pushing for Google pay, apple pay, PayPal, swipe etc.... Before they suggest u to use credit card, because they charge merchants quite a high % for transactions.Banks wise, I have felt that the banks are finding credit cards to be less profitable as people start paying on time and being more careful with their spending, thus choking the interest rate they can charge for your late payments or non payments.Credit card Company wise, they have a very decent share of the payment market and that will probably be their only moat for now.Competitor wise, the fintechs are promoting change of usage quite aggressively. From where I come from, you get scratch cards, reward points and discounts for using their payment method.Most fintechs I know are currently working hand in hand with credit card companies to improve adaptation. But once the fintechs get a major foothold of the market, they will start going at it alone, cutting out the credit card companies.As credit cards are pretty much of our everyday lives, I don't see it losing the battle so soon, but in the next 10-20 years, this landscape is definitely going to change.My humble two cents",1,0.519,0.993,NEGATIVE
,First time poster LT lurker… Seems like visa and mc are no brainers for investing- just curious what others think about this. I mean they are used for just about every credit card transaction globally- prove me wrong?,"A lot of those fintechs you mention are currently using Visa or Mastercard in the background. Apple Pay is Visa under the hood, if I recall correctly. They are far more than just credit card providers, they are international payment networks, credit and debit card providers, on demand payment service providers, token service providers, and about a million other things tooIn China, they've been effectively locked out as providers and China Union Pay - now Union Pay International - does the bulk of that market. But its not relevant to then because China is effectively a closed market and international fintech stays the fuck away from there because they require technology transfer.",2,0.536,1.0,NEGATIVE
,First time poster LT lurker… Seems like visa and mc are no brainers for investing- just curious what others think about this. I mean they are used for just about every credit card transaction globally- prove me wrong?,The way the ApplePay and GooglePay are setup would make transitioning it from credit card companies to a Fintech solution pretty simple.,3,0.522,0.812,POSITIVE
,First time poster LT lurker… Seems like visa and mc are no brainers for investing- just curious what others think about this. I mean they are used for just about every credit card transaction globally- prove me wrong?,"I'm not sure how familiar you are with the solutions but I would disagree with that statement. They may be easily able to spread across different payment solutions but they will still need underlying payment infrastructure to get from A to B (or P2P, or B2C, or B2B).The requirements for this infrastructure are quite high - not just hardware (although there is a difference in focus as transactions cannot be lost) but also in terms of regulatory oversight. You can't just start routing transactions without dealing with KYC (Know your customer) AMLA (Anti-Money Laundering) and other financial requirements.Visa and MasterCard aren't stupid. Their fees get complained about but they're juuuuust low enough that the investment to replace their payment infrastructure is not attractive. It doesn't mean that they cannot misstep or be challenged, but they have done a good job of keeping up with, and sometimes driving, the payments market.",4,0.527,0.777,NEGATIVE

I mean they are used for just about every credit card transaction globally- prove me wrong?,"Good points. I wouldn’t accuse them of being stupid, maybe just a bit overconfident.

,First time poster LT lurker… Seems like visa and mc are no brainers for investing- just curious what others think about this. I mean they are used for just about every credit card transaction globally- prove me wrong?,"Yes that's absolutely correct. When using any of the above an underlying credit card is usually required.So firstly, we are now able to link our Google pay to our banking account. So we bypassed the credit card companies. China WeChat pay and alipay is the same. Not sure about applepay.Secondly, let's take alipay for example, other than your basic payment clearance/transfer, ant finance provides collatoral free loans, insurance, bonds, fixed deposits, wealth management etc....similar to banks but at much cheaper and competitive ratesLastly, baba and tencent has been investing heavily into online stock brokerages like tiger, webull and futu. Probably in hopes of incoperating them into their own app in the near future.So these fintech are going to be literally a one stop financial service app incoperating banking, investing, insurance, mortgage, foreign exchange, loans etc....all into one. There is plenty of room for growth and the apps are really sticky.I myself am a customer and I now split half my personal assets between traditional banks and fintech. I personally foresee myself transferring all my assets over to fintechs to manage in the next 5-10 years as I grow more and more accustomed to their offerings and my confidence with them will grow with time.The difference I see is that fintechs are versatile enough to aggressively move into credit card/ banks/brokerage territories, but do not see the old establishments being as aggressive vice versa.As the saying goes, sometimes it's not your closet competitor that unseats u, it might just be someone else outside the field.My two cents.",3,0.516,0.999,NEGATIVE
,First time poster LT lurker… Seems like visa and mc are no brainers for investing- just curious what others think about this. I mean they are used for just about every credit card transaction globally- prove me wrong?,You can of course link GooglePay directly to your bank account. But how do you think they handle transferring said money? Or paying at a POS or online?MC and Visa are fintech. They absolutely face competition on the core payments network but they have faced that before. I'm not saying that there aren't other great opportunities out there. I am saying that Visa and MC are going nowhere.,4,0.547,0.999,NEGATIVE
