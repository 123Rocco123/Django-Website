,"Warren Buffett has held AXP stock since the early 1990s. For a long time though, Amex was seen as too exclusive, since it wasn’t accepted as widely as Visa and MasterCard. That’s certainly changed in recent years as more places than ever now take Amex. Certainly, those loyal to Amex praise their customer service and benefits. Since June of 2023, AXP has shot up from 158 to 238. As of now, it’s still trading at a P/E of 19.6 (12.15 EPS). What makes it stand out, and what are the benefits and risks of AXP?",Amex is a true lender. You can open a checking or savings with Amex.Visa and MC do not issue lending - they facilitate payments with whomever you’re truly banking with.Amex is bigger risk/reward. However; they’re selective with credit scores and lending.,0,0.507,POSITIVE,0.994

What makes it stand out, and what are the benefits and risks of AXP?","Amex is both an issuer and acquirer. An issuer has the relationship with the card holder. For Visa and Mastercard, the banks that are part of those networks are the issuers. Issuers have the risk of default and have the income from either revolving credit on card balances and/or fees for the cards themselves and any ad-on services. Reward point programs are an expense (actually a liability on the books until realized, like grocery store coupons,) carried by issuers (so the member banks in Visa / MC network and Amex.) Amex is also an acquirer, meaning it has a direct relationship to merchants. Amex makes money from the discount fee that comes out of what Amex pays the merchant. Historically Amex has charged a higher discount fee than Visa/MC which has led to some dissatisfaction and card suppression by some merchants, mostly smaller, such as restaurants. I'm pretty sure big merchants, the Walmarts, Targets and Home Depots of the world negotiate a pretty favorable discount rate. Amex would tell you (as they tell the merchants,) that the typical Amex card member makes bigger $ amount purchases than the competition, justifying the higher discount rate.Visa / MC have some acquirer capability but also use acquirer companies that have a relationship with merchants. Amex also uses some of these companies. In the Amex presentations to Wall Street analysts they tout this issuer / acquirer capability under one roof as Amex's ""Closed Loop Model,"" and say it gives them a competitive insight into buying behavior and allows them to make more targeted offers to cardmembers. They also use this information to help merchants understand the total value of taking Amex card products and in some cases, have cooperative marketing efforts.Amex also calls their business model, ""Spend Centric."" Meaning they make money when cardmembers spend (because of the merchant discount,) but less from revolving credit because not that many of Amex's card products are balance carrying cards. Amex makes a distinction between a ""charge card"" where the balance is paid off each month and a ""credit card"" that carries a balance with interest charges. Amex has had a hit-or-miss approach to credit cards going back to the 80's and had been burned by credit lending multiple times.Amex treats customer service as a competitive advantage. They are very proud of things like JD Power awards and when they loose to another card company it's a big deal. Traditionally they have taken the side of the card member in disputes with merchants. Not something that always endears Amex with the merchant but tends to create loyal and enthusiastic card members.Amex had a venture into pre-paid cards for the ""unbanked"", hoping pre-paid would be a gateway for those customers to other, higher profit, card products which included a partnership with Walmart. As Amex discovered, the unbanked don't have any money and are unlikely to get some any time soon. That project was canceled.Amex is sensitive to interest rates. They have to pay the merchants long before they collect from the card members. To bridge that Amex relies on short-term borrowing. In the crisis of 2008, when credit markets froze following the collapse of Lehman Bros and Bear, Amex was not prepared with sufficient liquid reserves. If you can't pay your merchants they won't take your card and you are out of business. It was a very close thing. To avoid that ever happening again, after declaring themselves a bank and taking bail-out $, they expanded their banking operations with savings accounts and CD deposits. If you review any of their Wall Street presentations they talk about how many months (like a year+ last time I looked at one,) of liquidity they have available.Because of the Spend Centric model, Amex is sensitive to spending levels and charge volume. If people charge less, put off big ticket items, go out to eat less, travel less, that's a problem for Amex. Perhaps Visa / MC customers still use their cards to buy eggs and milk but even if the typical Amex customer does that, Amex doesn't have the volume of customers to make up for the reduced spending volume. So, consider that in light of the state of the economy.Amex has a ""spend centric"" model, uses reward points (Membership Rewards) to encourage spend and still tries to target the more affluent. I think this is what distinguishes them from Visa / MC and the member banks that rely on interest income from card balances. A greater proportion of Amex's customer base are affluent, charge larger amounts and have enough income to pay off their balances every month. They represent the upper crust, if you will, of whatever remains of the middle-class and above. Visa/MC are for ""everyman"" and ""everywoman"", not as far up the wealth pyramid if you will, smaller charges, carrying a balance, paying interest. But, there is a larger population of ""everypersons"" so Visa/MC make it up in quantity.It's a balancing act for Amex. There's a finite population, in my opinion, of the type of customer who are most profitable for them. They work to stay relevant and appeal to this population(so they keep spending,) while trying to find ways to expand and mine the niches of the right kind of customer, most notably, outside the US. It's an uphill battle outside the US because the merchants need to be there for new cardmembers, there are established card providers and reward providers everywhere already and, really, there's a limited population of people with the right level of income, wealth and spending habits outside the US.They also work to bring on new, younger, generations of the right kind of customer and not loose them to the competition as their existing base ages, retires and passes away.There's more to this story but that's enough for now.",1,0.524,POSITIVE,0.999

,"Warren Buffett has held AXP stock since the early 1990s. For a long time though, Amex was seen as too exclusive, since it wasn’t accepted as widely as Visa and MasterCard. That’s certainly changed in recent years as more places than ever now take Amex. Certainly, those loyal to Amex praise their customer service and benefits. Since June of 2023, AXP has shot up from 158 to 238. As of now, it’s still trading at a P/E of 19.6 (12.15 EPS). What makes it stand out, and what are the benefits and risks of AXP?","Agree. I actually used to be in Amex before I converted to index funds (+berkshire) and had a good cost basis of 120 but ended up selling (for a good gain) when I went all ETFs. Made money, can’t complain but wish I woulda held longer. At least with holding Berkshire in a way I do have AXP exposure.",4,0.518,POSITIVE,0.877

V is a 2.3b dollar position for them and V’s market cap is what…450b+? Pretty tiny compared to their 36b dollar Amex position. I’d bet money that he wishes now that he had the size in V as he does in Axp and I’m kinda baffled as to why he never bought more.,1,0.525,NEGATIVE,1.0

But they have wealthier clientele than many companies, and AXP, V, MA should all benefit from a ""no landing"" inflationary situation.
