,"it seems like a big part of starting out and learning is buying stocks based on speculation, since I don’t know tons of information and formulas yet. For example, MasterCard, it has a smaller market cap then VISA, can always bet on the American people’s spending habits, has room for growth, Is a company that does well in any economy, simple business model, great business overall, great competitive position. Is this speculation? I’m just starting out so when i start researching about a company it mostly consists of things like this. I look at great business that will be around for a long time and that will also continue to grow. Coca Cola, Microsoft, MasterCard, Rogers, Costco, etc Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I’m currently in university and like learning about investing in my spare time.","Well VISA is widely used outside of the US, that's why VISA is bigger. Here in Europe I can often pay with Visa but rarely with Mastercard. Sure you can speculate Mastercard will have a breakthrough outside of the US, but to be honest new competition like Apple Pay and Google Pay will probably succeed here.And regarding Coca Cola I give you some numbers:-1,63 -5,01 -5,31 -15,36 -9,49 17,59 -11,39That are the revenue changes each year for Coca Cola from 2014 to 2020. (calculated the company has now 13B$ less revenue last year than in the year 2014)What I want to say is for international companies you have to look international. A quick look on Wikipedia what the company does outside the US is often very helpful.And look at the financial results if you want to hold the stocks long term. A steady decline of revenue over several years can be a bad sign or how much debt the company has. (especially if you want companies that will be around for a long time like you say)If this is too much for you. Then just buy a world index ETF and you don't have to care about all this stuff.",0,0.573,0.781,POSITIVE

The rest is speculation derived from these things.If your analysis includes speculation but it’s based on evidence you’re going to do fine. Everyone makes their choices based partially on speculation, some more than others. Once you learn the numbers and formulas you’ll do even better. But chances are even your most well-researched decisions will go the other way once in a while because it’s impossible to predict the market with a perfect batting average.",0,0.518,0.996,NEGATIVE

You will do just as well buying companies that you feel good about and like.Best advice I can give you is if they are talking about it on Reddit, find another stock.",0,0.544,0.795,POSITIVE
