,"Too late to add more V and Pypl? I’m looking to double my position in these guys but am I smart to wait for a bit of a pullback? Both Visa and PayPal seem extremely over extended. Would I be smart just to stop overthinking it and jump in? I know time beats timing but these guys are at all time highs, or close to it.","If that's what you want to do, then add instead of doubling. 1% down on pypl today, might as well add.",0,0.539,0.756,NEGATIVE

Zoom out and look at their trajectory over 10+ years. It is consistently up every year regardless crash or what. So it is always at all times high. They have been raising their dividends by 20% because they can. And they jumped into crypto as well, so will not miss out on that.",0,0.545,0.999,POSITIVE

Most of their customers get exposure to them first through student loans (their original bread and butter) and if they have a good experience, odds are they will open a checking account with them, get a mortgage from them, and even trade stocks with them! Had a limit order for $20 that blew through it the other day....lol. Def buying more as it gets into mid/low teens.",1,0.526,0.512,POSITIVE

Obviously no one knows if there will be a drop in the next few months but I'm guessing you'll probably feel worse if PYPL is 30% higher in a few months rather than if it was 30% lower if you didn't add. Adding to my winners has performed well for me. If I were in your shoes I would add some now and then some more in a few weeks/next dip instead of straight doubling but to each their own",2,0.541,0.769,POSITIVE

I always grapple with this question and I ask myself - am I going to hold this for 10 -20 years or 1-2? Most of the time it's 10-20 for me so whether you buy $PYPL at $290 vs $250 (~10% pullback from current levels) will be negligible if it's at $1000 in 10 years. Yes, $PYPL and $V have had good run ups recently, but $PYPL hasn't hit a new 52 week high yet. If you have FOMO, buy half (or 2/3 or whatever) now and see if it makes a 52 week high or pulls back 10% and then buy the rest in either scenario. The reasoning being you are getting value with a pullback and probably won't see a better price with new 52 week highs being made. Or buy everything now and don't look at it for a year :D",0,0.556,0.871,NEGATIVE
