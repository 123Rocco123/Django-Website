,"https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/visa-stock-gains-as-quarterly-revenue-tops-7-billion-for-the-first-time-11643318848 “Visa Inc. topped $7 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, buoyed by a quicker-than-expected resumption in travel spending and sustained growth in categories like e-commerce that had been strong throughout the pandemic. The company generated fiscal first-quarter net income of $4.0 billion, or $1.83 a share, up from $3.1 billion, or $1.42 a share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, Visa V earned $1.81 a share. Analysts tracked by FactSet were expecting $1.70 in both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share. Visa’s revenue rose to $7.06 billion from $5.69 billion, while the FactSet consensus was for $6.79 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet weren’t expecting Visa to cross the $7 billion revenue mark until the June quarter. Payments volume rose 20%, while processed transactions increased 21%. The company saw a 51% increase in cross-border volume when excluding intra-Europe transactions and a 40% bump in overall cross-border volume.”",Just bought a few shares after hour. Up 5% doesn't seem like a bad deal on this news.Also I just watched the most recent South Park special and feel bullish on the legacy tech that apparently decentralized currencies are going to replace.Higher interest rates just makes it harder for startups to usurp visa.,0,0.526,1.0,NEGATIVE

I’m liquidateing this position to invest in Real Estate. Been selling 217.50 Calls for the last month and pocketed over $2k from it. Every week it’s above the strike price and then drops below it by Friday close. Thought the recovery to $217.50 would take longer than it has based on Monday but hoping it holds up at open.,1,0.526,0.998,NEGATIVE
