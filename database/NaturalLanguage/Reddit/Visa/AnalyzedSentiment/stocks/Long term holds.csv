,"Any opinions on Paypal and Visa on long term holds? I am looking to invest for the long run however I want to also know when the best time to buy is, we all know that we cannot time the market however do you guys feel like we're in a tech bubble waiting to burst? Just in need of a second opinion. Thank you.","I don't see Visa decaying. Maybe they will reach a theoretical limit to growth at which point they will likely be a solid dividend stock to hold.I've been told Mastercard has more international reach. But these companies make enormous amounts of money and likely always will, even if alternative financial companies have their day.",0,0.543,0.763,POSITIVE

I‚Äôve been a Visa stockholder for more than a decade and it‚Äôs treated me very well. I‚Äôve been slowly adding shares through this time and I‚Äôm not losing any sleep over short term volatility. Good entry point might come sub 200.,0,0.517,0.998,POSITIVE

That includes some elderly people who'd normally be pulling cash from the bank periodically for miscellaneous expenses. Visa filed an 8-K recently with the SEC, you may wish to look at that.I think that the current trend toward electronic payment is accelerating, although a lot of economic activity is quashed because of travel restrictions and unemployment.",0,0.511,0.874,NEGATIVE
