,"I have ~70% of my portfolio in Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft, Apple, and Bank of America. I'm always fighting with myself over whether to add more into my best stocks & average up OR to go for the dips like paypal/visa & wait for those to recover. All 5 have been fairly flat for perhaps over a month now. I don't have the cash to do both. I know it's okay to average up, but isn't it better to buy dips of other great companies?? That way you don't sacrifice your gain % on your best stocks, and you can scoop in larger gains from something in a dip than something that is already ATH. Or is that a wrong way to think about it?",It really depends what your bandwidth is… can you keep up with one or two more stocks and do the research?,0,0.536,0.983,NEGATIVE

Some of my biggest gains have been in companies I picked in the beginning that I don’t really love and I’m not sure if I should keep adding. They do say add to winners and cut losers but don’t really give you the time frame to assess. I gotta think at least a year, but it’s not like we’re living in typical times",0,0.531,0.984,NEGATIVE

Or is that a wrong way to think about it?","There are a lot of variables involved. Are you putting the cash into something short just to get a bounce, or trying to build up a longer-term position? Also, there's the matter of conviction about each choice--if you're confident the dip is temporary or not and if the larger position has more room to run or not.Averaging up works well when an investor sees that their initial call on a stock was incorrect and the assessment of fair value was too low--like you estimate a stock is worth $100 and then later realize it's worth $300 and may want to add up to $150. This assumes the investor is doing some kind of valuation measurement of some sort.",0,0.535,0.97,NEGATIVE

Dips are sort of the micro version of that theory but you do need to consider the macro as well.Right now the markets are making new highs. This is normal in a bull market but its also means your risk is high. That said, you dont need to sell or go all wako on fixed income, gold or whatever commodities and all that nonsense, but at the very least, diversify. Defend yourself a little bit.",0,0.56,0.973,NEGATIVE

Or is that a wrong way to think about it?","Slowly when the new highs start showing up, and speeding up the longer the bull market runs.Dont overthink things. The most obvious thing is usually correct. When a market starts to run (in either way) it usually means it will run a while so no need to get crazy early on. But as it moves along, you start to slowly deploy cash to defend yourself.So for me, I shifted about 5% of my portfolio this year,. I sold risky growth and moved to cash/div growth/value instead. It wasnt a huge shift (for my portfolio), but the market PE/fPE as well as low interest rates have me a little worried. Luckily, by doing so, I didnt get hurt by the dip in speculative stuff that has transpired since mid year. I am up about 50% on the year so far. That doesnt mean I sold anything I love (i didnt), but I sold anything that I felt was too risky and used that and any divs to diversify into more defensive stuff (or just cash).You can easily achieve this without picking stocks by just taking on some index etfs like BKLC (my personal favorite due to 0 fees), VOO, and some combo of VTI / VXUS. Small steps. Dont leap because like you said, its not easy to predict when the bull market will end.",2,0.544,1.0,NEGATIVE

Or is that a wrong way to think about it?","You shouldnt do things because you ""heard"" it. You will hear every opinion in every possible direction. You need to figure out the strategy you are happy with.Im currently 20% cash due to rising values in the other positions. Not too long ago I was around 25% cash but the rise in my growth positions dwarfed the cash very quickly.My goal is 25% so I am slowly accumulating cash again. If I buy anything its going to be cash generators (divs). My most recent pickup was a renewables/water utility.But none of this really helps you and thats my point. My strategies are likely very different than your own. For one thing, Im a very active investor and I spend a good 20 or more hours a week researching. I think its fun. I work from home (im technical at work right now) and I monitor my portfolio on my 4th screen all day. Its rare for anything to slip past me and I change my strategies very often. But the problem is whatever I say now, may not be what I am doing in a month from now...You need your own strategy. All I can say is that in the last 4-5 years I kept between 25% to 50% cash up until the COVID crash. I went in with 50% cash so as you can imagine, I made off really well. And thats the advantage of always having cash. But this only works if you are highly aware of the markets... what good is having cash if you dont know what to buy when the markets crash? See what I mean? For more hands off folks, you are better off plopping everything into a low fee ETF and calling it a day. If you are active, then always keep cash because there is always a deal to be had if you are actively researching.",4,0.523,1.0,NEGATIVE

Keeping in cash was how I got into Nvidia before the split - I have no cash right now to do anything if a correction did happen or another opportunity like Nvidia popped up. I need to shift out of bad investments like PINS, ARKG, and MSOS. But I would have to accept 30% loss in the latter 2 (PINS is speculation trade and only down 15% so willing to take the hit). It's really a tough tough call, but I should make it before I bleed more.",5,0.521,0.838,POSITIVE
