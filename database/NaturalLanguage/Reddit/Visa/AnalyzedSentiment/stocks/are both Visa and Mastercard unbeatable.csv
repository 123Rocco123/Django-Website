,"It seems that Visa/Mastercard has never had a bad year, and looking at the current market they seemingly have little to no competitors. Everyone uses their system to make payments, and investing in their shares gives better returns than most of the popular ETFs. What are you guy’s opinion regarding these 2? Would you consider them the heavyweights in the next 10-20 years?","and for the legitimate reasons you have stated, their valuations aren't low (30+ P/E). i would say that continued duopolisation is baked into their current valuations, but there's multiple reasons that duopoly could be disrupted (government regulation, fintech options, amex outperforms for whatever reason) I wouldn't be opposed to a 5-10% stake in these, though.",0,0.509,0.948,NEGATIVE

They get the data on purchases and get to wall garden consumers, but all of the Apple products are run by Goldman Sachs. The physical card they send you is a Mastercard.

Would you consider them the heavyweights in the next 10-20 years?","I go back and forth on this. In some ways the need for V and MA today seems redundant as these companies effectively just act as middlemen taxing consumer purchases. Both were useful for enabling digital transactions in a world before the internet and prior to the invention of digital currencies, but today all they do is extract value from economic activity while yielding monopolistic power over our transactions.In the coming years I wouldn't be surprised to see a continued push for tech that disrupts and works around the need for traditional payment processors. I also think you'll see some countries adopting digital currencies which will allow consumers and businesses to transfer funds to each other directly without the need for middlemen.Then again, given their size and influence it seems unlikely that this would happen in the West. I see them both as having solid moats as of right now, but I also don't understand the value these companies deliver to the consumer which makes me nervous to invest. I don't think anyone uses V or MA because they want to, we use these companies because we're forced to. As an investor that's great if you're happy to assume in the future consumers will continue to have no other options, but should that change it's not like anyone has any loyalty or love for their payment processor.Personally for a long-term hold I'd rather stick with a company like KO which has some loyalty and isn't at risk of technological disruption.",0,0.528,0.873,NEGATIVE

About 30 years ago the government forced the banks to create a non-profit digital transaction company with debit cards linked directly to your bank account.The Interac network.As a vendor I could process a transaction on visa for $1000 for about $16. On MC on average for around $18. And on AMEX for about $31.On interac that transaction costs the vendor 20c. Like, 98% cheaper. All are equally fast, equally accurate, and equally trusted.And yet, over the last 10 years Interac has LOST market share to visa and Mastercard in Canada. MC and Visa are monsters.LONG",2,0.542,0.822,NEGATIVE

Which technological disruptions exactly do you see to seriously threaten the present way we spend our money? Do you see yourself using some cryptoscheme of the week outside of hipster pizza shops or micro-nation states with funny economies? Do you think that Indian QR-system we only hear about on reddit now and then will become global anytime soon?On the contrary, in Germany as a major western example, credit cards (yes, exactly those soon-to-be-disrupted-dinosaurs) have yet to be adopted widely. It's a huge boomer economy where cash is king. Those few who aren't as stuck in their ways are using the national plastic money (""EC Karte"") but that's as digital as it gets. Visa and Mastercard are forcing Debit cards into the market now, but that's regularly met with heavy protest and bank clients who rather pay fees to keep their EC cards than use anything new. (Reminder that ""new"" means f*ckng Visa and Mastercard here. Yes, it's that bad.)In fact, so many shops here either still don't accept cards at all, or ""EC Karte"" only. So that golden age where some millenial is routinely walking into a shop without backup cash in the pocket, and just buys something using a Visa Debit in Google Pay without raising eyebrows behind the counter is yet to come in EU's biggest economy.So please tell me again and again how the V/MA duopoly is about to be replaced by anything. Meanwhile, I'll buy what I can out of those for at least the next 25 years. I don't know how many more Germany-type economies are out there in the world but their cash-regime will fall as the younger generations come around. And they won't be using anything else than what you are already expecting here.",2,0.518,0.99,NEGATIVE

The loyalty programs for consumers where you’ll get paid to use it. The disrupters have to solve this problem if they want to take on the giants like V and MA. Then convincing the banks who provide credits to the markets for both consumers and businesses who also get incentives to use either V and MA. The latter is a giant mountain to climb for any disruptor.,1,0.526,0.948,POSITIVE
