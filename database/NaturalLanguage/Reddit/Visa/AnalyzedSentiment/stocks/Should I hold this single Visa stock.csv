There’s really no downside in holding stock unless the value goes down. Unless you need the money right now I’d just leave it. Or if transfer it to another broker age bc fuck Robinhood.,0,0.525,0.999,NEGATIVE

Selling a stock within the first year =taxed as normal income if there are any gains. Selling it after that = taxed at a lower capital gains tax rate, which is depending on how mych you make but is between 0-20%. You might as well keep it and watch how it performs to help yourself learn more about the market. It’s fun plus it’s a couple hundred free dollars",0,0.542,0.769,NEGATIVE

You “have it” in your account, but Robinhood never actually gives you anything more than a little electronic illusion. Better to switch to a better broker and buy Visa shares yourself if interested, even fractional shares. Almost anything serious is better than Robinhood. You did say you’re “not an investing guy”, so you certainly feel free to watch it if you’re interested, but you should know that Robinhood has not actually given you (or whoever sent you a referral, for that matter) any actual value. It’s just a marketing trick.",0,0.516,1.0,NEGATIVE
