,"Why is Visa (V) is a better stock to buy than PayPal (PYPL) right now (This is also my first stock analysis so please leave some tips on what I can do better) I have recently many people comment on the recent sell of in PayPal and visa, PayPal being the more drastic dip. This recent dip makes people believe that PayPal is at a crazy discount right now and leads to a lot of retail investors btding. I believe with the information provided that visa is a much safer and better investment for consistent growth rather than PayPal. However, I believe that PayPal's recent sell-off was justified as the price did not meet the stock's performance and have been on a constant downtrend since the Pinterest debacle. Note I do own 7 Visa shares and 1 PayPal share. (Previously owned more PayPal but have been switching it around recently) Many people try to compare the usage of using Venmo compared to an older network of visa. However, when you look at Venmo as a p2p service for the younger community it controls about 57% market share filled with a lot of other fintech companies quickly growing rapidly. Like cash app gaining quickly on market share 180% increase in market share YOY. Now the same thing can be said about Visa, however, visa has the largest market share dominating the market. I’m thinking of it as a too big to fail type of company because who does not have a visa? Overall, the p2p service space that PayPal dominates is a way smaller total market size if you compare the processing sector of visa. Growth Visa has a 5-year CAGR of around 15.4%, while PayPal has a CAGR of 19.3% PayPal has been trading around a pe of 45 with a median pe for the last 10 years at 51.01 While visa has been trading 43 with a median pe ratio in the last 10 years at 32 Indicating a similar growth between the 2 companies. Dividend PayPal has no dividends currently VISA currently offers a 0.38$ dividend which has been increased in December by 17.19% from the previous year. Visa has a long history of dividend payments back from 2008 to today. They have been increasing dividends by about 15% YoY for the past 3 years. Margins Visa margins are very impressive and quite honestly a cash cow with net margins at 54%% roughly and have been hovering around that range for the past 10 years. Therefore, the recent news with amazon in the UK not accepting visa cards is irrelevant. They are very likely to sort some agreement for a cheaper transaction rate and Visa can afford to do that as they have incredible margins to do so. Visa credit cards also control about 80% of all credit cards in the UK likely causing a negative effect on both sides if this goes through. PayPal’s margins are sitting at a net of 17.58% which is also impressive but is substantially inferior to Visa’s. Concerns For me, the main concern is the integration of defi projects around the crypto space like LUNA, AVAX which can affect greatly on companies like Visa and PayPal. However, I think we are still years away from that being a significant factor. Overall, The growth rate for both companies has been great and somewhat similar, however with one company you get increased profit margins and dividends which are increased annually. PayPal’s management has also raised some serious concern after letting something like the Pinterest acquisition not to mention the insane amount of hate towards it from customers they literally have a sub for it lol. Overall if I were to compare these 2 at their current prices, I would rather put my money into Visa.","I suggest owning all 4. SQ, MA, V and PYPL.MA and V will keep growing and have a moat of the network they built. They can also acquire BNPL, Crypto, or any new tech.SQ has Point of Sales and merchant services that MA and V don't really do. Cash app will be a big financial app in time.PYPL has ecommerce market share. I run a shopify store and a lot of customers pay with PayPal.

Both broke 30% last year while MA and V were relatively flat. And the growth of fintech heavily impacts debit card companies and less so credit card companies, particularly the buy now pay later emergence.Again I do own them all and all 4 could have an excellent first half.

I believe with the information provided that visa is a much safer and better investment for consistent growth rather than PayPal. However, I believe that PayPal's recent sell-off was justified as the price did not meet the stock's performance and have been on a constant downtrend since the Pinterest debacle. Note I do own 7 Visa shares and 1 PayPal share. (Previously owned more PayPal but have been switching it around recently) Many people try to compare the usage of using Venmo compared to an older network of visa. However, when you look at Venmo as a p2p service for the younger community it controls about 57% market share filled with a lot of other fintech companies quickly growing rapidly. Like cash app gaining quickly on market share 180% increase in market share YOY. Now the same thing can be said about Visa, however, visa has the largest market share dominating the market. I’m thinking of it as a too big to fail type of company because who does not have a visa? Overall, the p2p service space that PayPal dominates is a way smaller total market size if you compare the processing sector of visa. Growth Visa has a 5-year CAGR of around 15.4%, while PayPal has a CAGR of 19.3% PayPal has been trading around a pe of 45 with a median pe for the last 10 years at 51.01 While visa has been trading 43 with a median pe ratio in the last 10 years at 32 Indicating a similar growth between the 2 companies. Dividend PayPal has no dividends currently VISA currently offers a 0.38$ dividend which has been increased in December by 17.19% from the previous year. Visa has a long history of dividend payments back from 2008 to today. They have been increasing dividends by about 15% YoY for the past 3 years. Margins Visa margins are very impressive and quite honestly a cash cow with net margins at 54%% roughly and have been hovering around that range for the past 10 years. Therefore, the recent news with amazon in the UK not accepting visa cards is irrelevant. They are very likely to sort some agreement for a cheaper transaction rate and Visa can afford to do that as they have incredible margins to do so. Visa credit cards also control about 80% of all credit cards in the UK likely causing a negative effect on both sides if this goes through. PayPal’s margins are sitting at a net of 17.58% which is also impressive but is substantially inferior to Visa’s. Concerns For me, the main concern is the integration of defi projects around the crypto space like LUNA, AVAX which can affect greatly on companies like Visa and PayPal. However, I think we are still years away from that being a significant factor. Overall, The growth rate for both companies has been great and somewhat similar, however with one company you get increased profit margins and dividends which are increased annually. PayPal’s management has also raised some serious concern after letting something like the Pinterest acquisition not to mention the insane amount of hate towards it from customers they literally have a sub for it lol. Overall if I were to compare these 2 at their current prices, I would rather put my money into Visa.","You think Venmo is more known than Visa?I mean, there is such a thing as an opinion, and then there is just being flat out incorrect. I'm not making a value judgement on either stock, but you can't claim Venmo is more known than Visa. Life doesn't work that way. Also, Venmo exists on top of existing payment infrastructure, Visa IS payment infrastructure.Realistically, a merchant can't even accept digital payment without accepting Visa.

I believe with the information provided that visa is a much safer and better investment for consistent growth rather than PayPal. However, I believe that PayPal's recent sell-off was justified as the price did not meet the stock's performance and have been on a constant downtrend since the Pinterest debacle. Note I do own 7 Visa shares and 1 PayPal share. (Previously owned more PayPal but have been switching it around recently) Many people try to compare the usage of using Venmo compared to an older network of visa. However, when you look at Venmo as a p2p service for the younger community it controls about 57% market share filled with a lot of other fintech companies quickly growing rapidly. Like cash app gaining quickly on market share 180% increase in market share YOY. Now the same thing can be said about Visa, however, visa has the largest market share dominating the market. I’m thinking of it as a too big to fail type of company because who does not have a visa? Overall, the p2p service space that PayPal dominates is a way smaller total market size if you compare the processing sector of visa. Growth Visa has a 5-year CAGR of around 15.4%, while PayPal has a CAGR of 19.3% PayPal has been trading around a pe of 45 with a median pe for the last 10 years at 51.01 While visa has been trading 43 with a median pe ratio in the last 10 years at 32 Indicating a similar growth between the 2 companies. Dividend PayPal has no dividends currently VISA currently offers a 0.38$ dividend which has been increased in December by 17.19% from the previous year. Visa has a long history of dividend payments back from 2008 to today. They have been increasing dividends by about 15% YoY for the past 3 years. Margins Visa margins are very impressive and quite honestly a cash cow with net margins at 54%% roughly and have been hovering around that range for the past 10 years. Therefore, the recent news with amazon in the UK not accepting visa cards is irrelevant. They are very likely to sort some agreement for a cheaper transaction rate and Visa can afford to do that as they have incredible margins to do so. Visa credit cards also control about 80% of all credit cards in the UK likely causing a negative effect on both sides if this goes through. PayPal’s margins are sitting at a net of 17.58% which is also impressive but is substantially inferior to Visa’s. Concerns For me, the main concern is the integration of defi projects around the crypto space like LUNA, AVAX which can affect greatly on companies like Visa and PayPal. However, I think we are still years away from that being a significant factor. Overall, The growth rate for both companies has been great and somewhat similar, however with one company you get increased profit margins and dividends which are increased annually. PayPal’s management has also raised some serious concern after letting something like the Pinterest acquisition not to mention the insane amount of hate towards it from customers they literally have a sub for it lol. Overall if I were to compare these 2 at their current prices, I would rather put my money into Visa.","I might be out of the loop but I have no clue what Venmo does. All I know is I have a few visa credit cards, I see visa commercials, I see the visa brand on sports arenas, heck even Morgan Freeman used to narrate the commercials. Brand pays in the long run and will exist forever there's a reason why companies spend so much on advertising.",2,0.514,0.982,POSITIVE

Dividend PayPal has no dividends currently VISA currently offers a 0.38$ dividend which has been increased in December by 17.19% from the previous year.

A market share increase from 05% to 1.4% still incidates a 180% move, but would not be a statistically significant reason for anyone to change their perception. If it's a metric you want to share, validate it's importance by including the hard numbers or linking to a source.Now the same thing can be said about Visa, however, visa has the largest market share dominating the market. I’m thinking of it as a too big to fail type of company because who does not have a visa?I mean no disrespect, but if this is your first analysis, your gut instinct carries no weight. You need to prove why Visa is a ""too big to fail"" company. Also ""too big to fail"" does not mean ""good investment"". The auto makers were ""too big to fail"" during the financial crisis of the late 2000s, so using that phrase is going to create an inherent distrust of your assessment from the vast majority of readers who were active in the market at that time. Many were not a fan of how much assistance was thrown to them and don't want to be tied to a company that anyone thinks could need such treatment in the future.Overall, the p2p service space that PayPal dominates is a way smaller total market size if you compare the processing sector of visa.This is true, but the whole reason people invest in PayPal is because the gap between these two sectors is shrinking. PayPal isn't eating all of the market-share, but they're the biggest fish in a school that IS. ERa show their business model works and is growing and that can't be ignored, even if the pace is slowing down.It hurts your case to tout the market-share increase of Cash App as a legitimate threat to PayPal's business and then completely dismiss the fact that PayPal (and their contemporaries) is doing the exact same thing to V. It's not happening as fast, but it is happening. (For the record, I also believe it will plateau at some point but, again, it's your job to find the evidence to prove that and present it to your audience).GrowthVisa has a 5-year CAGR of around 15.4%, while PayPal has a CAGR of 19.3%PayPal has been trading around a pe of 45 with a median pe for the last 10 years at 51.01While visa has been trading 43 with a median pe ratio in the last 10 years at 32Indicating a similar growth between the 2 companies.Smart move here, acknowledge a big reason why they're tied to each other, being willing to admit some justification for the toss up between the two is good for your credibility to the reader.DividendPayPal has no dividends currentlyVISA currently offers a 0.38$ dividend which has been increased in December by 17.19% from the previous year.

This recent dip makes people believe that PayPal is at a crazy discount right now and leads to a lot of retail investors btding. I believe with the information provided that visa is a much safer and better investment for consistent growth rather than PayPal. However, I believe that PayPal's recent sell-off was justified as the price did not meet the stock's performance and have been on a constant downtrend since the Pinterest debacle. Note I do own 7 Visa shares and 1 PayPal share. (Previously owned more PayPal but have been switching it around recently) Many people try to compare the usage of using Venmo compared to an older network of visa. However, when you look at Venmo as a p2p service for the younger community it controls about 57% market share filled with a lot of other fintech companies quickly growing rapidly. Like cash app gaining quickly on market share 180% increase in market share YOY. Now the same thing can be said about Visa, however, visa has the largest market share dominating the market. I’m thinking of it as a too big to fail type of company because who does not have a visa? Overall, the p2p service space that PayPal dominates is a way smaller total market size if you compare the processing sector of visa. Growth Visa has a 5-year CAGR of around 15.4%, while PayPal has a CAGR of 19.3% PayPal has been trading around a pe of 45 with a median pe for the last 10 years at 51.01 While visa has been trading 43 with a median pe ratio in the last 10 years at 32 Indicating a similar growth between the 2 companies. Dividend PayPal has no dividends currently VISA currently offers a 0.38$ dividend which has been increased in December by 17.19% from the previous year. Visa has a long history of dividend payments back from 2008 to today. They have been increasing dividends by about 15% YoY for the past 3 years. Margins Visa margins are very impressive and quite honestly a cash cow with net margins at 54%% roughly and have been hovering around that range for the past 10 years. Therefore, the recent news with amazon in the UK not accepting visa cards is irrelevant. They are very likely to sort some agreement for a cheaper transaction rate and Visa can afford to do that as they have incredible margins to do so. Visa credit cards also control about 80% of all credit cards in the UK likely causing a negative effect on both sides if this goes through. PayPal’s margins are sitting at a net of 17.58% which is also impressive but is substantially inferior to Visa’s. Concerns For me, the main concern is the integration of defi projects around the crypto space like LUNA, AVAX which can affect greatly on companies like Visa and PayPal. However, I think we are still years away from that being a significant factor. Overall, The growth rate for both companies has been great and somewhat similar, however with one company you get increased profit margins and dividends which are increased annually. PayPal’s management has also raised some serious concern after letting something like the Pinterest acquisition not to mention the insane amount of hate towards it from customers they literally have a sub for it lol.

Dividend PayPal has no dividends currently VISA currently offers a 0.38$ dividend which has been increased in December by 17.19% from the previous year.

Therefore, the recent news with amazon in the UK not accepting visa cards is irrelevant. They are very likely to sort some agreement for a cheaper transaction rate and Visa can afford to do that as they have incredible margins to do so. Visa credit cards also control about 80% of all credit cards in the UK likely causing a negative effect on both sides if this goes through. PayPal’s margins are sitting at a net of 17.58% which is also impressive but is substantially inferior to Visa’s. Concerns For me, the main concern is the integration of defi projects around the crypto space like LUNA, AVAX which can affect greatly on companies like Visa and PayPal. However, I think we are still years away from that being a significant factor. Overall, The growth rate for both companies has been great and somewhat similar, however with one company you get increased profit margins and dividends which are increased annually.

Visa has a long history of dividend payments back from 2008 to today. They have been increasing dividends by about 15% YoY for the past 3 years. Margins Visa margins are very impressive and quite honestly a cash cow with net margins at 54%% roughly and have been hovering around that range for the past 10 years. Therefore, the recent news with amazon in the UK not accepting visa cards is irrelevant. They are very likely to sort some agreement for a cheaper transaction rate and Visa can afford to do that as they have incredible margins to do so. Visa credit cards also control about 80% of all credit cards in the UK likely causing a negative effect on both sides if this goes through. PayPal’s margins are sitting at a net of 17.58% which is also impressive but is substantially inferior to Visa’s. Concerns For me, the main concern is the integration of defi projects around the crypto space like LUNA, AVAX which can affect greatly on companies like Visa and PayPal. However, I think we are still years away from that being a significant factor. Overall, The growth rate for both companies has been great and somewhat similar, however with one company you get increased profit margins and dividends which are increased annually. PayPal’s management has also raised some serious concern after letting something like the Pinterest acquisition not to mention the insane amount of hate towards it from customers they literally have a sub for it lol. Overall if I were to compare these 2 at their current prices, I would rather put my money into Visa.","Apple Pay? Samsung Pay?There will always be a middle man.

,"Why is Visa (V) is a better stock to buy than PayPal (PYPL) right now (This is also my first stock analysis so please leave some tips on what I can do better) I have recently many people comment on the recent sell of in PayPal and visa, PayPal being the more drastic dip. This recent dip makes people believe that PayPal is at a crazy discount right now and leads to a lot of retail investors btding. I believe with the information provided that visa is a much safer and better investment for consistent growth rather than PayPal. However, I believe that PayPal's recent sell-off was justified as the price did not meet the stock's performance and have been on a constant downtrend since the Pinterest debacle.

Also retailers are pushing for competition. As you have probably noticed, Amazon and Costco both hate the credit card companies for their fees. Amazon has already let Paypal in.
