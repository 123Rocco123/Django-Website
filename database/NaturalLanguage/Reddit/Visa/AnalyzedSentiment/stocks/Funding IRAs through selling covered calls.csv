,"I left a job last year and rolled over both my Traditional & Roth IRAs. I’ve since bought Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Visa, Norvo Nordisk (NVO) stocks (among others) and have been able to write covered calls averaging about $300 a week in premium. I look for CCs with at least one standard deviation from the current price or 85% likelihood of profit with a ~.2 Delta. I then buy 1-3 stock shares per week with the premium. I’ve had a couple of CCs redeemed and I usually just re-buy the same stock and sell new CCs. Is this a viable strategy long term?","True. I’m OK with buying 90 shares, for example, and adding 10 shares back over time to write CCs again if I like the stock enough.",0,0.538,0.741,POSITIVE

Is this a viable strategy long term?","As long as the strike is at a price where you would be comfortable selling your position, I think CC's are hard to argue against. Traditionally your enemy is taxes but in an IRA that is irrelevant.I also really don't see a reason not to write very far otm CCs on your heavier positions if you're at all concerned with the capped upside that others on this post have highlighted. I look at something like NVDA where an EOM 350C is $60 as a good example of this. Seems like free money to me.Cash secured puts, which are more or less the inverse of a covered call, could also be worth looking into for you. They require some more meticulous planning as you really need to be comfortable with the entry price should you get exercised but if you're using the amount of cash required to make strategies like this worthwhile there is no excuse for not doing your homework.",0,0.518,0.834,NEGATIVE

Though it’s a struggle because it recently went just above my strike price of $165. However, with the seesaw nature of the market this year, it will likely be fine in time. In a more bullish market I would sell even .15 delta or lower. It’s often compared to picking up pennies in front of a steam roller. However, getting “crushed” with blue chip stock usually looks like capping your gain and selling CSEPs until it corrects back down, which could be next week, I could be never…",0,0.542,0.587,POSITIVE
