A few big things stick out to me:An eroding balance sheet - They once had zero long term debt just 5 years ago, now they have more long term debt than cash on hand. And yet the stock is down 31% in that time period, so whatever they did with all that debt they took on hasn't helped the shareholders.Their free cash flow has been very stagnant for a number of years now, if not slightly declining.Stock Based Compensation is eating up 35% of their free cash flow. Not the worse compared to other big tech companies, and it at least hasn't been exploding in more recent years, but it makes the above point even worse since SBC is essentially an expense to the shareholders that doesn't show up as an expense on the balance sheet in the free cash flow.And besides that, I'm just plain skeptical that Paypal can continue growing like they have in the past given all the new competition in the space. And IMO I don't see their stablecoin offering going all that well for them given how other stablecoins have blown up, and how the government is starting to crack down on crypto.",1,0.54,NEGATIVE,1.0

The debt is an asset in some sense as their senior notes have fixed interest payments of between 1.9%-5.2%, this is lower than treasuries at the moment so their net interest income is actually positive. It grew 30% over the previous years. If PayPal wanted to, they could repurchase the debt at a significant discount for par.They took a 400 million hit to cash flow this year due some tax expenses related to restructuring and IP rights transfers in the first quarter. Excluding that, cash flow should be higher than last year.The SBC expense is distorted due to accounting measures. SBC gets accounted for at the time of issuance, so the average outstanding price of SBC is 130 per share I believe. Since PayPal is repurchasing shares, at today’s market price, the accounting SBC distorts the actual hit to cash flow by over 100%. You can double check what I’m saying by looking at the share repurchases that occurred in the prior quarter, a repurchase of 22 million shares vs an issuance of 2 million.There are some causes for concern in PayPal’s business but the balance sheet is not one of them. It’s pretty much a fortress.",2,0.554,NEGATIVE,1.0

They have their PayPal payments service. They also offer buy now pay later services as well as other financial services.They kinda take the Adobe approach to online payments in my opinion. They have a fairly diversified set of products and services, non of which are particularly loved but they have the financials to do deals both with smaller and larger businesses and when they need to historically they've made smart acquisitions.PayPal is cheap right now, largely trading on fear that they've have a lack of strategy and they is a lot of new competition in the spaces they operate.

It has the makings of a value trap that you can see develop into in real time. To me, PYPL is an experiment where I can test my research and my ability to do qualitative research with a minor focus on quantitive research. I want to keep watching this story play out. I want to see if my thesis is correct that PYPL will fall into obscurity in 10 years.The shortfall of investors here and even a some CFA’s and MBA’s I’ve worked with is the fact that they are too quant focused. This is their downfall and they couldn’t catch why PYPL wasn’t gonna go to $500+ just like now they can’t catch why PYPL is still sinking. No doubt, PYPL is cheap here and could see a sizable bounce in the short term just as it had previously.I will say that some of PYPL company’s recent moves have been good. They eliminated the duration risk by not being a bank, but rather, by sticking to their tried and true business: to be a toll road of payments. If they continue this, they should be able to keep the gravy train going. The question is, for how long? That is the main bull and bear thesis.If you are long PYPL, good luck.
