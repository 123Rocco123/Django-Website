,"Obviously these companies are huge, and have become a part of the way we live, but they also come with huge valuations. Are these still considered relatively safe to put your money compared to the rest of the market? I guess it boils down to what is safe measured by, the assets/debt, the moat, the P/E or P/S, or some combination of a bunch of factors? Is there even a way to measure such a thing?","Nothing is ever completely safe, but those should be lower risk.Typical blue chips include KO, PEP, JNJ, etc",0,0.492,0.5,POSITIVE

Although you can make an argument that apple is too reliant on the iPhone so if someone invents another game changing phone it probably wonâ€™t be safe anymore. And likewise someone can come up with a new payment system and visa wonâ€™t be safe anymore,0,0.523,0.963,NEGATIVE

What you pay relative to the cash flows an asset will produce is what determines its risk. There is no such thing as a safe stock irrespective of price.,0,0.573,0.933,NEGATIVE
