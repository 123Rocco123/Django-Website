These questions have been answered on this sub and others ad nauseam and there is no longer any reason to ask people to educate you when all of the info is out there in various forms across books, YouTube videos, online courses, and LLMs like ChatGPT. Sorry to be a dick. But you just seem like you’re bumbling into a casino and yelling “how do I put it all on black at the high roller table and if the roulette wheel lands on green do I still win?” Truly regarded, as you have yourself acknowledged. Don’t waste other people’s time educating you when there are countless resources to educate yourself. But hey maybe someone else will be nicer and more patient than I am. Good luck in your efforts.",1,0.507,NEGATIVE,0.994
