,"Hello everybody, I started investing in a moment, which was very unusual. It was April 2020. No matter what I bought, it soared almost 100% in just a few weeks. Now, being relatively new to investing, the last 3-4 weeks of volatility changed my newcomer mindset from „buy, keep for a few days, sell with profit“ to „choose carefully“. As we all found out, a lot of the overhyped companies are or were massively overvalued, as the current correction is showing us. Therefore I want to „repair“ my portfolio and concentrate only on good, healthy long-term growth stocks, which can survive the test of time. In my process of researching, I have 6 favorites so far: SQUARE, PAYPAL, MASTERCARD, VISA, SHOPIFY, AMAZON. What do you think about them and what would you choose? Thank you for your valuable input.","The companies you've mentioned are not undervalued by any financial metrics.Berkshire Hathaway is a good example of a stock that is constantly undervalued. As the tangible book value of its holdings grows, Berkshire's market price grows accordingly... consequently it's almost always a buy at any point in time.That's the kind of companies you should be looking for, but it's also important to realistically assess whether you have the knowledge, capacity and discipline to actively manage your own portfolio or are better off leaving that task to the expertise of others.No matter what list of stocks anyone gives you, it won't teach you how to evaluate businesses. But the beautiful thing is, you don't have to. There are index funds/ETFs like VOO and others whose compounded annual growth will meet most of your financial goals over time... and you can go about your business doing other things, and not losing sleep over money.",0,0.543,0.997,POSITIVE

The company has about $10 billion of cash net of debt, which translates to ~$10.50 per share. The projected earnings for this year translate to $3.87 per ADR. That's 18.5 P/E, but if you subtract out the cash, the P/E is only 15.8. Which is pretty good for this market.They have tons of growth opportunities: they have barely scratched the surface in the Chinese Market; the new Switch coming out with the better screen at the end of the year is a big upgrade in that it will be able to output 4K* (*allegedly according to a Bloomberg report); they are seeing a lot of sales going to homes that already own one switch but want a second one; 3 new Pokemon games coming out in the next two years, including an open world one that looks awesome; Zelda breath of the Wild 2 is massively hyped and will kill if they keep it up to the standards of the first game; so many classic game re-releases that seem like easy profits; stimulus checks are coming in the US.Disclosure: I own NTDOY in a retirement account as a long-term hold. I am thinking about buying some more in my main account, but looking for the right entry point. I know ARKK has been selling NTDOY for the last few days so that might drive the price down some more in the short term.edit: the 4K output switch is a rumor at this stage not confirmed.",0,0.557,1.0,NEGATIVE
