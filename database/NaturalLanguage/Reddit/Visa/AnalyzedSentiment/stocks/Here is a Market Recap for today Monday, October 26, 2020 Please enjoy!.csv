,"PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 26, 2020 Losses in the stock market accelerated today as new data showed an increased number of coronavirus infections in both Europe and the United States. In an effort to combat the disease, countries are once again putting restrictions in place, raising the concern of another lockdown that further harms global economic activity. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished the day down 1.82%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.5% down and the Dow Jones performed the worst (DIA) finishing 2.21%. Unfortunately, over the weekend, the US posted consecutive days of record high infection, with more than 80,000 new cases confirmed on Friday and Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. States in the Midwest of the US have been the most affected, most likely due to a resistance by the population to wear masks and colder temperatures.. Over the past seven days, the country reported an average of about 68,767 new cases every day, the highest seven-day average recorded yet, again according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Worryingly, The seven-day average is up more than 22% compared to last week, an extremely worrying increase. Adjusted for population, the Dakotas, Wisconsin, Montana and Idaho are reporting more average daily new cases than anywhere else in the country. Sadly, Johns Hopkins University reported there were 225,111 COVID-19 related deaths across the country as of Sunday afternoon. By comparison, there were 291,557 American soldiers killed in battle during World War II, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Europe is faring no better, with countries reporting a record number of infections over the weekend and announcing a host of new restrictions. On Sunday, France reported 52,000 positive cases, a record for the country. In response, two-thirds of the country has been placed under strict, 9 p.m. curfew. In Italy, 15,199 new cases of the virus were reported, well above the previous record of 11,705. In response, the Italian government has implemented restrictions, shutting down gyms, pools and movie theaters, putting an early curfew on cafes and restaurants and mandating that people keep wearing masks outdoors. Spain, which has also been struggling with a record number of infections, declared a nationwide state of emergency and imposed a curfew. With the November election a mere 8 days away, the chances for the passage of additional virus-relief have all but disappeared. In a letter to her fellow Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed the Republicans for the failure to act in the face of the pandemic, calling their response “arrogance”. She said, “The Republicans’ continued surrender to the virus - particularly amid the recent wave cases - is official malfeasance. We must come to an agreement as soon as possible. But we cannot accept the [Trump] administration’s refusal to crush the virus, honor our heroes or put money in the pockets of the American people. That attitude clearly explains why the White House has not embraced the science-based path to crush the virus, which is contained in the Heroes Act.” Democrats and the White House have most recently proposed $2.2 trillion and $1.9 trillion relief packages, respectively. Despite the similar target price tags for legislation, the sides still have not resolved disputes over testing, extra unemployment insurance, state and local government relief and liability protections for businesses, among other issues.

The S&P 500 (SPY) finished the day down 1.82%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.5% down and the Dow Jones performed the worst (DIA) finishing 2.21%. Unfortunately, over the weekend, the US posted consecutive days of record high infection, with more than 80,000 new cases confirmed on Friday and Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. States in the Midwest of the US have been the most affected, most likely due to a resistance by the population to wear masks and colder temperatures.. Over the past seven days, the country reported an average of about 68,767 new cases every day, the highest seven-day average recorded yet, again according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Worryingly, The seven-day average is up more than 22% compared to last week, an extremely worrying increase. Adjusted for population, the Dakotas, Wisconsin, Montana and Idaho are reporting more average daily new cases than anywhere else in the country. Sadly, Johns Hopkins University reported there were 225,111 COVID-19 related deaths across the country as of Sunday afternoon. By comparison, there were 291,557 American soldiers killed in battle during World War II, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Europe is faring no better, with countries reporting a record number of infections over the weekend and announcing a host of new restrictions. On Sunday, France reported 52,000 positive cases, a record for the country. In response, two-thirds of the country has been placed under strict, 9 p.m. curfew. In Italy, 15,199 new cases of the virus were reported, well above the previous record of 11,705. In response, the Italian government has implemented restrictions, shutting down gyms, pools and movie theaters, putting an early curfew on cafes and restaurants and mandating that people keep wearing masks outdoors. Spain, which has also been struggling with a record number of infections, declared a nationwide state of emergency and imposed a curfew. With the November election a mere 8 days away, the chances for the passage of additional virus-relief have all but disappeared. In a letter to her fellow Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed the Republicans for the failure to act in the face of the pandemic, calling their response “arrogance”. She said, “The Republicans’ continued surrender to the virus - particularly amid the recent wave cases - is official malfeasance. We must come to an agreement as soon as possible. But we cannot accept the [Trump] administration’s refusal to crush the virus, honor our heroes or put money in the pockets of the American people. That attitude clearly explains why the White House has not embraced the science-based path to crush the virus, which is contained in the Heroes Act.” Democrats and the White House have most recently proposed $2.2 trillion and $1.9 trillion relief packages, respectively. Despite the similar target price tags for legislation, the sides still have not resolved disputes over testing, extra unemployment insurance, state and local government relief and liability protections for businesses, among other issues.

In an effort to combat the disease, countries are once again putting restrictions in place, raising the concern of another lockdown that further harms global economic activity. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished the day down 1.82%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.5% down and the Dow Jones performed the worst (DIA) finishing 2.21%. Unfortunately, over the weekend, the US posted consecutive days of record high infection, with more than 80,000 new cases confirmed on Friday and Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. States in the Midwest of the US have been the most affected, most likely due to a resistance by the population to wear masks and colder temperatures.. Over the past seven days, the country reported an average of about 68,767 new cases every day, the highest seven-day average recorded yet, again according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Worryingly, The seven-day average is up more than 22% compared to last week, an extremely worrying increase. Adjusted for population, the Dakotas, Wisconsin, Montana and Idaho are reporting more average daily new cases than anywhere else in the country. Sadly, Johns Hopkins University reported there were 225,111 COVID-19 related deaths across the country as of Sunday afternoon. By comparison, there were 291,557 American soldiers killed in battle during World War II, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Europe is faring no better, with countries reporting a record number of infections over the weekend and announcing a host of new restrictions. On Sunday, France reported 52,000 positive cases, a record for the country. In response, two-thirds of the country has been placed under strict, 9 p.m. curfew. In Italy, 15,199 new cases of the virus were reported, well above the previous record of 11,705. In response, the Italian government has implemented restrictions, shutting down gyms, pools and movie theaters, putting an early curfew on cafes and restaurants and mandating that people keep wearing masks outdoors. Spain, which has also been struggling with a record number of infections, declared a nationwide state of emergency and imposed a curfew. With the November election a mere 8 days away, the chances for the passage of additional virus-relief have all but disappeared. In a letter to her fellow Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed the Republicans for the failure to act in the face of the pandemic, calling their response “arrogance”. She said, “The Republicans’ continued surrender to the virus - particularly amid the recent wave cases - is official malfeasance. We must come to an agreement as soon as possible. But we cannot accept the [Trump] administration’s refusal to crush the virus, honor our heroes or put money in the pockets of the American people. That attitude clearly explains why the White House has not embraced the science-based path to crush the virus, which is contained in the Heroes Act.” Democrats and the White House have most recently proposed $2.2 trillion and $1.9 trillion relief packages, respectively. Despite the similar target price tags for legislation, the sides still have not resolved disputes over testing, extra unemployment insurance, state and local government relief and liability protections for businesses, among other issues.

,"PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 26, 2020 Losses in the stock market accelerated today as new data showed an increased number of coronavirus infections in both Europe and the United States. In an effort to combat the disease, countries are once again putting restrictions in place, raising the concern of another lockdown that further harms global economic activity. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished the day down 1.82%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.5% down and the Dow Jones performed the worst (DIA) finishing 2.21%. Unfortunately, over the weekend, the US posted consecutive days of record high infection, with more than 80,000 new cases confirmed on Friday and Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. States in the Midwest of the US have been the most affected, most likely due to a resistance by the population to wear masks and colder temperatures.. Over the past seven days, the country reported an average of about 68,767 new cases every day, the highest seven-day average recorded yet, again according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Worryingly, The seven-day average is up more than 22% compared to last week, an extremely worrying increase. Adjusted for population, the Dakotas, Wisconsin, Montana and Idaho are reporting more average daily new cases than anywhere else in the country. Sadly, Johns Hopkins University reported there were 225,111 COVID-19 related deaths across the country as of Sunday afternoon. By comparison, there were 291,557 American soldiers killed in battle during World War II, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Europe is faring no better, with countries reporting a record number of infections over the weekend and announcing a host of new restrictions. On Sunday, France reported 52,000 positive cases, a record for the country. In response, two-thirds of the country has been placed under strict, 9 p.m. curfew. In Italy, 15,199 new cases of the virus were reported, well above the previous record of 11,705. In response, the Italian government has implemented restrictions, shutting down gyms, pools and movie theaters, putting an early curfew on cafes and restaurants and mandating that people keep wearing masks outdoors. Spain, which has also been struggling with a record number of infections, declared a nationwide state of emergency and imposed a curfew. With the November election a mere 8 days away, the chances for the passage of additional virus-relief have all but disappeared. In a letter to her fellow Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed the Republicans for the failure to act in the face of the pandemic, calling their response “arrogance”. She said, “The Republicans’ continued surrender to the virus - particularly amid the recent wave cases - is official malfeasance. We must come to an agreement as soon as possible. But we cannot accept the [Trump] administration’s refusal to crush the virus, honor our heroes or put money in the pockets of the American people. That attitude clearly explains why the White House has not embraced the science-based path to crush the virus, which is contained in the Heroes Act.” Democrats and the White House have most recently proposed $2.2 trillion and $1.9 trillion relief packages, respectively.

,"PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 26, 2020 Losses in the stock market accelerated today as new data showed an increased number of coronavirus infections in both Europe and the United States. In an effort to combat the disease, countries are once again putting restrictions in place, raising the concern of another lockdown that further harms global economic activity. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished the day down 1.82%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.5% down and the Dow Jones performed the worst (DIA) finishing 2.21%. Unfortunately, over the weekend, the US posted consecutive days of record high infection, with more than 80,000 new cases confirmed on Friday and Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. States in the Midwest of the US have been the most affected, most likely due to a resistance by the population to wear masks and colder temperatures.. Over the past seven days, the country reported an average of about 68,767 new cases every day, the highest seven-day average recorded yet, again according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Worryingly, The seven-day average is up more than 22% compared to last week, an extremely worrying increase. Adjusted for population, the Dakotas, Wisconsin, Montana and Idaho are reporting more average daily new cases than anywhere else in the country. Sadly, Johns Hopkins University reported there were 225,111 COVID-19 related deaths across the country as of Sunday afternoon. By comparison, there were 291,557 American soldiers killed in battle during World War II, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Europe is faring no better, with countries reporting a record number of infections over the weekend and announcing a host of new restrictions. On Sunday, France reported 52,000 positive cases, a record for the country. In response, two-thirds of the country has been placed under strict, 9 p.m. curfew. In Italy, 15,199 new cases of the virus were reported, well above the previous record of 11,705. In response, the Italian government has implemented restrictions, shutting down gyms, pools and movie theaters, putting an early curfew on cafes and restaurants and mandating that people keep wearing masks outdoors. Spain, which has also been struggling with a record number of infections, declared a nationwide state of emergency and imposed a curfew. With the November election a mere 8 days away, the chances for the passage of additional virus-relief have all but disappeared. In a letter to her fellow Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed the Republicans for the failure to act in the face of the pandemic, calling their response “arrogance”. She said, “The Republicans’ continued surrender to the virus - particularly amid the recent wave cases - is official malfeasance. We must come to an agreement as soon as possible. But we cannot accept the [Trump] administration’s refusal to crush the virus, honor our heroes or put money in the pockets of the American people. That attitude clearly explains why the White House has not embraced the science-based path to crush the virus, which is contained in the Heroes Act.” Democrats and the White House have most recently proposed $2.2 trillion and $1.9 trillion relief packages, respectively. Despite the similar target price tags for legislation, the sides still have not resolved disputes over testing, extra unemployment insurance, state and local government relief and liability protections for businesses, among other issues.

,"PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 26, 2020 Losses in the stock market accelerated today as new data showed an increased number of coronavirus infections in both Europe and the United States. In an effort to combat the disease, countries are once again putting restrictions in place, raising the concern of another lockdown that further harms global economic activity. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished the day down 1.82%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.5% down and the Dow Jones performed the worst (DIA) finishing 2.21%. Unfortunately, over the weekend, the US posted consecutive days of record high infection, with more than 80,000 new cases confirmed on Friday and Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. States in the Midwest of the US have been the most affected, most likely due to a resistance by the population to wear masks and colder temperatures.. Over the past seven days, the country reported an average of about 68,767 new cases every day, the highest seven-day average recorded yet, again according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Worryingly, The seven-day average is up more than 22% compared to last week, an extremely worrying increase. Adjusted for population, the Dakotas, Wisconsin, Montana and Idaho are reporting more average daily new cases than anywhere else in the country. Sadly, Johns Hopkins University reported there were 225,111 COVID-19 related deaths across the country as of Sunday afternoon. By comparison, there were 291,557 American soldiers killed in battle during World War II, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Europe is faring no better, with countries reporting a record number of infections over the weekend and announcing a host of new restrictions. On Sunday, France reported 52,000 positive cases, a record for the country. In response, two-thirds of the country has been placed under strict, 9 p.m. curfew. In Italy, 15,199 new cases of the virus were reported, well above the previous record of 11,705. In response, the Italian government has implemented restrictions, shutting down gyms, pools and movie theaters, putting an early curfew on cafes and restaurants and mandating that people keep wearing masks outdoors. Spain, which has also been struggling with a record number of infections, declared a nationwide state of emergency and imposed a curfew. With the November election a mere 8 days away, the chances for the passage of additional virus-relief have all but disappeared. In a letter to her fellow Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed the Republicans for the failure to act in the face of the pandemic, calling their response “arrogance”. She said, “The Republicans’ continued surrender to the virus - particularly amid the recent wave cases - is official malfeasance. We must come to an agreement as soon as possible. But we cannot accept the [Trump] administration’s refusal to crush the virus, honor our heroes or put money in the pockets of the American people. That attitude clearly explains why the White House has not embraced the science-based path to crush the virus, which is contained in the Heroes Act.” Democrats and the White House have most recently proposed $2.2 trillion and $1.9 trillion relief packages, respectively. Despite the similar target price tags for legislation, the sides still have not resolved disputes over testing, extra unemployment insurance, state and local government relief and liability protections for businesses, among other issues.

,"PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 26, 2020 Losses in the stock market accelerated today as new data showed an increased number of coronavirus infections in both Europe and the United States. In an effort to combat the disease, countries are once again putting restrictions in place, raising the concern of another lockdown that further harms global economic activity. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished the day down 1.82%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.5% down and the Dow Jones performed the worst (DIA) finishing 2.21%. Unfortunately, over the weekend, the US posted consecutive days of record high infection, with more than 80,000 new cases confirmed on Friday and Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. States in the Midwest of the US have been the most affected, most likely due to a resistance by the population to wear masks and colder temperatures.. Over the past seven days, the country reported an average of about 68,767 new cases every day, the highest seven-day average recorded yet, again according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Worryingly, The seven-day average is up more than 22% compared to last week, an extremely worrying increase. Adjusted for population, the Dakotas, Wisconsin, Montana and Idaho are reporting more average daily new cases than anywhere else in the country. Sadly, Johns Hopkins University reported there were 225,111 COVID-19 related deaths across the country as of Sunday afternoon. By comparison, there were 291,557 American soldiers killed in battle during World War II, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Europe is faring no better, with countries reporting a record number of infections over the weekend and announcing a host of new restrictions. On Sunday, France reported 52,000 positive cases, a record for the country. In response, two-thirds of the country has been placed under strict, 9 p.m. curfew. In Italy, 15,199 new cases of the virus were reported, well above the previous record of 11,705. In response, the Italian government has implemented restrictions, shutting down gyms, pools and movie theaters, putting an early curfew on cafes and restaurants and mandating that people keep wearing masks outdoors. Spain, which has also been struggling with a record number of infections, declared a nationwide state of emergency and imposed a curfew. With the November election a mere 8 days away, the chances for the passage of additional virus-relief have all but disappeared. In a letter to her fellow Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed the Republicans for the failure to act in the face of the pandemic, calling their response “arrogance”. She said, “The Republicans’ continued surrender to the virus - particularly amid the recent wave cases - is official malfeasance. We must come to an agreement as soon as possible. But we cannot accept the [Trump] administration’s refusal to crush the virus, honor our heroes or put money in the pockets of the American people. That attitude clearly explains why the White House has not embraced the science-based path to crush the virus, which is contained in the Heroes Act.” Democrats and the White House have most recently proposed $2.2 trillion and $1.9 trillion relief packages, respectively. Despite the similar target price tags for legislation, the sides still have not resolved disputes over testing, extra unemployment insurance, state and local government relief and liability protections for businesses, among other issues. Highlights Amid the rising number of coronavirus infections, stocks like hotels, cruise lines, and airlines that benefit from economic reopening, dropped steeply, underperforming the broader market in an already bad day. AstraZeneca (AZN) announced that their vaccine candidate produced a robust immune response in elderly participants. AZN outperformed the market, up 2% at the time of writing. Shares of Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX) came under pressure after China said it would impose sanctions on the defense units of the companies following the U.S. approval of a $1.8 billion arms sale to Taiwan last week. China, which considers Taiwan to be part of its territory, has not yet specified the sanctions that will be put into place. Shares were down around 3% in average at the time of writing.
