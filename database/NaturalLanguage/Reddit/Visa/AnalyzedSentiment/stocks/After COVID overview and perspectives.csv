Companies selling necessities will do well in all scenarios.With the travel advisories placed by the US CDC against travel to France, and official 4th waves starting in countries around the world, there will not be a huge tourism boom coming. I'd expect airlines to have a price dip again. Vaccination proof has to be some form of foolproof system for airlines to possibly work and that's no simple task.I'm seeing alot of talk about housing being a bubble again.I saw an article where someone from the FED indicated they would start tapering in the fall. This means buying less treasuries per month, injecting less money into the stock market, potentially causing a correction. The FED also indicated to large investment banks to each produce $1T in collateral by/on Oct 1, 2021 to ensure stability incase there is a severe correction. That indicates they see potential for bad times and may have not told the full story about their market stress tests that took place recently.",1,0.53,0.991,NEGATIVE

Ideas?","I can't see the future, but I can guarantee that the older generations, which have amassed the largest personal wealth in history, will spend their money struggling to find care as they age and will spend everyone trying to live longer. I work in healthcare, I see this all of the time. I'm long healthcare everything. It's also my view as well that covid is going to lead to massive burnout and attrition of healthcare providers and staff. I'm super long on telehealth everything, home care, healthcare REITs, biotech, med tech. We also don't have nearly enough housing for the elderly and they'll get care at home, so I'm long LHCG and ADUS for home health and hospice. I'm long home monitoring, which is also TDOC. The population is aging and the younger are getting less healthy than before. If you want to tie this into covid specifically, look at long term care hospitals like SEM, HCA even. Look at pharma that makes blood thinners for those blood clots, like PFE and BMY, biosimilars like VTRS. PFE and BMY get way more revenue than just blood thinners, but that's how I think about it from covid.",0,0.535,0.801,NEGATIVE
