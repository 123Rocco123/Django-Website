,"This big drop in stock prices in tech is going to be very good for the big profitable companies. I think we will see a slew of acquisitions over the next couple of months as a lot of the tech stocks are down 50% or more. MSFT won’t be the only company taking advantage of cheaper prices to make big moves. There are several sectors that we will see huge consolidation in my opinion: Semi-Conductors: Nvidia deal to buy ARM is going to be cancelled. That will give them money to target a different company that will not face so many regulation issues. Other electronic makers want to be like Apple and start supplying their own chips. Target companies: HIMX - My top pick. Crazy undervalued with only a 6 PE and being a Taiwanese company they could easily be bought. I could see Samsung (current customer) or other big tech. The bigger company of Taiwan Semi-conductor might make a move too since they already have a huge market share and it makes the most sense. Synaptic Inc (SYNA) - 62 PE so still expensive but down 35% from its height. Cadence (CDNS) - High PE of 57 but gaining market share every month. Crush earnings every quarter. There are other private chip manufactures that could easily be purchased as well. Fintech Companies are going to consolidate. The big companies like PayPal, Block (Square), and even Apple wants to get into the payment service and they all have plenty of money to spend. Possible targets: Upstart (UPST) - Down by 75% from its high. They can still get a nice premium for their company if they sell soon. Affirm (AFRM) - BNPL is big still and they already have contracts with Amazon, Apple, and Shopify. I wouldn’t be surprised if they get bought by one of these three. SOFI - Still expensive but now with the bank charter approved it could be tempting for a huge firm like Goldman or big payment companies like Visa. I know some people think this couldn’t happen but a 500B market cap company could easily buy a 10B market cap company. HOOD - They are getting beat up so its an opportunity to buy a lot of customers for a pretty cheap price from the bigger brokerages. Again, Goldman, Schwab, etc…. I also think the insurance industry is going to consolidate as well. I wouldn’t be surprised to see LMND get bought or even ROOT.",You just listed your bags,0,0.508,0.997,NEGATIVE

I sold the ones I had for profits awhile ago. I know UPST couldn’t hold that level so I sold over $300. I even sold my NVDA when it was around $300. No bag holding here. I’ve never owned HOOD, SYNA, CDNS. I sold AFRM at $120 and SOFI at $20. I think they are levels now that look attractive so I’m sure other people are thinking the same thing.

It seems to fall into Fintech space but also now has a bank charter. GS has been working with Apple to handle their payments and there isn’t a lot of places to expand their business unless they keep looking at investment firms. I think SOFI has the right idea by diversifying into regular banks, loans, online payments, and even crypto in the future. They were losing a lot of money every quarter but if they turn positive soon which seems possible then they should have a much higher market cap. I think being special purpose listing might have hurt them. At $12 a share it is undervalued in my opinion and I think the big companies might be thinking the same thing.",1,0.532,0.704,NEGATIVE

The big companies like PayPal, Block (Square), and even Apple wants to get into the payment service and they all have plenty of money to spend. Possible targets: Upstart (UPST) - Down by 75% from its high. They can still get a nice premium for their company if they sell soon. Affirm (AFRM) - BNPL is big still and they already have contracts with Amazon, Apple, and Shopify. I wouldn’t be surprised if they get bought by one of these three. SOFI - Still expensive but now with the bank charter approved it could be tempting for a huge firm like Goldman or big payment companies like Visa. I know some people think this couldn’t happen but a 500B market cap company could easily buy a 10B market cap company. HOOD - They are getting beat up so its an opportunity to buy a lot of customers for a pretty cheap price from the bigger brokerages. Again, Goldman, Schwab, etc…. I also think the insurance industry is going to consolidate as well.

,"This big drop in stock prices in tech is going to be very good for the big profitable companies. I think we will see a slew of acquisitions over the next couple of months as a lot of the tech stocks are down 50% or more. MSFT won’t be the only company taking advantage of cheaper prices to make big moves. There are several sectors that we will see huge consolidation in my opinion: Semi-Conductors: Nvidia deal to buy ARM is going to be cancelled. That will give them money to target a different company that will not face so many regulation issues. Other electronic makers want to be like Apple and start supplying their own chips. Target companies: HIMX - My top pick. Crazy undervalued with only a 6 PE and being a Taiwanese company they could easily be bought. I could see Samsung (current customer) or other big tech. The bigger company of Taiwan Semi-conductor might make a move too since they already have a huge market share and it makes the most sense. Synaptic Inc (SYNA) - 62 PE so still expensive but down 35% from its height. Cadence (CDNS) - High PE of 57 but gaining market share every month. Crush earnings every quarter.
