You predict that after 100 rolls you will have rolled more 7's than anything else. Would you be worried if after the first 5 rolls you hadn't rolled a 7? No, you would expect that. Just because statistically after 100 rolls you're almost guaranteed to roll more 7's than anything else doesn't mean that you'll always be rolling 7's. Stocks are the same way, you can predict based off various factors how you think a stock will do in the long term, but in the short term price fluctuations will still be ""random"". You should not allow short term results to affect your long term prediction.This is of course all predicated on the assumption that you know what you're doing and know how to make reliable long term predictions of stock prices",0,0.536,0.993,NEGATIVE

Their net income is fairly predictable considering that:Revenues grew at a quasi constant growth rate year over year (10% both on average and median) with roughly 6% st.deviation throughout the last 10+ yearsThe only source of variability comes from their operating expenses which have a higher st.dev (~26% if excluding an extraordinary provision for legal fees back 2012 if I remember correctly)Non-operating income is immaterial and one can easily predict next year's earnings by plotting a linear regression (assuming a marginal tax rate of 20%) with extremely high r square This will allow to calculate a fairly accurate forward P/E ratio and EPS obviously.Then you draw your own conclusions if the company attracts you based on a simple, naive model like I outlined above.When you look at the competitive environment Visa operates in, my opinion is as follows:Bargaining power of buyers is lowBargaining power of suppliers is lowThreat of new entrants is lowThreat of substitutes is medium (considering the whole crypto potential and decentralized ecosystem that fintech is working on. However, this shouldn't pose a risk for credit card companies in the short to medium term because adoption of crypto as a mean of payment is still too low and transaction costs immensely high)Competitive rivalry is high (Mastercard, Amex, capital one, paypal all increase competition especially considering that Visa doesn't really offer a unique product compared to its peers)Don't forget that as inflation keeps running high, the cost of living will go up as well translating into more transactions. More transactions through credit cards means higher fees and commissions for Visa. The switch will happen mostly for non-discretionary goods and services than pure luxury items. Visa also partnered with millions of merchants to offer crypto payment solutions, definitely a smart move to jump on the crypto train. Finally, pretty much all banks in the world offer Visa partnered cards to their clients giving a massive advantage to this company over its peers",0,0.543,0.776,POSITIVE

This is why so many value investors have been shouting that the market is overvalued.If the company's earnings double (hypothetically) then the new PE is 22.5, which is more reasonable.I'm not saying they won't grow at that nice accelerated rate. You mentioned you were a rookie, so I'm presenting you with a question that requires thought and hopefully inspires learning. If you think that a PE of 45 is okay because everyone else has a PE in that range, then you need to rethink things.",0,0.586,1.0,NEGATIVE

I just look at other competitors in the same space like MA (PE of 41), PYPL (PE 45) . I do get a bit worried when comparing it to AMEX with a PE under 20. I figured VISA's excessive PE multiple is already responsible for the fall from the ATH from July 2021. So it's been priced in, so to speak.Apparently it's not enough.
