,"So my situation is as follows, I was an international student for 4 years and got my SSN through employment on campus. I opened a Chase bank account and opened a WeBull brokerage account in my last year. I was unable to find a job before my visa deadline and emptied my accounts and left the country. As far as I know I have my SSN for life and have an American bank account. Can I still trade even if my visa is expired (obviously I plan to pay tax when making withdrawals) could anyone explain this to me or link me to some information for someone in my situation? I held an F-1 student visa in case that matters. Thanks in advance",As long as you keep paying tax on gains in the US it's fine. You have the SSN needed to pay tax. That's all govt cares about.,0,0.522,0.504,POSITIVE

I know E-Trade does for some countries.,0,0.535,0.993,NEGATIVE
