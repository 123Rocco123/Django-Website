,"Are earnings for this quarter behaving like we are in a recession? My take is the 'earnings compression' if it does happen will have to be postponed to Q3 instead of Q2, by which points inflation will really cool down (based on crashing commodity prices, falling gas prices, tightening real estate, food crisis being overblown). So far, we are not seeing changes in the earning denominator sufficient to really increase P/E ratios dramatically. These are obviously cherry-picked, but I tried to add as many examples and statements as I could. If the consumer really were so weak, you wouldn't see so many contrarian statements from major banks, restaurant chains, auto makers, credit card processors, etc. GDP/inflation numbers are very aggregative metrics, so let's dive into what the actual companies are reporting. I will not link to where many of these quotes come from due to time and this not being an academic paper, but I took most of them from the news articles in Bloomberg/CNBC/Seeking Alpha and can be googled for verification. Big Banks: JPM expects credit losses to remain abnormally low through much of 2023, because customers haven’t yet drained cash balances that grew fatter during the pandemic, executives said Monday. “Big picture, the near-term credit outlook, especially for the U.S. consumer, remains strong,” said CFO Jeremy Barnum. C: ""Little of the data I see tells me the U.S. is on the cusp of a recession. Consumer spending remains well above pre-COVID levels with household savings providing a cushion for future stress. And as any employer will tell you, the job market remains very tight. BAC: ""Our U.S. consumer clients remained resilient with continued strong deposit balances and spending levels,"" said CEO Brian Moynihan. Earlier this month, BofA said credit and debit card spending rose 11% in June. Restaurants/Food: Chipotle/MCD report weakening demand from lower income consumers, but overall strong sales beats. In MCD, they see more substitution from fancier restaurants to MCD, and for Chipotle, they already cater to a slightly richer crowd. Major beat from KO. “We continue to see resilience and a lot of demand not just in the U.S. but across the world,” Coke Chief Financial Officer John Murphy said. Consumers who missed experiences such as dining out and entertainment during the first two years of the Covid-19 pandemic are willing to spend more now, Coke Chief Executive James Quincey said. Executives said the company is preparing for consumers’ purchasing power to come under increasing pressure in the second half of the year. Credit Card: Visa reporting strong consumer and lots of travel.

Tuesday, GM said it expects to make more money in the second half of the year. F expects earnings to triple Mercedes: said it expects demand for its vehicles to outstrip supply for the rest of the year. Travel: Hilton sees strong growth: The hotel industry has benefited from people spending on travel as well as hotel stays, though rising interest rates and tight financial conditions are stoking fears of a recession. However, credit card and other data indicate that travel demand is likely to remain robust. Software/tech: MSFT with such strong guidance it brought the whole market up after its earnings. Azure grew 40% quarter over quarter, a very slight slowdown. Spotify eclipsed forecasts and added 6mn subscribers to its service in the second quarter, defying the slowdown at Netflix that has weighed on the music company’s stock price. The company ended June with 188mn subscribers, beating its guidance for 187mn. Total users — which includes those who do not pay — also beat expectations, rising to 433mn. JPM on Google after earnings: ""Our primary takeaway is that search’s demand is persistent even in a tough macro advertising environment given its consistent and high ROI while benefiting from its diversification across online and offline as well as across verticals and geographies"" Ecommerce: Etsy with major beats.

During the third quarter, the company recorded 16,693 new orders which were down 8% YoY. The net new orders slumped due to a meaningful rise in cancellations which rose to 24% as the rapid rise in mortgage rates created a minor panic among homebuyers. However, the good news is that management has mentioned in the Q3 earnings call that the reselling demand is quite good, and the cancellations are being resold smoothly."" Commerce Department Data on Retail: ""U.S. retail sales climbed in June by more than forecast in a broad advance, suggesting resilient consumer spending despite decades-high inflation and raising the prospects of an even larger Federal Reserve interest-rate hike this month.

Non-Examples: Retail like WMT/TGT got crushed, but... with the totality of this data, suggests they had poor execution for inventories. They had an issue acquiring good, overbought, and now have to slash prices to get rid of excess inventory. That's less weakening of consumer demand and more bad planning. QComm sees weaker smartphone demand, but on the other hand, AAPL sources say strong demand for its iPhone in China. Best Buy: The retailer said it expects same-store sales to decline around 11% for the fiscal year, compared with the drop of between 3% and 6% that it forecast in May. DPZ had big miss.",It's all due to the strong labor market. Workers are getting raises even if they might not be keeping up with inflation. Also people forget how many Americans haven't made a Student Loan payment in over 2 years. So these people have that extra cash to continue spending even with higher prices until the gov't gets out of the way and resumes the SL payments.Earnings season has been pretty good. Now there is a shift in consumer spending from goods to services. So Best Buy might not be doing as well Hilton or Chipotle & MCD.We might soon be in a recession; but it doesn't feel like one to me. It feels like 2000-2002 after dot com. History said we were in a recession then; but living thru that time in my early 20's it sure didn't feel like a recession as the job market outside of the dotcom start up crash was really strong.,0,0.539,0.943,NEGATIVE

DPZ had big miss.","I think a lot of your takes are not correct. For example, Etsy major beat and acquiring 6M new buyers. I don’t know where this comes from. Etsy’s reported buyers has declined from Q4 and Q1. It’s up about 3M from one year ago. The “beat” should be taken in the context of a much greater decline in earnings was expected. Earnings have still declined.Google and MSFT both missed top and bottom . MSFTs cloud guidance was just a reiteration of previous guidance.My take is you’re looking at stock reactions rather than the numbers. Earnings season so far has been as expected. Slowing growth, an increase in misses. Decreasing magnitude of beats. The broader picture is the macro environment is worsening.Stock reactions have generally seemed to be relief that it wasn’t worse, but the numbers themselves show growth is slowing and earnings are under pressure.The market is very fickle and short sighted. In this backdrop, we’re seeing a rally because it’s not terrible. But a rational observer wouldn’t expect terrible earnings right now.The sentiment I hear a lot of right now is that the pessimists are all mistaken. Things are fine. But this sort of assumes that everything would turn on a dime. It doesn’t. The economy, absent huge shocks like Covid lockdowns or the financial crisis is a slow moving thing.

We've had falling gas prices for the entire month. Will it help with jobs at all? What about July inflation.We get jobs on the 5th and CPI on the 10th. I think that will go a long way to indicating if we are in a recession or not.

,"Are earnings for this quarter behaving like we are in a recession? My take is the 'earnings compression' if it does happen will have to be postponed to Q3 instead of Q2, by which points inflation will really cool down (based on crashing commodity prices, falling gas prices, tightening real estate, food crisis being overblown).

C: ""Little of the data I see tells me the U.S. is on the cusp of a recession. Consumer spending remains well above pre-COVID levels with household savings providing a cushion for future stress. And as any employer will tell you, the job market remains very tight.

Earlier this month, BofA said credit and debit card spending rose 11% in June. Restaurants/Food: Chipotle/MCD report weakening demand from lower income consumers, but overall strong sales beats. In MCD, they see more substitution from fancier restaurants to MCD, and for Chipotle, they already cater to a slightly richer crowd. Major beat from KO. “We continue to see resilience and a lot of demand not just in the U.S. but across the world,” Coke Chief Financial Officer John Murphy said. Consumers who missed experiences such as dining out and entertainment during the first two years of the Covid-19 pandemic are willing to spend more now, Coke Chief Executive James Quincey said. Executives said the company is preparing for consumers’ purchasing power to come under increasing pressure in the second half of the year.
