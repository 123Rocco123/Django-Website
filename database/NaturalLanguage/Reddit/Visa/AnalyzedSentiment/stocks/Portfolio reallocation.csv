,"So I put around 30% of my portfolio in Visa back in 2018 (risky I know) but now I want to reallocate this in my portfolio. I’m curious, how much of an individual stock % wise to do all keep MAX at a time? Do you try to keep an even x% in individual stocks across the board in your riskier plays, and keep a larger percentage in ETFs? Thanks for any help","Depends on your risk tolerance/conviction in the name. A third of your portfolio seems steep since you view it as a risky play. I'd start with what's a number that wouldn't make you look at the % and think, oh man that's a lot of Visa.If you're looking for a more exact answer, you could instill position limits of 5-10% on yourself. For example, some people might say 5% maximum initial weighting, 10% maximum overall.On a personal level- I keep all ETFs in retirement accounts and a few decently concentrated positions in my brokerage.",0,0.507,0.986,NEGATIVE
