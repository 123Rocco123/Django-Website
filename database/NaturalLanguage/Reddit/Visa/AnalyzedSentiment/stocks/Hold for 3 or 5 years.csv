Just ideas coming to mind.","I have a portion (majority) of my portfolio in “set it and forget it” indexes/mutual funds, and a set amount for penny plays and speculative sectors.I decide to sell by the individual play. Some pennys I plan for a quick in and out (catalyst plays on news, mergers, approvals, etc), or hold long term for 2x, 4x, or more returns when you feel confident you’re in early on a company with strong financials, revenue, and isn’t diluting on their shareholders.Short answer - make a game plan for your stocks. If you feel there’s better plays out there and you’ve lost confidence in what you’re holding, move that money to something else.Market conditions and market sentiment towards industries and companies are always a factor in your moves.",0,0.534,1.0,NEGATIVE
