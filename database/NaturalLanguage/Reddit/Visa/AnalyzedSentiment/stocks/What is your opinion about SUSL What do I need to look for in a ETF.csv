,"I want to diversity my portfolio so I started looking into ETFs and found this ETF called ishares ESG MSCI USA leaders. The ticker is SUSL. It’s a relatively new ETF. It was started in 2020. It’s basically takes all the companies that rank highly on the ESG fund rating. One reason it was more attractive to me than say SPY, VOO and other etfs is that it’s relatively very cheap and the quantity I get for the same investment is higher.also with the world moving towards more stringent environmental policies I think that ESG oriented shares will grow at a faster rate. Looking it up on ishares.com the total return from inception is 20.23 percent. Which I believe is good. Some of the Holdings as of 2021 are Microsoft, google, Tesla, JNJ, Visa, nivida, Disney, PG and MasterCard with Microsoft holding 10 percent weight. Basically most of the companies in SPY. The chart is also very similar in movement with SPY. It’s also attractive because it seems to have similar returns compared to SPY for let’s say 10,000 dollars investment. Based on the information available on yahoo finance spy closed at 322.42 on feb 24th 2020. SUSL closed at 56.60. If $10,000 was invested in SPY on feb 24th 2020 then today the return would be 1652 dollars. The same for SUSL would be 1628 dollars. The difference is 24 dollars. Even the dividend returns is similar. For 10000 dollars you get around 27 SPY and 156 SUSL. based on Nasdaq SPY gave out $5.691 and SUSL gave out $0.896 respectively per share in the whole of 2020. Assuming the same dividends are given out in 2021 then Spy earns 153 vs 140 for SUSL. The difference is 13 dollars. I understand SPY and SUSL are not the same because the holding percentages are different and the volume for SUSL is considerably low. SUSL volume is consistently below 25k where as spy has a volume of around 50 million. But chart wise the movement and growth seems to be similar. I am not saying SUSL is a better investment than SPY. Honestly I know the above information is not enough to make a decision. I like the fact that I get more shares for SUSL while gettomv similar returns but What else do I need to look at to figure out if SUSL is good or not? Does having low volume hurt?",Is Cathie Wood running the ETF is the only thing you really need to know about ETFs.,0,0.51,0.955,POSITIVE
