,"In the past years I did invest in standard ETF (70 % World and 30 % Emerging Markets). Now I would like to try out ETF and shares that are more focused in certain sectors and technologies. I'm interested in cloud computing, information technology as a whole and clean energy. Many ETF in these sectors had a tremendous growth in the past 12 months. Though that does not guarantee the growth will continue. Still I think that cloud computing and IT has a big potential in the long term as it will get more important. Clean energy could get more important over time as well as more and more countries starting to take the change serious. Not so sure about short to mid term developments though.

Information Technology: Xtrackers MSCI USA Information Technology UCITS ETF 1D https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BGQYRS42#overview US IT companies with heavy focus on Apple and Microsoft. Involves other companies I'm interested in as Visa, Paypal etc. Clean Energy: iShares Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?index=S%2526P%2BGlobal%2BClean%2BEnergy&groupField=index&from=search&isin=IE00B1XNHC34 This one had a growth of more than 100 % in the last 12 months. On the other hand it took a giant dive in 2008 and it took until now to recover from it. Might be more risky than the other 2 ETF. What do you think about these ETF? Especially for Cloud Computing and IT I'd like to invest in over the next few years but I'm interested in the IT sector and related businesses in general. Maybe adding sectors in the long term like Blockchain, AI, video game industry etc. On the other hand I'm wondering if I see things to optimistic regarding their growth and importance over the next years.",You are what you eat!,1,0.5,1.0,POSITIVE
