,"Tell me if I'm missing something... Visa and Mastercard seem to be joined at the hip. Their charts, P/E, forecasts, dividends, etc are similar. Currently down about 15% on Visa so I'm thinking of selling at a loss to offset taxes on some of my gains this year and moving that money temporarily into Mastercard. Then when the new year hits, switch it right back into Visa (I prefer this since it's my payment method of choice). You guys seeing anything I'm not? If it continues to drop, I can then start my next year with realized losses again. Win/win right? (Not counting the fact that I've lost money on this investment)",I guess I was bottom fishing last week when I purchased Visa. But I’m hoping long-term it will go back up again. For the record I’ve owned American Express shares (also down 20%) for over 30 years. But never Visa or a MasterCard.,0,0.541,0.908,NEGATIVE
