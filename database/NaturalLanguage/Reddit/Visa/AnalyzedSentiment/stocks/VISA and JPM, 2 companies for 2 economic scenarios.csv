,"Disclaimer I held a position in Visa and a smaller one in JP Morgan for a couple years, and plan on adding some shares in the next few days Rates cuts and higher inflation = great time for VISA. A expansionary monetary policy would increase consumer spending in real terms, and accelarate nominal spending even higher because of inflation. Both of these trends would benefit VISA, since it has great pricing power and charges a fixed percentage on any transaction. VISA has little need for capital, so an increase in nominal spending would boost revenues while inflation is unlikely to affect his costs, thus further expanding it's already incredible margins. I believe the transition away from cash to card would be accelarated, both because of less cash in the wallet and the advantages of financing purchases at lower rates. I think visa could return 15% y/y in this situation, with 12 free cash flow growth and FCY of 3%. The only risk I see are slower growth (current PE of 30) and governament regualtions. High rates low inflation = great time for JPM. In this situation JP Morgan chase would probably be able to expand its balance sheet, because of people moving their asset into JPM from smaller and riskier banks, as well as Aquistions of distressed banks very short on liquidity. In addition, the Bank would be able to employ this capital at high rates, and increase its credit spread substantially. All of this should lead to massive profits, putting JPM fortress balance sheet in an enviable position, like we saw in 2022. I'm this scenario I think 15% returns are possible ( 6% free cash flow growth and 9% FCY) The main risk I see is a fall in CIB revenues and some losses on the asset side (few distressed loans and marking to market some bonds with high duration) The financial sector is historically quite risky, and prudence is key when investing, however I think these companies will do great is some scenario, and good in others, and survive in all but the most tragic ones, thus MAY offer and interesting Risk/Reward proposition. What are your thoughts of these companies? Do you agree/disagree with my predictions? Why?","Huh? Doesn‘t high inflation lead to rate increases and low inflation to rate cuts, generally? Seems to me you‘ve got it the wrong way around.",0,0.509,NEGATIVE,1.0

So either JPowell decide to keep rates high and combat inflation (like he is doing now) or may decide that the economy is weak, and it is necessary to cut rates and let inflation run a bit (like he did in 2021).
