,"I’m 21 years old without any debts or larger spendings and had ~5k to spend. My idea was to put them into stocks due to the recent developments around the world for until I might use the money (3-5 years from now) My idea was: 10x Apple 5x Microsoft 50x Plug power 5x Walt Disney 2x Facebook 3x visa 7x AMD 1x Nvidia 30x Xiaomi I decided for those shares because these are really the only ones I know that I “believe” in and most of these are bigger names around the world. Furthermore the idea was to keep investing 1k/2 months until end of 2021 (evenly distributed across all shares) and then letting it sit for at least until 2023. What are your thoughts, would you advise to keep away from any of those mentioned above? Thanks! Edit: some people told me to wait until investing because of the high fluctuation currently (Covid news basically dominating the stock market in Europe) but I am certain that it doesn’t really matter in the long run if I eagerly wait for a “drop” to come and keep thinking afterwards why didn’t I wait x days for drop y to happen.","Don’t attempt to time the market. Although things may be more volatile right now, it’ll still more than likely be higher in a year or two.Sounds like a good plan. Find stocks you believe in. If you’d like more passive investing, you could also diversify more by investing in ETFs. Look at ones that track the SP500, Nasdaq, and ESG companies. With those three alone, you’d have exposure to hundreds of companies.",0,0.551,0.789,NEGATIVE

It's impossible to tell what the coming weeks and months hold. Instead of dumping in everything now or waiting until things have ""settled"" (at which point you've likely missed the rebound), just invest $500 or $1000 a month until you're fully invested. With some investing platforms offering fractional shares, you can still buy a piece of all of the companies you listed.",1,0.533,0.987,NEGATIVE

I can certainly see your point for Visa as I was torn between Visa, MasterCard and Square myself. However after some research I think that either of these will have a return in the long run it just differs by what percentage.
