Rule of thumb is you have to be ~10X better to dislodge the incumbent.I think as we move toward micropayments and streaming payments, the pull-style (ie credit) mechanism that Visa uses will not be as scalable as push payments (cash app, etc). If Visa adopts push payments, their profits decrease because instant settlement doesnâ€™t require credit. People will want them to be interoperable so Visaâ€™s network effects become less sticky.
