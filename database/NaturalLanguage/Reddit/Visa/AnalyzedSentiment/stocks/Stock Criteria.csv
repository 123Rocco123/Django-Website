Typically lower P/E stocks may be “cheaper” but it could also indicate less growth in the future. Ultimately it depends on the individual stock and industry.

So, you'd exclude a company like a Home Depot (2.7%), JPM (3.6%), PFE (3.7%), JNJ (2.71%)? Lot of good quality companies you're throwing away.These first two requirements are just too arbitrary (if not stringent). Dividend growth, payout ratio also are very important, not just the current yield. And P/Es may be lower than 15 for many excellent companies that have traded down--why do you demand that the company is expensive?",0,0.557,0.977,NEGATIVE

Solvency is rarely an issue with listed companies. Debt to equity is very much industry specific.

This makes the stock-market average of 15 look tiny.Do you think you'll have decent returns if your minimum PE is 15, in an environment where monetary policy is tightened to an extent not seen in decades?
