The Conference Board publishes its September consumer-confidence index, which measures U.S. attitudes toward jobs and the economy. Consumer confidence improved in August after falling for three consecutive months.

Thursday The Commerce Department publishes a third estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product—a broad measure of the goods and services produced in an economy—after its second estimate showed that the decline in U.S. economic output during that time was less severe than initially estimated. The second estimate showed that the economy contracted at a 0.6% annual rate in the April-through-June period, a slower pace than the 0.9% decline initially estimated, driven in part by an upward revision of consumer spending. China’s National Bureau of Statistics and S&P Global release September surveys of purchasing managers about economic activity in China’s manufacturing sector. China’s agency also releases a separate survey measuring the country’s nonmanufacturing sector. Friday The European Union’s statistics agency releases September inflation figures for the 19-nation eurozone. The bloc’s consumer prices were 9.1% higher in August than the same month a year earlier, the fastest pace since records began in early 1997. The University of Michigan publishes its final reading of consumer sentiment for September. Its initial estimate earlier in the month showed it had ticked up from August’s final reading.
