What are the chances of them going back up to the same numbers ? And how long would that take on average ?,"No. I generally find companies with great price to growth and buy what appears to be a decent price and don’t really worry about how much further it goes. Now if it cuts in half from here then yeah I’ll dump a ton more in but rarely does that happen. Usually just goes a little further south, maybe 10% and on back up. If visa did cut in half it would be at a p/e of 15 in a market of plus 30 p/e average...who would add more to that!",2,0.523,0.999,NEGATIVE

PayPal earnings are in 6 days and I guess people are concerned they might not meet expectations hence the sell off for quite a bit. I'm also eyeing them. I'd say visa is about ready to be bought, PayPal also looks temping but don't wanna be caught out after their earnings. You could play it say buy half now then half after earnings.
