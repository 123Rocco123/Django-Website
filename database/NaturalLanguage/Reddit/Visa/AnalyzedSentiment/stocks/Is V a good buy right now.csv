,"Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I´ll try to do that and post it here. That´s my first analysis for V. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I´ll try to answer everything. Today we will look through the basics of Visa´s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for V´s stock using discounted free cashflow. This is not financial advice and I personally own shares in V. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can. Always do your own due diligence. First let´s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around 39% of their sales comes from Data Processing Revenues. Another 35% comes from Service Revenues. International Transaction Revenues makes up for 20% and the remaining 5% are Other Revenues. For the valuation: We take analyst estimates, we discount that by our required return of 6,9%. Then we use the perpetual growth rate of 2,5% and that gave us a fair value for V´s stock of $222 per share. But because we have to account for V´s equity as well, our fair value of equity would be $220 per share. Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that. With V´s price being at $193 per share right now, it´s kind of undervalued. That´s why I think buying heavily might be a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That´s where you invest every month the same amount. Where I see V´s stock price in 5 years. We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM), the Estimated Growth Rate and the Future P/E Value. With this method I get a stock price of $498 per share which is definitely higher than what it is now. What I´ll do. I believe V is here to stay. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That´s why I will start buying heavily every chance I get. Thank you for reading and I hope I´ll see you again.",It’s a great stock to own and one of the few companies which you don’t have to stress about. Thanks for the write-up!,0,0.572,0.995,POSITIVE

They are literally the definition of usury. They just have overwhelming power due to legacy.Costco fought AMEX recently and outright abandoned them and Amazon seems to be threatening V in the UK and possibly elsewhere. On top of that, new payment system are starting to show up like Paypal and equivalent. India is trying to kill the US processors by offering their own networked system. So yea, there are risks.
