Their research tools are not as powerful as Fidelity, but they are reasonable, and there are plenty of other resources on the internet for research. Their layouts are easy to understand; prices on their main screen are mostly updated every few seconds and trades take place quickly.All in all, I like TDA. I like Fidelity a little better for their layout and their research, but not enough better to make me recommend signing a ""Terms and Conditions"" contract you aren't comfortable with.
