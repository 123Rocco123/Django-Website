,"I'm very interested in hearing your views on this. I have traded both V, MA for while and cannot understand why they are struggling when Paypal flies. - Both V & MA have had excellent earnings report. - Even though the world has been in lock down for a while its obvious that we are moving to better times. - The online market has had a fantastic year. According to MA a 61% YoY increase. This has meant a drastic reduction in cash payment. so in short reports are good, market is good, cash payment is in decline. AND still only paypal is going up. Any of you have any thoughts?","I wouldn’t call their reports excellent. Payment volumes have been down with V because of the pandemic. They got about 20% of their revenue from cross-border transactions, and as you can imagine, it has taken a significant hit from obvious reasons. I’d imagine same has been going on with MA.We’re moving to better times, but when those times come, no one can be sure. Fear and uncertainty are one of the biggest enemies for companies.I’m long in V and I don’t think this has any negative long term changes for the either companies.PayPal is going up partially because I’d consider it more as a growth stock, whereas V and MA are more mature when you compare them to PayPal.But V and MA have an incredible moat and good business models, so I see both as quality investments. V is aiming for more fintech and crypto than ever before, since they know that they need to keep things new and innovative in order to compete at a top level in the business. They made a partnership announcement yesterday which showed again that they certainly are taking crypto and innovation seriously. Same with MA too.",0,0.536,1.0,NEGATIVE

Any of you have any thoughts?","Three things worry me about V/MA. First, the rise of other fintech alternatives bypass V/MA so even though cashless payments continue to rise, V/MA don't benefit as much as expected. Second, regulation may reduce what V/MA can skim off every transaction. Maybe this is not so much a concern in the U.S. because of lax regulation but I feel worldwide there will be a push to get this sort of thing under control, especially with the predatory buy-now/pay-later companies taking a huge cut now. The more people who go cashless, the more push back there may be for paying 2% on everything you spend. Third, the rise in V/MA's stock over the last five years seems rather incredible for the nature of the companies.",0,0.525,0.998,NEGATIVE
