Do you like visa right now?",Stop being greedy. You’re locking in a loss because of FOMO on something else. The business thesis for facebook hadn’t changed in two months so all this is just because your mad that you didn’t get rich quick.The same thing will happen to you with Visa in two months. Rinse. Repeat. Your psychology is the problem.,2,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE

,"Bought fb kinda high, Been holding bags for a few months. Not really happy on how it’s been performing. About to sell my shares FB and use it to buy shares of visa. What do you guys think? Do you like visa right now?","FB is a one of a kind, scarce social media equity, whereas Visa has, essentially, an identical twin in MA that competes with it. I would never sell FB for Visa. Visa is pricier on PE basis with a slower revenue growth rate. Also, Facebook has so many untapped revenue verticals (payments, social shopping and e-commerce, AR/VR, WhatsApp, IG). I am long FB and all of the social media space, its a wonderful money making sector.",0,0.523,0.999,NEGATIVE
,"Bought fb kinda high, Been holding bags for a few months. Not really happy on how it’s been performing. About to sell my shares FB and use it to buy shares of visa. What do you guys think? Do you like visa right now?",I would. FB is fighting a losing battle vs Apple with the new privacy setting on the new iOS.New administration is looking more into big business monopoly issue.Republicans are coming down hard on section 230 and the democrats wants more tax dollars on top of section 230.I think a many FB users are getting social media fatigue from all the BS going on. You can only beating the dead horse for so long until no one gives a sh*t.I think the next few months - after earning reports - are cool off period for social media and are growing time for travel and spending stocks.,0,0.547,0.971,NEGATIVE

Do you like visa right now?","no, its logic, if FB is cheaper than Visa, why would you trade out of a stock that is cheaper than one you don;t own.why would anyone trade out of a cheaper company to buy a more expensive one.I am guessing he has no idea what he owns, and is only seeing the momentum trading of the stocks ,",2,0.577,1.0,NEGATIVE

It only matters if going forward FB is better or Visa is better.,3,0.564,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Bought fb kinda high, Been holding bags for a few months. Not really happy on how it’s been performing. About to sell my shares FB and use it to buy shares of visa. What do you guys think? Do you like visa right now?","maybe i don't understand the sunk cost comment. yes, i did, I wanted to know what he paid only to understand why he bought it. he said it is down from where he bought it. so if he bought it at a higher price, now that it is lower in theory he should like ti stock more. if he is a real investor and not a trader. if the stock trades down and the company has not changed fundamentally you should want to buy more.whatever metric he used to buy FB, he should use the same for Visa. if Visa is cheaper than buy visa, but if FB is cheaper, why would you sell a stock that is cheaper than the stock you want to buy",4,0.589,1.0,NEGATIVE
