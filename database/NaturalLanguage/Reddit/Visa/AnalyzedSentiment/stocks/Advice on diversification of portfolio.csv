,"Hey there. So, i'm looking for some advice guys or guidelines on the direction of where to look. I'm quite new to investing, my first shares being bought in january 2020 (it was apple) and we all know what happened starting january/february . In no time, the portfolio was something like -60% :)). I knew very few things but i knew not to panic sell and just ride with it, and it turned out to be a great decision. Now, since then, i've constantly made small purchases every know and then (regardless of how the market was doing) and here is how my portfolio is divided (i started investing knowing that i don't need this money in the near future, so i wanna do mostly, if not all, just buy and hold for as long as i can, big/stable companies. I don't wanna try to time the market or day trade (not that i even know how that works lol) ). Here it is: 23% - Nvidia 22% - Apple 14% - Google 9.2% - Mastercard 6.7% - Amazon 6.6% - Microsoft 6.4% - NextEra Energy 4.7% - Tesla 4.4% - Visa 3.5% - Boeing Had pretty good returns on everything so far (best ones on Nvidia and Apple) so although these days were rough, everything it's still in green so i'm pretty happy with that, BUT, i see everything now as a good opportunity to buy at ""sale prices"". But rather than buying more of the stocks i have, i feel like i wanna use this opportunity to diversify the portfolio a little bit (i feel like it's too much towards the tech; by all means correct me if it's not the case here). I kept looking at Coca Cola and Disney (i see this keep going up especially in the coming years, in the idea of everything coming back to normal) for some time now, but i don't know if i should get them or not. Now my question is: If YOU would have this portfolio, what would you buy to diversify it (i don't know, maybe more towards health-care, more consumer , etc) . ANY advice is more than welcome, as i said, i'm pretty new to this, although i think i know a thing or two. Thank you in advance and enjoy the sale i guess :)","You’re definitely way too overweight on tech.I have a similar issue, I’m predominantly in tech/clean energy/EVs. Thought this was reasonably diversified, but the past 2 days have shown that’s not the case lol.You could look to expand into clean energy or healthcare / genomics perhaps?",0,0.515,1.0,NEGATIVE

Now, since then, i've constantly made small purchases every know and then (regardless of how the market was doing) and here is how my portfolio is divided (i started investing knowing that i don't need this money in the near future, so i wanna do mostly, if not all, just buy and hold for as long as i can, big/stable companies. I don't wanna try to time the market or day trade (not that i even know how that works lol) ). Here it is: 23% - Nvidia 22% - Apple 14% - Google 9.2% - Mastercard 6.7% - Amazon 6.6% - Microsoft 6.4% - NextEra Energy 4.7% - Tesla 4.4% - Visa 3.5% - Boeing Had pretty good returns on everything so far (best ones on Nvidia and Apple) so although these days were rough, everything it's still in green so i'm pretty happy with that, BUT, i see everything now as a good opportunity to buy at ""sale prices"". But rather than buying more of the stocks i have, i feel like i wanna use this opportunity to diversify the portfolio a little bit (i feel like it's too much towards the tech; by all means correct me if it's not the case here). I kept looking at Coca Cola and Disney (i see this keep going up especially in the coming years, in the idea of everything coming back to normal) for some time now, but i don't know if i should get them or not. Now my question is: If YOU would have this portfolio, what would you buy to diversify it (i don't know, maybe more towards health-care, more consumer , etc) . ANY advice is more than welcome, as i said, i'm pretty new to this, although i think i know a thing or two. Thank you in advance and enjoy the sale i guess :)",Will do so. Thank you !,1,0.495,0.97,POSITIVE
