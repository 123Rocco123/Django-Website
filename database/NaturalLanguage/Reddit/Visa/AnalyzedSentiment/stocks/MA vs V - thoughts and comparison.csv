,"For those holding MasterCard or Visa in their portfolio, or both, what are your thoughts on these companies? Which do you prefer if you had to choose and why? I have also given some thought to PYPL and SQ, decided on buying SQ a few months ago, so not looking into alternatives. I see MA/V as slow but stable growth stocks, but would prefer to choose the one poised for the most growth. Still doing my own research, just looking for opinions from others. Lots of great info in here.",In the last year they had a great run(precovid). They are both large stable growth companies with a stronghold on the transactional fee business. Unless a real disrupter is created these giants will only continue to dominate. I plan to increase my positions in these companies.,0,0.585,0.964,POSITIVE

I'd prefer to hold only one though, what made you decide to buy into both?",1,0.569,0.711,POSITIVE

Lots of great info in here.",Honestly around 2014-2015 I bought V and then it split and had a little run. I sold it to buy some property to build my house. When I was ready to get back in the game I actually bought Axp since that was the only card I used at the time (I’m a customer of my holdings). Well axp hit a rough patch and I sold axp. I favored V over MA but Ma had better returns at the time so I just said I’m buying both instead of choosing. Having just axp left a bad taste in my mouth when they dropped after an earnings called. The downside is that when the financial sector has bad days hit hits me a little harder.,2,0.532,1.0,NEGATIVE

I'm been looking at both too but I have a position in BAC so don't know if I'm ready to put more money in financials yet. Although both companies are different from the banking sector.,2,0.572,0.997,POSITIVE

Lots of great info in here.","I own MA, V, and PYPL. Have been a shareholder of V since 2009. I’m comfortable holding all 3 because they’re all making significant investments in the next generation of transactions and payment services. Bonus is both V and MA don’t assume any of the underlying credit risk as they merely facilitate the transactions for a fee. Substantial moats especially for V where their market positions are unparalleled. These companies are just buy on dips and steadily accumulate for a decade plus and not worry about it.",0,0.529,0.999,POSITIVE

Financials like banks have dipped as part of the macro trends While neither are banks, they are often lumped into the broader financial sectors.It's a good time to buy either as a long term investment.Can't go wrong with choosing either one.

Lots of great info in here.",I dont think you can go wrong either way. They are good backburner stocks that will probably provide gains roughly inline with eps growth. I see them sort of simmering along gaining 10-20% a year in share price. I own Visa and its about 7-8% of my portfolio but I own nearly 3 times as much SQ dollar wise. I think Square is a more explosive growth play although with added volatility and risk.,0,0.545,0.833,NEGATIVE
