,"I'm from Italy, while the cards are still not as accepted as Visa/MC things are getting much better (one store told me they started accepting them recently since Amex reached out to them and offered a 0% charge for the year) but that's not why I'm here asking this question, they are really ramping up promos with Amazon, tv ads, it looks like they are trying to push them a lot lately and the stock is still down from ATH with a relatively ""low"" PE. What do you think?","All the comments here: this has already been priced in.As for tomorrow morning earnings announcement, I am predicting a jump. I bought AXP stock today.",0,0.567,0.876,NEGATIVE

It’s not accepted everywhere.",0,0.511,0.999,NEGATIVE

What do you think?","AXP might be getting heat over time: they don’t give shit money back, whereas any normal wife’s boyfriend at this point has long since switched to Discover while we’re still here sitting with AMEX... which pretends a $100 a year fee is made up for by occasionally giving you a few shitty Delta miles. As time goes on, AXP seems likely to continue losing market share to its less greedy competitors.",0,0.536,1.0,NEGATIVE

What do you think?","I own $3K+ in AXP (currently down roughly 3%), but I think it is a great stock! A ton of their money is made because of business travel (planes, hotels, et cetera). I 100% believe they will beat expectations tomorrow (still down like 20-25% from last year). When travel returns, they will go up further in value.",0,0.561,0.998,POSITIVE
