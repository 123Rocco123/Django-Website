,"To start this off, I do know Visa dominates the card space by having over 50% of market share with Mastercard controlling around 22% and American Express controlling 18% roughly. Visa and Mastercard both trade around a 33 PE and above a 15 Price to Sales. This is brutal to me and seems all the dominance is priced in or just trading at an overvaluation. AXP trades at a 16 PE and around a 2 Price to Sales. AMEX is right there with MA as far as the market share and they issue their own cards unlike MA. I know they are dominant in their space and create a crazy amount of money but the valuation seems brutal. What is the overall thoughts on V and MA valuation as we stand today?","MasterCard and Visa and technology companies with no underlying exposure to credit.Amex is a bank who also issues it’s own cards and is exposed to underlying credit risk.MA/V business model is lucrative and sustainable outside of the US whereas Amex really isn’t.Truth is, MA/V are VERY different companies from Amex and comparing them is rather useless",0,0.534,0.999,NEGATIVE

What is the overall thoughts on V and MA valuation as we stand today?",I can see it being mixed. A lot of people in USA and Canada use their Visa and MasterCard for all purchases which means no matter what they are going to be charging it. Discretionary spending will definitely be down but essentials like groceries or clothing are going to cost more which will translate over.A lot of other countries don't have the credit card culture that North America does and use it more for discretionary spending which will definitely be impacted so that will hurt.Generally I don't think it will hurt too bad,1,0.513,0.986,NEGATIVE
