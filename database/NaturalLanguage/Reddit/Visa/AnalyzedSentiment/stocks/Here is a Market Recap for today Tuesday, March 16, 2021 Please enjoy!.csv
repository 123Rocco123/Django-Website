,"Stocks fell on Tuesday, after the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow (DIA) set fresh records yesterday, as market participants digested a weaker-than-expected report on retail, rising Treasury yields, and looked ahead to a Federal Reserve policy meeting later this week. Retail sales fell 3% in February from January, the Commerce Department said, worse than the 0.7% decline economists polled by FactSet expected. However, many analysts blamed bad weather and expect incoming stimulus checks to cause retail sales to spike. Last week, after months of negotiations, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package was signed into law by President Biden this week. The bill, called the American Rescue Plan (ARP), includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The passage of the bill came exactly one year after the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Washington’s aggressive spending spree during the pandemic, combined with an increased pace of vaccinations, accommodative monetary policy, and the impending reopening of the economy have pushed estimates for growth higher while also fueling inflationary fears. At the time of writing, the Treasury yield sits at 1.606%. In light of rising Treasury yields, market participants are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve’s meeting on Wednesday, where the Central Bank is widely expected to reiterate its commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy while the economic recovery gains momentum. With large amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus supporting economic activity, analysts at BlackRock are anticipating ""a much stronger post-COVID economic restart than what we would expect in a normal recovery. The rapid upward adjustment in U.S. Treasury yields and more muted movement in inflation-adjusted yields make sense in this respect, and are still consistent with our new nominal theme of higher prices and government liquidity.” Several countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Ireland being the latest. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established. Germany, France, Italy and Spain became the latest countries Monday to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union’s vaccination effort, which were already behind schedule. Highlights Facebook (FB) said Tuesday it plans to offer a free, customizable publishing tool that allows users to develop websites and email newsletters as well as charge for subscriptions. After hitting a low of more than 20% down, Gamestop (GME) stock largely recovered to finish only modestly red. AMC fell around 7% at the time of writing after Citigroup analyst Jason Bazinet reiterated his Sell rating on the stock, with a $2 price target. AMC theaters are set to reopen in Los Angeles, a key market, this week. Volkswagen’s (VWAGY) stock is soaring after recent news that the company is making a push to become the market leader in electric vehicles in Europe. The company recently announced plans to build 6 factories to produce EVs by 2030. Alaska, Florida, Montana, Nevada, and Puerto Rico have joined a lawsuit filed by Texas and others against Google, which accuse it of breaking antitrust law to boost its already dominant online advertising business, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said on Tuesday. Chinese TikTok-owner ByteDance is making plans to develop semiconductors, according to the company's job postings and a source familiar with the situation. The plan is still at an early stage and the company's focus is on Arm-based server-side chips, the person told Reuters. **Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes** DraftKings (DKNG) with three target raises.

,"Stocks fell on Tuesday, after the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow (DIA) set fresh records yesterday, as market participants digested a weaker-than-expected report on retail, rising Treasury yields, and looked ahead to a Federal Reserve policy meeting later this week. Retail sales fell 3% in February from January, the Commerce Department said, worse than the 0.7% decline economists polled by FactSet expected. However, many analysts blamed bad weather and expect incoming stimulus checks to cause retail sales to spike. Last week, after months of negotiations, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package was signed into law by President Biden this week. The bill, called the American Rescue Plan (ARP), includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The passage of the bill came exactly one year after the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Washington’s aggressive spending spree during the pandemic, combined with an increased pace of vaccinations, accommodative monetary policy, and the impending reopening of the economy have pushed estimates for growth higher while also fueling inflationary fears. At the time of writing, the Treasury yield sits at 1.606%. In light of rising Treasury yields, market participants are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve’s meeting on Wednesday, where the Central Bank is widely expected to reiterate its commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy while the economic recovery gains momentum. With large amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus supporting economic activity, analysts at BlackRock are anticipating ""a much stronger post-COVID economic restart than what we would expect in a normal recovery. The rapid upward adjustment in U.S. Treasury yields and more muted movement in inflation-adjusted yields make sense in this respect, and are still consistent with our new nominal theme of higher prices and government liquidity.” Several countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Ireland being the latest. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established. Germany, France, Italy and Spain became the latest countries Monday to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union’s vaccination effort, which were already behind schedule.

Washington’s aggressive spending spree during the pandemic, combined with an increased pace of vaccinations, accommodative monetary policy, and the impending reopening of the economy have pushed estimates for growth higher while also fueling inflationary fears. At the time of writing, the Treasury yield sits at 1.606%. In light of rising Treasury yields, market participants are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve’s meeting on Wednesday, where the Central Bank is widely expected to reiterate its commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy while the economic recovery gains momentum. With large amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus supporting economic activity, analysts at BlackRock are anticipating ""a much stronger post-COVID economic restart than what we would expect in a normal recovery. The rapid upward adjustment in U.S. Treasury yields and more muted movement in inflation-adjusted yields make sense in this respect, and are still consistent with our new nominal theme of higher prices and government liquidity.” Several countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Ireland being the latest. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established. Germany, France, Italy and Spain became the latest countries Monday to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union’s vaccination effort, which were already behind schedule. Highlights Facebook (FB) said Tuesday it plans to offer a free, customizable publishing tool that allows users to develop websites and email newsletters as well as charge for subscriptions. After hitting a low of more than 20% down, Gamestop (GME) stock largely recovered to finish only modestly red. AMC fell around 7% at the time of writing after Citigroup analyst Jason Bazinet reiterated his Sell rating on the stock, with a $2 price target. AMC theaters are set to reopen in Los Angeles, a key market, this week. Volkswagen’s (VWAGY) stock is soaring after recent news that the company is making a push to become the market leader in electric vehicles in Europe. The company recently announced plans to build 6 factories to produce EVs by 2030. Alaska, Florida, Montana, Nevada, and Puerto Rico have joined a lawsuit filed by Texas and others against Google, which accuse it of breaking antitrust law to boost its already dominant online advertising business, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said on Tuesday.

,"Stocks fell on Tuesday, after the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow (DIA) set fresh records yesterday, as market participants digested a weaker-than-expected report on retail, rising Treasury yields, and looked ahead to a Federal Reserve policy meeting later this week. Retail sales fell 3% in February from January, the Commerce Department said, worse than the 0.7% decline economists polled by FactSet expected. However, many analysts blamed bad weather and expect incoming stimulus checks to cause retail sales to spike. Last week, after months of negotiations, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package was signed into law by President Biden this week. The bill, called the American Rescue Plan (ARP), includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The passage of the bill came exactly one year after the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Washington’s aggressive spending spree during the pandemic, combined with an increased pace of vaccinations, accommodative monetary policy, and the impending reopening of the economy have pushed estimates for growth higher while also fueling inflationary fears. At the time of writing, the Treasury yield sits at 1.606%. In light of rising Treasury yields, market participants are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve’s meeting on Wednesday, where the Central Bank is widely expected to reiterate its commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy while the economic recovery gains momentum. With large amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus supporting economic activity, analysts at BlackRock are anticipating ""a much stronger post-COVID economic restart than what we would expect in a normal recovery. The rapid upward adjustment in U.S. Treasury yields and more muted movement in inflation-adjusted yields make sense in this respect, and are still consistent with our new nominal theme of higher prices and government liquidity.” Several countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Ireland being the latest. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established. Germany, France, Italy and Spain became the latest countries Monday to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union’s vaccination effort, which were already behind schedule. Highlights Facebook (FB) said Tuesday it plans to offer a free, customizable publishing tool that allows users to develop websites and email newsletters as well as charge for subscriptions. After hitting a low of more than 20% down, Gamestop (GME) stock largely recovered to finish only modestly red. AMC fell around 7% at the time of writing after Citigroup analyst Jason Bazinet reiterated his Sell rating on the stock, with a $2 price target. AMC theaters are set to reopen in Los Angeles, a key market, this week. Volkswagen’s (VWAGY) stock is soaring after recent news that the company is making a push to become the market leader in electric vehicles in Europe. The company recently announced plans to build 6 factories to produce EVs by 2030. Alaska, Florida, Montana, Nevada, and Puerto Rico have joined a lawsuit filed by Texas and others against Google, which accuse it of breaking antitrust law to boost its already dominant online advertising business, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said on Tuesday. Chinese TikTok-owner ByteDance is making plans to develop semiconductors, according to the company's job postings and a source familiar with the situation.
