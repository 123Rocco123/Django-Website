By predictable I was more saying its cash inflows are ungodly diversified and it isn't going to disappear overnight or something like that.Another point, 38x is their trailing PE. Valuation isn't determined by past results, but future expectations. Forward PE is 29, which is much more reasonable and based off expected 19% earnings growth. That's pretty good considering it's the ~10th largest US company by market cap. So yes I think their PE is fair. Why?Because they're the leader in a highly lucrative duopoly. Generally companies in duopolies have superior ""pricing power"" (kind of a weird thought for a payments company) and frankly I think a lot of the fears that all these new entrants are going to be a serious threat to V and MA are overblown. All of these startups and newcomers are coming to the market because external circumstances are extremely favorable but will not last forever.However I do understand the hesitation to invest. I'm not saying it's going to grow to a $2T company or something like that.

The only thing I don't agree with is the opportunity for challengers to the duopoly simply being the result of external circumstances that will not last forever.It doesn't take a lot for consumers to switch. I used both Visa and Mastercard for purchases when I first started using credit cards, and still do sometimes. But when I discovered AMEX offered me 3% back instead of the 1-2% offered by V and MA it was a no-brainer. Now I use AMEX for everything I can.Granted that's a very simple example, but I think it's true for a lot of people. It only takes saving a little bit extra for people to make a change.However, at this point it is basically opinion and speculation as to whether or not any of the current companies will truly become a serious competitor. Right now you are indeed correct that we have a duopoly in credit services, and it will take a LOT to overcome an industry in that state.I have been a shareholder of both V and MA before and plan to be again--I just want to wait a bit to see what happens I think.Thanks for your insight and information!",4,0.514,0.999,POSITIVE
