,"Al Gore’s investment firm recently made some big changes in its stock investments. Generation Investment Management, which the former vice president co-founded and chairs, dramatically increased investments in software giant Microsoft (ticker: MSFT) and e-commerce provider Shopify (SHOP), initiated an investment in card giant Mastercard (MA), and exited a position in rival Visa (V). The stock trades, among others, were disclosed in a form Generation filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the second quarter. Generation, a London-based firm focused on sustainable and environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, declined to comment. It had more than $36 billion of assets under management as of March 31. The firm bought 3.7 million Microsoft shares to end the second quarter with 4.2 million shares. Microsoft stock slipped 24% in the first half of the year, compared with a 21% drop in the S&P 500 index. So far in the third quarter, shares are unchanged compared with a 3.7% rise in the index. Microsoft has been cutting back on employee expenses by curbing business travel and company gatherings. Consumers have been spending less on videogames in recent months, which may be an issue for the company, which is in the process of acquiring game publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI). Microsoft’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, reported in July, showed its slowest earnings growth in two years. Shopify’s second-quarter report, from July, also disappointed, and revenue growth was hurt by a stronger dollar. Right before the report, Shopify announced the layoff of 1,000 workers, about 10% of its global workforce, as online shopping faded when consumers went back to stores.

And they're already FCF positive so they've demonstrated they can operate profitably.Secondly I don't know if you're trolling because the company has been growing like 30%+ YoY and is probably the most innovative company in the ecommerce space right now. It's funny you're worried about how they might grow because one of my main concerns with SHOP is that they might be doing too much and not focused enough on their core product. If some of their fulfilment and payment bets pay off though there is tons of room for growth left. But even their core product has plenty of room to grow - ecommerce is a growing industry after all.,1,0.558,0.961,NEGATIVE

If thats true then yes, good value over 10 years, but I’m just not confident in that. I expect at points there will be hits to the margins and issues with growth at this scale, not to mention competition, I think this will create a better price for SHOP with less bullish optimism.Right now you need perfect numbers every year.

This would give you revs of $12.4b.Assume the market assigns 20% terminal operating margin. This would give you $2.48b in hypothetical net income.Assume the market assigns a 30PE multiple. This would give you a $74.4b valuation in 5 years.I'd argue those estimates are fairly conservative too. 25-30% YoY growth is probably more likely. But basically it's hard not to see it at least market performing.I agree the risk here is margins and I think that's a valid conservation to have. SHOP's currently trading at a slightly favourable valuation to some other growth tech companies because they've demonstrated they can operate profitably. If they begin to show declining operating leverage this will cause analysts to adjust down their forecasts, and taking the terminal operating margin from 20% to 15% would result in a 25% drop in the stock price.It depends on your risk/reward really. It's not as safe as making an investment in a company with a proven business model which has had stable margins for years. Still, my base case estimates would suggest it should outperform the broader market this decade and significantly outperform if they execute well.I think the real risk for growth tech near-term though is simply the macro. It's just really hard for growth companies to outperform in an environment with a rising 10y yield. Part of the reason I'm bullish on growth tech right now is because long-term valuations seem reasonable to attractive and I suspect near-term (3-6 months) the 10y yield is likely to trend down.Just my thoughts anyway. I can understand why someone wouldn't want to invest in SHOP right now, it's just valuation and growth wouldn't be my primary concern.",3,0.547,1.0,NEGATIVE

SHOP also owns 10% of GLBE, an international payments platforms that handles currency conversion easily for merchants and even provides translation services. Making currency exchange easy is a huge boon for people and businesses. Growth stocks are suppressed by macro conditions, including inflation, lowers ad spend, and supply chain. When those conditions improve, that should be a tailwind for SHOP. The stock returning to its previous valuation (adjusted for the stock split) would be 4x and over the long term, maybe more. I’m talking a 10y timeframe or more. Admittedly, 10x might be overly optimistic. And like I said, I want to see improvements.
