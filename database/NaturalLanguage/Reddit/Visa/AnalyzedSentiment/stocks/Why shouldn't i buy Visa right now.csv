Or should i hold onto my cash for now and wait for a drop off?","Maybe you should. But I'll just say MasterCard and Visa make all their money providing a secure global network for merchants, and then charging those merchants a huge percentage on every transaction, basically in the world.As such, their revenues directly mirror consumer spending, and historically, gasoline prices.They've been ripe for disruption for decades, and now that anyone can have a secure tunnel using the global internet, most of what MA/V provides isn't that important anymore. For the last decade, I'm amazed someone hasn't gutted them just by offering cut rate interchange to merchants.But that seems to be starting to take root, with the various payment provide options.Consumer spending is based on whether or not there's a global recession. And gasoline prices won't be rising any time soon.So that's a few points of headwind against them. But they've stood for a long time, so they're like a vending machine that won't topple until it's been rocked many times.",0,0.526,0.988,NEGATIVE

Or should i hold onto my cash for now and wait for a drop off?","For now no, SQ adds to the Visa and MasterCard networks, but who knows what will happen in the future. Small merchants who were previously unable to take card payments because they were too small for legacy merchant acquirers now can use SQ and others to take card payments. This card payments are Visa and MasterCard and therefore add to their total volumes. Maybe in the future SQ will build their own payments network but I doubt it considering how large its needs to be viable and how tiny SQ is today in comparision.",2,0.517,0.941,NEGATIVE

Or should i hold onto my cash for now and wait for a drop off?","In my opinion they're absolutely a threat. They've eaten up all the small merchants who MA/V's acquirers didn't care about, or, if they did, they were gouging. Now they're eyeing the mid sized ones. Merchants all hate MasterCard and Visa, so whoever comes along with a 75% less expensive option that seems like it would work, they'll be happy to listenI'm kind of surprised Google didn't do a MA/V killer at 1/10th of the going costs.",2,0.514,1.0,NEGATIVE

Or should i hold onto my cash for now and wait for a drop off?","Actually, no. Those rates have absolutely nothing to do with MasterCard and Visa. They don't loan the money or charge the interest. That is done by whoever buys a franchise and issues the card. So if you have a ""Capital One Visa"", then it's Capital One who lends you the money and charges the interest. Visa just takes around $2 on every $100 you spend.So if consumers sit on their wallets in a recession, Mastercard and Visa get slaughtered. They're totally linked to consumer spend, which typically doesn't include things like mortgage payments or rent, but does include things like gasoline purchases, airfare, hotels, restaurants, etc. So when gas prices spike, MasterCard and Visa get lots of extra revenue without one cent of extra costs. But when hotels and restaurants slump, they take a hit for which they can't shed any costs.",2,0.511,1.0,NEGATIVE

Or should i hold onto my cash for now and wait for a drop off?","You're correct. MasterCard and Visa don't own the portfolios, they provide the network and the structure. The servicing and the debt is all done by issuers who use the respective network. That's why it's always a misunderstanding when people see bankruptcies and loan defaults rising and assume that hurts $MA and $V. It doesn't.And every time someone thinks they called Visa and screamed at a visa rep... they didn't. Visa only talks to their issuers (typically banks of some form) or their acquirers (typically banks or sales houses who sign merchants up to contracts)",3,0.52,0.997,NEGATIVE

Or should i hold onto my cash for now and wait for a drop off?","I think you're slightly misplacing the value added by V/MC - it's not the security of the network that matters, but its distribution and pervasiveness.So the internet doesn't really threaten that moat. If anything the network effects are magnified by it.There's so little value in trying to displace said network vs piggybacking on it (like Square and Apple), I wouldn't worry about it. You would spend so much in customer acquisition it would probably take decades to recoup.Where these brands can get threatened is in services, which is why MC has outperformed V.",1,0.538,0.999,NEGATIVE

Or should i hold onto my cash for now and wait for a drop off?","I was being concise. The internet absolutely does supplant the wires and devices and secure network which have been the core of the MasterCard/Visa system for decades. And MC/V distribution and pervasiveness no longer matter now that the entire globe has Internet. There was no way to exploit that connectivity for the prior manifestations of Internet though, since it was anything but secure. (Hence why I emphasized that word.) But with a few generations of ecommerce, we now have sufficient security over Internet that the security of a segmented credit card network is moot.And there's no discernible difference in services between MC and V.
