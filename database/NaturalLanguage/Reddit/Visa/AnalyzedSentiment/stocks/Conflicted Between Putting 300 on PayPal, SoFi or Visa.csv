,"So I have ~$300 left to invest this year. I want to just get my feet wet in some financial sector stocks because I do not own any. I am really torn between these 3 options when it comes to where to start with the finance sector. I use Visa everyday and V has been a consistent stock for along time which is attractive. As far as a long term “safe” bet Visa seems like a solid option for the start of my diversification. PayPal is a name I hear thrown around all the time on these subreddits however I do not understand the hype. Now I am not a person that spends a ton of time diving deep into companies which is where I could be missing something but I do not see Venmo being added as a payment option on Amazon being a game changer for PayPal. For me personally, why would I use Venmo on Amazon when I can just use my VISA credit or Debit Cards? Again, I am not very educated about PayPal as a company so I invite someone to tell me why my belief is wrong. SoFi is the company I just used to refinance my student loans. I do not know much about them aside from their seamless refinancing system and having the best interest rate (for me at least) out of the other companies in loan refinancing. This is the only thing I know about SoFi. If I go with SoFi, why pick them over Visa or PayPal?",I would say V is the safest of those 3.,0,0.501,0.95,NEGATIVE
