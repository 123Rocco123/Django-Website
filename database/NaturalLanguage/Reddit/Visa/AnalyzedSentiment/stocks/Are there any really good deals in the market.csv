I have been primarily buying CVS, PFE, small nibbling at Google and Visa. Got out of BAC and UNH this week.","I think there are a couple of reasons. First reason is the rotation out of the Mag7 due to falling interest rates, profit taking, and maybe some valuation concerns for the group as a whole. So google gets lumped in.Second reason is that there are questions surrounding their moat in search. I think it‚Äôs overblown, but this is the first time in a very long time that anyone is even legitimately trying to take market share from Google. If they take just 5-10% of market share, that will materially impact Google‚Äôs earnings. In my DCF calculation, I drop Google‚Äôs search growth down a lot, and I still get a strong range of investment outcomes for the business as a whole. So I‚Äôm not concerned.The third reason is their earnings I guess. Capex spend was higher than people want, and YouTube Ads growth decelerated. They addressed that the reason for this is because more users are paying for premium. Both of these ‚Äúbad‚Äù things are positives to me. I like that they‚Äôre getting more revenue from premium, and I like that they‚Äôre spending on capex. The most material risk to their business is them being behind in AI, so the capex serves as both defensive (protecting their moat) and offensive (better monetization of their existing properties, and potentially new revenue streams).GOOGL is my largest position, and I‚Äôm buying more here.",1,0.54,NEGATIVE,1.0

We saw this scare with the death of google (chatGPT) and bing, but google kept their 90% market share. In addition there are a lot of people without internet or consistent internet. So growth potential for search is also there should they lose market share. Also a lot of people literally use google as a gateway to get to their webpages instead of typing the web address in the address field. It is THE internet.I‚Äôm guessing what scared investors was the capex for AI. Same way people got scared when META invested into the metaverse. But i wouldn‚Äôt want it any other way either. They have to invest early to not lose out on potential profit generating business in the future. They are also in a position to give users anything chatGPT is giving them with ‚Äúnew search‚Äù because of this. I think they have to invest to keep market share as well as innovate. I also believe the amount of data google has will come into play in the future.It stings a bit now with the heavy capex, but they have a history of allocating cash much better than me (youtube, android, google maps, etc) so i believe my money is safe there for now.",2,0.541,NEGATIVE,0.998

Too many people last year on here tried to be contrarian and avoided what was doing well - instead buying PYPL, CVS, etc.) ""How could CVS go any lower?"" and then they go down another 20% after a horrible quarter. PFE is a company that has had underwhelming shareholder returns now for two decades. It has bounced lately but it's still down over the last year, last five years and is flat for the last twenty years. People talked last year about LLY/NVO being ""too expensive"" and how PFE was a cheaper alternative - picking the cheap and not great over the not cheap but great can often lead to disappointment imo.It is an example of the Buffett saying of ‚ÄúIt's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.‚Äù Pfizer is arguably not a wonderful company - anything that is flat for 20 years has some issues. Felt the same way when everyone was trying to incessantly call the bottom in PARA (barely any return for nearly 35 years) and WBD (-65% since the spin from T barely over two years ago.)Today: ""How Pfizer‚Äôs grand gene therapy ambitions crumbled""""A decade ago, Pfizer began investing heavily in gene therapy, bringing in experimental treatments for a range of genetic diseases, pumping $800 million into ‚Äústate-of-the-art‚Äù manufacturing facilities and announcing its intention to become an ‚Äúindustry leader‚Äù that would deliver ‚Äúone-time, transformative therapies‚Äù for rare diseases.

Not much. MPC is still an example of something that I think is reasonable, well-managed, has a strong moat and is returning a lot of cash to shareholders.I think the Ulta pessimism is excessive. It's not going to provide some sort of home run returns, but I think buying it here over the next year or three will work out well unless there's some sort of 2008 sequel (which I don't see.)I think FRMO is something where the crypto exposure is underappreciated but it could easily continue to be underappreciated for a long time to come. Weird little OTC-traded Berkshire-esque entity run by the managers of Horizon Kinetics.KNSL I thought was a good deal in the $370's and now has taken off after earnings.REMYY is a good deal here imo although be careful as some brokerages charge a lot extra to trade ADRs (symbol ends in Y.) Liquor is having a terrible time lately but there's a point where anyone looking for value can step in especially to something more premium.Really look for things that are a good deal and a good company - there's a lot of things that are either at 52 week lows or near them.

Nike is a maybe, kind of a similar maybe to Intel, both of them require business momentum to improve. Starbucks, McDonald's, cyclical slowdown, not a ton of money but good money in these. UPS is really the interesting company though. Big dividend massive once a decade correction. TLT is another one, if the economy slows more than expected and the Fed has to cut more than expected this is one of the best hedges you can have on your portfolio because it's going to radically outperform while you're losing money on your equities. If we have a soft landing and things go well you should make some money on TLT but if things go south you're going to make really good money on TLT right at the time all the other stocks are on sale making a very convenient sell pointI'm also going to point out there's an argument for this correction in tech and quality companies like KLAC.
