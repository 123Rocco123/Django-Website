,"I’d like to share thesis on Kaspi.kz (KSPI.IL), the largest Payments, Marketplace and Fintech Ecosystem in Kazakhstan with a leading market share in each of its key services and products. At the core of its Ecosystem is the Kaspi.kz Super App, the leading mobile app in the country with 4.9 million DAU (up 155% YoY) and 9.1 million MAU (up 59% YoY), which is roughly half of the country population. The app serves as a single gateway to all of the Company’s services and is an integral part of people’s daily lives in Kazakhstan. As people’s lives become increasingly digitalized Kaspi.kz expects the usage of its Super App to grow, with the COVID-19 pandemic accelerating consumer adoption of cashless payments, e-Commerce and digital financial services. Kaspi.kz is built around an ecosystem business model, where the growth and development of one service contributes to the growth and development of other services, creating a powerful virtuous cycle. A growing number of services being used by the Company’s consumers results in synergies across all of its Platforms, structurally high profitability and creates a powerful self-reinforcing network effect, giving the Company strong competitive advantages. According to the recent Full-Year 20202 Financial Results, total revenue reached KZT641,437 M (~$1.5B), equivalent to adj. 25.5% YoY growth; and net income reached KZT274,318 M (~$0.65B), equivalent to net income 42.8% margin and 43.2% YoY growth. The Kaspi.kz Ecosystem currently comprises the following three market leading Platforms: • Payments Platform connects customers, which consist of both consumers and merchants, to facilitate cashless, digital payment transactions. The Company offers its customers a technology platform to both pay and receive payments for goods and services, as well as to transfer and withdraw money. Consumers can transact with merchants and amongst themselves using a variety of services, including the Kaspi.kz Super App, a Kaspi Gold pre-paid debit card and/or any bank card or e-Wallet. In 2020, Kaspi.kz’s proprietary payment network transactions accounted for 66% of total payment network transactions in Kazakhstan, while other payment networks, including Visa and Mastercard, had an aggregate share of 34% of the total payment network transactions in the country. With close ties to Kazakhstan’s government, Kaspi.kz has also emerged as the country’s unofficial national online bank for paying taxes and fines, assuming a role that would otherwise be filled by the civil service or a government department, and further driving new user growth across the country. • Marketplace Platform connects merchants and consumers, enabling merchants to increase their sales and enabling consumers to buy a broad selection of products and services from a variety of online and offline merchants. The Company helps merchants increase their sales by linking them to its technology, payment options, including buy-now-pay-later consumer finance products, fulfilment, marketing and branding services. Kaspi.kz was the largest online retailer in Kazakhstan by sales value in 2020, with an e-Commerce gross merchandise value (“GMV”) share corresponding to 46% of the market. • Fintech Platform enables consumers to access, primarily through Kaspi.kz Super App, the Company’s digital finance products, including consumer finance and deposits. Kaspi.kz’s buy-now-pay-later consumer finance products are also strategically integrated with its Marketplace Platform, which means that consumers are able to make a purchase seamlessly with financing and then pay over time in monthly instalments. In 2020 the Company enjoyed the largest market share of Consumer Loans in Kazakhstan, amounting to 32%. Kaspi.kz’s Future • Kaspi.kz Travel. In 2020, Kaspi.kz acquires Santufei and launches online travel platform. Users can now purchase domestic and international flights from over 700 airlines through the app. Over time Kaspi.kz plans to expand into ground transportation, hotels and package holidays. • Speed and Risk Management. Credit decisions made in only 10 secs, and time to money 15 mins based on machine learning driven real-time decision making based on historic online data collected by Kaspi.kz and data purchased from third parties. The second type focuses on the client’s activity immediately preceding the application with the aim of assessing intent to buy. What client did on their phone one minute ago tells you a lot. These checks significantly reduced the risk of fraud. ATM network has face-recognition technology to detect fraudulent activity on the spot. Customers who entered their national identity number or displayed the QR code to the ATM could make any transaction without a plastic card. • Growth via the Merchant Segment. The merchant network gave Kaspi.kz another avenue for expansion. The company had daily contact with merchants, both online and offline. Around one third of all merchants’ sales were realized through its marketplace. It could easily provide services to its merchant base including payment services and capital financing tools. Capitalizing on its advanced analytical tools, the company was also able to provide merchants access to sophisticated marketing tools that they could not afford on their own. • Geographic Expansion. Central Asia and the Caucasus was a natural expansion area for Kaspi.kz. Russian was spoken throughout the region, and they shared a common culture. Mr. Lomtadze estimated that establishing a presence in any country in the region would take no more than 12 months because Kaspi.kz had a natural advantage: almost everything it offered was online in its mobile app, so they were able to enter the market with a marketplace or payments platform, which required no investment in physical outlets, posed no credit risks, and was not heavily regulated like financial services. Banks, on the other hand, would normally enter a market with loans, and they needed branches. Payments were also a tool for collecting customer data that then could be used for generating a credit rating for consumer financing decisions. “Our mobile app is like Uber,” Lomtadze declared. “Uber can scale around the world because of its simple onboarding process. In today's world, you don’t really need to own a fleet of cars to provide taxi services. By the same token, you don't have to have a showroom and a warehouse full of TVs to sell televisions. You can basically organize everything through technology and sell items via your mobile app.” o Azerbaijan was the first target. In the beginning of 2018, Kaspi.kz was eyeing a potential acquisition target in the country that owned three leading online marketplaces for—new and used items, cars, and real estate. Out of its 10 million citizens, almost half live in the capital city. That’s great for fulfillment. An acquisition here would expand target market from 18 to 28 million overnight. o For the same reasons Uzbekistan and Georgia attractive markets as well. • In terms of existing models, Alibaba is closest to Kaspi.kz in terms of the range of products it offers and its multiple contact points with customers. The company, in addition to its mobile app, captured customers in its outlets, ATMs, merchant shops, and retailers’ points of sale. Kaspi.kz had also been generating net profit for over a decade. Its net profitability was 43%, over seven times more than Amazon’s and about three times greater than that of PayPal. Baring Vostok, a private equity fund and a majority stake holder, had a long holding period; and recent IPO and subsequent lockup period would allow it to commence a formal exit. The subsequent lockup period ends on April 18th, 2021. Latest company's reports can be found here: https://ir.kaspi.kz/financial-information/ Not financial advice.
