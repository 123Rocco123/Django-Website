,"I have yet to see a good argument for buying one over the other. If anyone has read one, please post it here. From my seat, they operate the same but Visa seems more prone to larger price swings and is slower to recover than Mastercard. Other than the hedge funds owning Mastercard, I have not been able to find out why. Does anyone know? I trade MA and have a position in Visa, so I watch the price action closely.","V is bigger. They have more credit and debit cards issued with a Visa logo, thus handling more transactions.",0,0.506,0.739,NEGATIVE

Buy 1% V and 1% MA.Just like KO and PEP.VZ and T.,0,0.525,0.997,POSITIVE

There was an argument for growth, aggressive marketing strategies, and lots of deals for new cards. TBH I'm not sure how that all played out, and which company has larger international market share.I'm happy with V. I'll hold, and buy more. I would also likely be happy with MA.V is working with financial institutions to make deals that will eventually accept crypto.On the bearish side of things, there are rumors of regulatory crackdown on V for shady backroom, monopolistic practices. Rumors that they worked with PYPL and SQ in a way to squeeze out competition. Also on the bear side, that AMZN is removing Visa from prime purchases in Europe.I still like V, and I'll continue to buy more.",0,0.554,0.993,POSITIVE

Amazon eventually eats every partner, so once they learn from Affirm all they can, suspect they will chew them up, spit them out, and launch their own bank/credit card. I think this is the foreshadowing of what is to come.",1,0.51,0.997,NEGATIVE
