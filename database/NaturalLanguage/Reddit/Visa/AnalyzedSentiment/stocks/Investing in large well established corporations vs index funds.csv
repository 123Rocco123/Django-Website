And also because market growth tends to be driven by a handful of stocks (like 2 or 3) percent, while most stocks underperform the market. So your choices will probably underperform the market.The thing is, these companies can be great companies and be successful but underperform their prices. A great company is not that good to own-- and will probably underperform the market-- if it is priced like a great company. Buying index funds gives you a good chance at capital appreciation in the long run, and for the reasons I just said, probably a better chance than those big companies. On the other hand, index funds seriously protect your downside versus owning 10 stocks.Another way of looking at it: if you want to really outperform the market, it doesn't make much sense to choose a handful of US mega-caps, since their performance has a massive impact on indexes already. So if you expect them to do well, and you invest in the SP500, and you are correct that they will do well, you already caught most of that upside, just with much less downside.

It sounds like you get that. My issue is with number 3: picking profitable stong moat high growth business as a rule will not be highly successful. The reason is that companies like that are super expensive to invest in. People often think about investing in companies in a manner that divorces them from their price. Great companies are often not great investments. Even if they perform well as a company (which is easy to predict, as you say) it does not follow that they will perform well as a stock. The tech bubble from 20 years ago is a great example of that: Microsoft was a great company back then (and there was occasion to project it forward), no doubt, but not a great investment considering its price. Would you rather pay a PE ratio of 1 for texas roadhouse or 1000 for microsoft? An obnoxious example, but illustrative nonetheless: you're investing in a company for a price, not in a vaccuum, and the price you pay determines the quality of the investment, not the performance of the company.
