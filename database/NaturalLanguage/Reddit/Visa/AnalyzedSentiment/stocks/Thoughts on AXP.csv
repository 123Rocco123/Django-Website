,"Hi guys, First a disclaimer : I am a total newbie, so forgive me for the dumb questions. Couple of weeks ago somebody posted about AXP and why they believed AXP was a good company to invest in. I didn’t buy at the time but kept an eye on the stock. Since then the stock kept going up and I keep reading good comments about the level of service AXP is providing to its customers. P/E ratio is lower than Visa and Mastercard, Revenue and Margins are up vs 2023. Yet, when I look at analysts stock objective consensus on IBKR, I see the stock is already well above the consensus which I find confusing. So my question is : do you guys believe AXP still has room to go higher ?","Welcome to r/stocks!For beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our Wiki here.If you're wondering why a stock moved a certain way, check out Finviz which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see Reuters, and even Yahoo Finance.Please direct all simple questions towards the stickied Daily Discussion and Quarterly Rate My Portfolio threads (sort by Hot, they're at the top).Also include some due diligence to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They just follow the stock up and down anyways.If you are totally new, try broad ETFs first, then maybe get a feeling for it. You can always buy individual stocks afterwards.Don’t worry, best thing you did is starting early. Good luck!",0,0.56,POSITIVE,0.92

Saw the balance sheet and they do buybacks with share count going down.Growing business and dividends.The market use to value it at 10-15 PE because of the logic that they do processing and hold the loan balance like banks.While V and MA only do the processing.I was buying under $200.Also like how they focus on higher credit scores and not prime.If you like AXP, I also like and own AFL.AFL i got lucky and got some in the $30's after 2020, sold and got back in the $70's.",0,0.546,POSITIVE,0.984

Yet, when I look at analysts stock objective consensus on IBKR, I see the stock is already well above the consensus which I find confusing. So my question is : do you guys believe AXP still has room to go higher ?","""P/E ratio is lower than Visa and Mastercard""It's going to be consistently lower because it's a different business model with more risk. American Express is an excellent company, but it does extend credit which V/MA do not and so it does well when times are good but the moment when it seems like times might be starting to head South, people are going to start to worry about credit risk.People are going to worry more about credit risk at peers DFS/COF/SYF given the nature of AXP and its customer base, but credit risk is a worry for card companies that extend credit to people whereas V/MA do not - they are networks and the issuing bank (JPM with a ""Chase Visa"" for example, or whichever bank) is the one extending the credit. There is still the concern of volume in a recession/decline for MA/V, but that's imo easier to get through than credit risk in a downturn.""Yet, when I look at analysts stock objective""Don't rely on analysts.""do you guys believe AXP still has room to go higher ?""It's a good company, but I have no idea what the stock does in the short-term. IMO, every time someone invests in something they should have a thesis as to why. Inevitably the market is going to go through bumpier periods and having that thesis to go on makes holding something through difficult periods in the market easier and allows one to have an opinion on whether a decline is a good time to add. A lot of stuff that's bought solely because someone heard/read about it gets dumped when the market gets difficult and that often ends up as opportunities for other people.",0,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.999

AMEX is deeply ingrained into the payments network. You’ll be fine irrespective of when you buy it because the stock will keep going up unless there’s a massive lay off cycle.,0,0.54,POSITIVE,0.963

I would just plan for a long term hold, as credit card companies can be beholden to economic cycles and that cyclicality can cause underperformance if it looks like the economy is weakening. For me, it has crushed it and has a huge user base, but I prefer the payment processors in V and MA. Just the rails of payment processing and don’t have to take on credit exposure. Also axp has a smaller though still impressive network. I also think JPM is crushing the credit card game with offerings, and it is always competitive with points, miles, and cash back. Axp is always having to play that game, which v and ma are just the network for all the issuers that have to play that game (c, Bac, wfc, Barclays etc). I prefer v and ma but axp is a gold standard option as well",0,0.524,POSITIVE,0.987
