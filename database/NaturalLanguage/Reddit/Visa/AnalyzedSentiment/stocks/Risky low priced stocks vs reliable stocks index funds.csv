,"Which is better long term risky low priced stocks or reliable stocks Microsoft, Visa, Facebook, etc/index funds. I recently looked up this one company I thought of investing in last year in JYNT and it was 18 a share and went up to 100 now, so if I put 10k I would have had 50k now. Instead, I stuck with my index funds and reliable stocks like the ones mentioned above. However, most of the other small company stocks do not rise in value and a majority of them are value traps. Most of the low priced stocks cost low for a reason and are often value traps. Especially since coronavirus it's hard to find a stock under $200 now. So, if I do see one under 200 I either assume the company is in decline, bad management, bad fundamentals, or the company is more volatile. Even if these small companies do rise they seem to have huge variances and even if it 3x in value today, next year it could go down by half. Whereas, Microsoft and index funds will rarely drop more than 5 points in a day. Is there a low percentage of hitting the jackpot on these low priced stocks, and is it more realistic to stick with more reliable stocks and index funds? Or is it better to focus on smaller stocks at lower prices?","hindsight is 20/20. for every unicorn that catapulted someone to financial freedom, there're probably thousands who've lost money chasing the same types of company.unless you actually spend time reviewing financials, news, company information and market sentiment - you're more likely going to pick wrong than right. reddit doesn't count.it ultimately boils down to your risk profile and what stage of your life you're at. it's arguably easier to try these risky bets when you have a low NW/single as compared to a middle class/married individual since you have other responsibilities. these bets will be volatile, and if you're going to let emotion and circumstances influence your decision making, you'd be better off picking low risk funds 9 times outta 10.",0,0.533,1.0,NEGATIVE

Apple and AMD are both under 200 right now, so they’re bad companies? Your understanding of how stocks work is completely wrong. Looking at historical price movements and picking the one that went from 18-100 is a completely pointless exercise.",0,0.553,1.0,NEGATIVE

I’d have like 100k+ rn if I invested how I wanted. But I don’t. I missed a few really good opportunities. I invested 6k into GameStop. And sold when it started to tank. Then recently went to 260$ and I would’ve made like 25k off that. And another 15-25k off amc. If I just held On. But instead I lost like 5-6k all Together.,0,0.509,1.0,NEGATIVE

Momentum stocks tend to have higher risk, generate higher returns but can drop real quickly when the markets are in a downtrend. Low momentum stocks are much more stable but generate lower returns. The bottomline- Your returns (positive or negative) are directly proportional to the stocks you choose",0,0.523,0.997,NEGATIVE
