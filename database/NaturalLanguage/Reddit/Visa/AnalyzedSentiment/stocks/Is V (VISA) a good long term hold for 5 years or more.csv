,"Recently V and MA had a dip and of course I bought some. However I’ve seen many mixed feelings about VISA as many people thinks that other financial platforms like Square, PayPal, Affirm and possibly crypto payments will affect V/MA negatively in the long term. Here in Asia where I live, VISA is used most common everywhere, from grocery shopping to credit cards and online shopping. Pretty much everyone here use VISA or MasterCard for easy contactless payments even for our bus and train commutes. What are your thoughts on V/MA especially if one were to hold it for a few years? Did you buy the dip?","Yes great long term hold.Some people don’t realize companies like PYPL/SQ still utilize V/MA as their payment networks partner. I look at FinTechs more so as partners with V/MA and not competitors. Unless one of these companies wanted to start their own payment network directly.BNPL (like Affirm) could take some of the credit card business but I wouldn’t be surprised if some companies could start letting you even make installment payments via CC instead of direct ACH. I’m sure people even use their debit cards, which are V/MA brandedMy biggest concern is more regulation around payment networks and potential allowance of smaller networks to gain a piece of the pie. I read an article the other day how Australia may mandate low-cost debit card system for payments, which would allow banks to potentially utilize cheaper payment networks as opposed to V/MA (which are more expensive). I’m still not overly concerned with this yet to make me back off my stance that both V/MA are great long term holds, but something to watch.Once international travel comes back some post COVID, V/MA will shoot up as this is their bread and butter. That segment has still not really recovered yet from COVID and will be one of the last things that does.",0,0.519,0.894,NEGATIVE

The franchisees pay for the privilege of operating a visa franchise. The franchisee (like your local savings and loan, or chase or capital one, etc) uses the visa name and network, but they own the loan. That's the whole business. Hometown Bank Ltd pays Visa so they can have a Hometown Visa card, and they hope that all the cardholder debt earns them profit that exceeds what they have to pay Visa.So in the BNPL model, the debt is structured differently. The hope is to make money on the ""pay later"" aspect, with fees or charges or interest. It's sort of competitive to Visa/MasterCard's way of lending.",2,0.522,1.0,NEGATIVE

Now is possibly a good entry point to buy calls (or puts depending on your assumption). 2024 expiration will be available on the 13th if long-term interests you.Visa, as with many financial companies, has a weak negative correlation with long-term US treasuries. That means as interest rates fall, Visa's share price has a slightly increased chance of falling.For reason 2, Visa is a good investment if you believe interest rates will go up or if you own US treasuries and wish to hedge your position.Personally, I believe interest rates will continue to sink until job numbers improve enough for the FED to stop the money printer.",0,0.534,0.996,NEGATIVE

Did you buy the dip?","I don't know where do you live in Asia but I know that in China they never really used Visa/mastercard. They went straight from cash to mobile. Credit card payments is like 5% of payments. 90% is mobile that does not rely on Visa or MasterCard. AliPay and TenPay do not rely on Visa. Similarly, in India only 38% of people shopping online uses cards. Most people still use cash, but the transition is from cash to mobile, not from cash to cards.This is my opinion: I think the same will happen down the road in the West: it is bound to happen, because mobile is simply a more convenient system. And the China example shows that Apple pay or Google pay etc do not need the Visa system. I also believe that some crypto payment protocols like Ripple will get integrated in the banking system because they are just better, faster etc. So, who knows if Visa will be relevant 20 years from now. They are smart, they have a lot of money, but they will need to adapt, they are not safe at all.https://daxueconsulting.com/payment-methods-in-china/https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.alliedmarketresearch.com/mobile-payments-market/amphttps://www.jpmorgan.com/merchant-services/insights/reports/india",0,0.529,0.998,NEGATIVE

Pretty much everyone here use VISA or MasterCard for easy contactless payments even for our bus and train commutes. What are your thoughts on V/MA especially if one were to hold it for a few years? Did you buy the dip?","Both Visa and Mastercard are superb stocks... In my case i own only Visa, but i suppose either is fine... At these frothy valuations of most growth stocks, they are actually on sale. Just set a 5% allocation on either (or both) and believe me, you will be more than fine... Regards",0,0.527,0.827,NEGATIVE
,"Recently V and MA had a dip and of course I bought some. However I’ve seen many mixed feelings about VISA as many people thinks that other financial platforms like Square, PayPal, Affirm and possibly crypto payments will affect V/MA negatively in the long term.

Pretty much everyone here use VISA or MasterCard for easy contactless payments even for our bus and train commutes. What are your thoughts on V/MA especially if one were to hold it for a few years?

Did you buy the dip?","First: don't think of holding a stock for five years. They're like pets, you need to watch them every day. Your year five assessment should be done in year four.Now, regarding MA and V, they are poised for disruption. What they do is no longer that special. And their main customer base (vendors) hate them. When your customers resent you and would gladly replace you if anything equivalent comes along, that's a slippery situation to be in.They skim 2-3% off every dollar spent in the world. I'm shocked that someone big, like Google or whoever hasnt swooped in and said to merchants ""we'll do the same as them, but for 0.5%""Apple could have done it way back, but they chickened out and went conventional with Apple Pay.But someone will.Their stranglehold has been that customers are loyal and only carry visa or MasterCard. That's changing, rapidly. Consumers don't care. They could be using square or stripe or paysaafe or any of a hundred other payment processors. They don't care, they don't even carry plastic.All of that said, I would have made this same statement five years ago, and the MA/V juggernaught still hasn't been disrupted that much. I'm early.",0,0.553,1.0,NEGATIVE
