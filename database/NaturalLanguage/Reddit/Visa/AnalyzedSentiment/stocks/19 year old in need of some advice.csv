,"So, recently I started investing and I’m looking to create a balanced portfolio. I have already put a good amount into ARKK, ICLN, and QQQ. I have some remaining money but I am unsure what stocks would be the most beneficial to pick up. I currently have my eye on: AAPL, TSLA, SE, SQ, VISA, NIO, JD, and NVDA. Which out of these would you recommend would be the most beneficial given the ETFS I have already and are there any other good stocks that I should consider? Thanks in advance!","Those are all solid.Being young I’d favor TSLA, SQ, NIO. More upside IMO compared to the others.But the others are likely to be a bit more predicable and steady growth.",0,0.518,0.952,POSITIVE
