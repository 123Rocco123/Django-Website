,"Visa and Mastercard over the past ten years have averaged annual returns during this time of 30%+ They have had about 16-19 down months from the previous month in terms of share price since Feb 2012. And yes, a few of those were covid related. The only other comparable stock that is even remotely close is MSFT. They also had under 18 months of share price being lower from the previous month over the last TEN YEARS. Guys and gals, please build a portfolio of V, MA and MSFT. These three stocks are best and class but a mile. And no, Google, Apple, and others from my research are not as consistent over the last TEN YEARS or have 27%+ average annual returns. Does anyone know of any stock remotely close in terms of consistency AND returns? V average annual returns: 30.6% MA average annual return 32.6% MSFT average annual return 27.6%",There’s so much wrong with this I don’t know where to begin,0,0.51,1.0,NEGATIVE

I think they're good stocks, but they're richly valued and I think they'll face huge pressure from things such as Google/Apple pay etc.I'll get back in if they drop 15% or so",0,0.514,0.856,POSITIVE

Can you help me understand how Apple Pay negatively effects them? My Apple Pay is linked to my visa so they still get their % transactional fees. Same with my google pay.,1,0.506,0.999,NEGATIVE

But even so, I presume Visa and Mastercard take a much lower % cut than usual, with Apple/Google taking the majority.I also think Apple/Google will probably find a way to cut out Visa and Mastercard in the future and run their own transactions. They have so much cash available and need somewhere to invest it. I think payments processing will be a huge sector for them to invest in.But I wouldn't sell just because of that. Visa and Mastercard will be solid stocks for the next few years.",2,0.525,0.997,NEGATIVE

The issues are 1) oversimplification of the described methodology and 2) the statement that the described dynamics of these companies are unique among stocks.There are ample stocks with similar returns over the same period, and possibly other examples if you shift the period. You’d have to perform a holistic screen using a variety of metrics to even attempt this analysis - not chart stocks one at a time.Period chosen is arbitrary and by no means a benchmark. Both MA and V had IPO’s 2006-2008, so that alone calls into question what comparable period makes sense to use in context with other companies’ performance.Superlative assertions are made about volatility with no discussion of standard deviation. Superlative assertions are made about risk adjusted returns with no mention of Sharpe ratios. And then rather ironically, people who are accused of being rookies are directed to go look at charts, which is like the beginner version of analytics (technical analysis aside, but that is not what was described here).So no, this is not about disagreeing that these are “good” stocks to own. It’s about a lack of substantive analysis and an overly narrow conclusion that doesn’t hold up.And I mean no offense personally to the OP or anyone else. Just giving my opinion after I tried not to, but was subsequently and baselessly lumped into a group of clueless haters.",1,0.524,0.993,NEGATIVE
