,"Full Article Walmart Inc. customers will soon have the option to pay directly from their bank accounts with instant transfers for online purchases. The enhanced feature is a flash point in the escalating tensions between merchants and the card networks setting the fees for payment processing. The world’s largest retailer has offered pay-by-bank through Walmart Pay since earlier this year. Until now, the transactions were akin to digital checks and took roughly three days to finalize when being processed through The Automated Clearing House, the same network often used for bill payments or paycheck deposits. Soon, customers opting for pay-by-bank transactions will see the purchase reflected in their bank account balance instantly – and Walmart will receive the funds immediately. The consumer advantage of instant pay-by-bank over debit cards is avoiding stacked pending transactions. For customers carrying low balances, pending transactions can open them up to the risk of overdraft or non-sufficient funds fees from their bank, according to Jamie Henry, vice president of emerging payments at Walmart. In the US, most consumers carry credit or debit cards which offer convenience, fraud protections and, in the case of credit products, rewards programs.

TLDR/ Retailer partners with Fiserv for upgraded pay-by-bank option Aims at reducing consumer risk of NSF or overdraft fees","The walmart shopping experience is truly terrible, unrivaled and unmatched by any other retailer, and I avoid it as much as possible.So much stuff is behind glass which an employee needs to unlock for you, but there is never an employee to be found. One time I was trying to buy a camera and found an employee sitting on a stool in the electronics department and asked if they could get something and they just responded they can't, they are supposed to just sit there. There have been multiple times I go there with the intent of buying something and just give up and go elsewhere because I am literally unable to. Then if you can find an employee to give you what you need, you then have to endure standing in line for 10 min because there is only 2 open checkout lanes.The fact that they are cheaper for some things is the only reason I tolerate going there on occasion. If I can't use a credit card that would be the final straw, then I would see no reason to ever go there again.",0,0.514,NEGATIVE,1.0

I don’t think it’s as common as that person is making it seem.Also, this person is basing their entire basis on how bad Walmart is by how easy or difficult it is to get an employee to get something for you… I’ve been shopping at Walmart nearly every week to pick up things here and there for years and have never once had to stop and find an employee for something.
