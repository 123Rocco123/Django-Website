,"I know there are many recourses and answers online but I couldn’t find any non promotional informative ones. I’m an 18 y.o from Israel that made a relatively big hit from buying zoom in March and taking a little advantage of the oil future price drop. I have a capital of around 3000$ and I would like to continue trading (swing trading and long term investing) in stocks and maybe even options, but I don’t know any good non-us brokers that have 0 or a low commission. Until now I used my own bank as the broker but the commissions are insanely high (up to 10% per full trade). Does anyone have experience with this type of issue? I’m not looking into daytrading currently due to my small capital. I also tried td ameritrade but couldn’t open an account since i don’t have a us social security number or visa.",maybe trading 212?,0,0.522,0.989,NEGATIVE
