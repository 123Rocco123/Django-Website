,"Hey Reddit I usually lurk around here looking at discussions of certain stocks I'm thinking of investing it but I am in a special circumstance. I'm turning 18 in a month or so and am getting about 2500$ from a trustfund I also have around 1300$ in hand. I will be taking part in the army for 2.5 years so I thought I should invest the money so it can grow and pull it out at 25 or so so I have a good financial base to start with. I've been studying ETFs and individual stocks but have been hearing about a market crash from a lot of sources recently and also I've been looking at crypto since it's booming rn and isn't connected directly to the stock market. I understand that long term investments mean that you shouldn't be too worried about market dips. since Im probably going to be in for around 7 years I'm afraid the crash will affect me more since I don't have too much time to let the market recover but at the same time Might be waiting too long for a crash that wouldn't happen and miss the bull run gains. Is now a good time to get in? Should I wait for the crash and buy low or take the risk and get in now? I'm relatively new to the stock scene but have been studying the market for a few months, what do you think is the best option for me to invest in right now? (I am also contemplating between buying a few picked diverse stocks, a good ETF and dividend Vs growth).

The only real concern I have is that and since I'm not planning on getting a traditional job that offers a Roth IRA and am planning to retire before 35-40 years old so I will probably need access to the money there before 65 either way so I can use it for growing my income means only the money I put in Durning the 2.5 years can grow since I won't be able to continue to contribute to after the service.",3,0.539,1.0,NEGATIVE

BRS is the Blended Retirement System, which service members are automatically enrolled in if they joined in 2018 or later.

You'll get to contribute to the TSP as long as you receive a paycheck from the government, whether it be as a federal civilian or reservist (inactive reserve doesn't count).

I'd set up an automatic withdrawal/investment so that I could contribute money on a monthly/weekly basis into a low cost mutual fund. I had someone set up a mutual fund account for me when I was 18 but they got a commission, I didn't know, and it was a OK fund but had a 2% fee in total. I have fidelity account so I use their funds and there is no minimum balance or a minimum to contribute. Those make up the backbone of my account and then I pick stocks based on my insights/interests. I wouldn't let someone sell me garbage high fee stocks. I also wouldn't mess around with penny stocks. By the time you get out you may have a nice nest egg to start the next step of your life. This strategy won't make you rich but it should preserve and grow some wealth for you in that time horizon. You don't have enough capital to make $$$$ on dividends so you need a balance of growth and stability, and that's what you get with a S&P index fund.

,"Hey Reddit I usually lurk around here looking at discussions of certain stocks I'm thinking of investing it but I am in a special circumstance. I'm turning 18 in a month or so and am getting about 2500$ from a trustfund I also have around 1300$ in hand. I will be taking part in the army for 2.5 years so I thought I should invest the money so it can grow and pull it out at 25 or so so I have a good financial base to start with. I've been studying ETFs and individual stocks but have been hearing about a market crash from a lot of sources recently and also I've been looking at crypto since it's booming rn and isn't connected directly to the stock market. I understand that long term investments mean that you shouldn't be too worried about market dips. since Im probably going to be in for around 7 years I'm afraid the crash will affect me more since I don't have too much time to let the market recover but at the same time Might be waiting too long for a crash that wouldn't happen and miss the bull run gains. Is now a good time to get in? Should I wait for the crash and buy low or take the risk and get in now? I'm relatively new to the stock scene but have been studying the market for a few months, what do you think is the best option for me to invest in right now?

If you were holding for 15 years youd basically be guaranteed to make money, but 7 years you could definitely be lower when you pull the money. It's not super likely but it could happen. But your only real alternative is to hold the funds in cash and slowly lose value to inflation, it's up to you to decide what youd prefer.Also am I not better off investing in s&p500 or Berkshire Hathaway which are actively well managed and constantly add successful stocks and remove less successful ones?Investing in S&P 500 is fine but leaves you ever so slightly more vulnerable due to reduced diversification. It wont really make a difference in your situation though.Berkshire has actually underperformed VTI (another total market index fund with a longer history) over the last 5 years, and with VTI you don't get the idiosyncratic risk that comes with owning a specific company. Better returns with less risk.",2,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE
