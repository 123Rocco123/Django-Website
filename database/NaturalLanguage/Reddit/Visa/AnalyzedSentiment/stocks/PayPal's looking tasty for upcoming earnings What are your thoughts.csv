The missed revenue and money have to go somewhere in the fintech industry, so PayPal taking a bigger chunk of the revenue is very likely as well unless the entire fintech industry did badly as a whole, which would've been already priced in due to the recent industry sell-off.Not only that but because of lower expectations and sentiments after Square's bad earnings, it means that the downside is already priced in. Usually, during earnings, earnings from one very similar counterpart will affect the other in the same industry (for example, CLF earnings might affect MT, FSLY and NET would be another example in the past), but in this case, PayPal didn't fell much further after SQ's earning, which proves that it was already largely priced in.As you have mentioned, it is a lot more likely that even if they miss their earnings, it might rise instead. Let's be honest, for the hate it's getting in this subreddit, one have to admit that they're severely oversold and it was a huge overreaction, a 9 straight red candles with 11 out of 12 days being red isn't normal, especially when SP500 is hitting ATH days after days with the market rallying in general.Also, I believe they're not going to miss their earning reports due to the recent cryptocurrency huge rally, which PayPal is involved in largely as well.",1,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE
