,"AMD - monster year, they said they are increasing chips to account for XBOX and PS5's for the holiday season. I feel they have by far the highest potential growth for rest of year. Visa - Did not give expected earnings for Q4 bc of Covid which I'm not a huge fan of.. having said that similar to banks the closer we are to getting out of COVID/vaccines, the better stocks like this will perform. For the first ""normal"" Holiday season since the pandemic, I feel confident as well this will do strongly. GOOGL - they expected ad spending and holiday spending to increase for Q4, they had another fantastic beat and frankly I don't see any issues. Bizarre AH trading though MSFT - Will benefit from AMD's chip increase for the XBOX, the stock is a winner but I wonder the growth rate it will have for another quarter without any major announcements. Having said that, it could easily perform like a Costco and with another strong earnings just continue to power through. Overall I like all 4, but if I had to pick, I am probably going to invest more capital into AMD out of the 4.",Visa down because they didn’t provide guidance?! Cmon! Analysts and MM can’t extrapolate this quarter into what is clearly a “reopening world?!”,0,0.523,1.0,NEGATIVE
