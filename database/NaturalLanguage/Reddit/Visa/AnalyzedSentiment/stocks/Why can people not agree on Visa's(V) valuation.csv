They form the infrastructure of the payments system, have huge moats and make gobs of money.However, the market knows this and has assigned a high price for the high quality earnings of those companies.The fact that it has a high P/E ratio scares a lot of people. If you think it's justified, then it's cheap, or at least fair. If you think it's not justified, it's too expensive.Personally, I think P/E in isolation tells you very little and you might want a more comprehensive look at the stock to evaluate it.",0,0.535,NEGATIVE,0.762

Something like V will likely have a higher multiple because it's such a great business. If it always trade at 30x and now it's at 25x, it's potentially cheap (provided nothing has changed).I'm generally much more into business performance metrics though, ROIC being may favorite. Generally a company can grow at the rate it can successfully reinvest into the business. So a business that can do 20%+ ROIC for a long time can easily justify high price ratios. I'd much rather find a quality business than a cheap one.",2,0.554,NEGATIVE,0.933

Shit gets more expensive, other companies struggle. V/MC just continue to have their income increase on pace with inflation assuming all other metrics stay the same. But the metrics won't stay the same.A lot of growth still looms in developing countries. Just take a look at the boom in banking going on in Central America. EQ bank for example has made credic cards accessable to a population that was 80% unbanked. Huge growth potential globally still on top of being immune to inflation.On top of this they make more money on transaction for card holder who travel out of country and traveling has become extremely popular since COVID restrictions lifted.Ect ect ectEdit: I don't see how people can throw money at Tesla then turn around and call visa expensive...",1,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.976

There's a reasonable chance you won't. It looks like it's in some type of breakout pattern right now.

Most who say this probably also like tons of other stocks at this moment. I will tell you it's overpriced relative to a dcf analysis, even using its projected growth rates, when compared to A-rated corporate bonds. I will say the same for the vast majority of stocks in the US market.But also the data itself is variable. Some sites list 12 months EPS of $7.38 based on GAAP, while others go with $8.30 based on adjusted figures. If I take the $7.38 figure and do my own adjustment for the forward effect of the last year's share reduction, I get $7.45.",0,0.55,NEGATIVE,1.0
