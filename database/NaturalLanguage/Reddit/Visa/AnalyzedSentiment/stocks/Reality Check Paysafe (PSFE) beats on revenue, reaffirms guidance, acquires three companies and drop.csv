,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.

In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing.

We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else...

The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.

Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit.

A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal.

These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency.

Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.

They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter.

That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else...

We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors.

It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.

A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors.

It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.)

Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.

Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

They have first mover advantage and dominate in eCash and iGaming globally for a reason.

On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.

By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter.

That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

I think the large float is intentional to be readily accumulated by index funds and institutions due to their profile as a fintech that already has so much market share and does $100 billion in transactional volume.Regarding competition, see section on MOAT. They clearly differentiate themselves from competitors in iGaming, eCash, multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise and risk management.Debt is currently high but they just had their debt rating upgraded, successfully refinanced all of it at much lower rates and are on track to expand margins and cash flow to reduce leverage.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

You lay out all they’re doing to change that, but that makes them more of a restructuring or M&A play right now.That makes them, and it’s weird to say about PSFE given how established they are, more speculative than say a PayPal in a market that’s anti speculation right now. Add in a second layer, where nearly all despacs are getting beaten down as easy targets, and it’s not hard to see why the share price is struggling.I don’t have a position, but have watched them for a while and have considered buying in on the downtrend.",0,0.541,0.993,NEGATIVE
,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms.

Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales.

Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.)

Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

I agree that, because of the restructuring, it is somewhat more speculative. An interesting part of this is that Paysafe has multiple segments that can be considered stand alone companies, some of which would not seem speculative and could be reasonably valued independently at more than the whole company's current valuation.",1,0.551,0.554,POSITIVE
,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.)

Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book.

In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.

They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter.

That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

I mainly use PayPal and Apple Pay, and I basically buy whatever I want whenever I want, so why I haven't I noticed or needed PaySafe or any of its brands?The answer is basically that I don't gamble and I'm not involved in any ""direct marketing"" aka MLM schemes and similarly risky markets. That's where most of the company's volume comes from, per their Q2 earnings presentation. It also says they intentionally ""exited"" a number of direct marketing clients which shrunk that portion of revenue but their other non-gambling revenue grew 23% which more than made up for that. So that's a good thing, but...The overall pitch of PaySafe is that by starting out in grey market areas like iGaming and direct marketing, where PayPal and others won't go, they can build a large customer base which prefer their platform and have a balance in it. This gives them leverage to pry themselves into other non-iGaming markets where vendors will want to support a PaySafe method in order to reach their customer base.It's not an impossible plan, and it is laid out well, but I'm definitely not a believer. Money spent on gambling is generally lost. Most people who gamble are not richer for it. I don't see the gambling audience as a customer base from which to build a high volume ubiquitous payment platform.If payment processing for gambling suddenly became 100% legal, then Google Pay, PayPal, Apple Pay, and every other payment system that every consumer already has at least 1 account for will support it and all these ""PayPal but for <shady thing>"" companies will have a bad time.",0,0.549,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.

July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

There's quite a bit more to it than that however. Look into Paysafe Unity and it's potential.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.

Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit.

A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels.

Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.

By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter.

That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.

July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.

Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit.

A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming.

Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics.

That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

Almost every division has new leadership. New CEO since 2019. New CFO since last year. New Board of Directors since last quarter. Significant ongoing restructuring and de-risking. Looking at the history of Paysafe, they've have been undergoing dramatic change throughout their evolution so, can any one experience define the company now? Aside from last year, they managed to grow 30% CAGR so they know how to execute without burning the house down. With it trading at this level combined with their US iGaming and Latin American prospects, I don't see a lot to worry about.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.

July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services.

July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.

Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.)

A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network.

Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book.

Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem.

When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.

This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.)

Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

It’s just hard for me to sell when every call I listen to and everything I read leads me to believe that they’re becoming better & better every day.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit.

A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics.

That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid. July 13 — Paysafe adds 20 new digital currencies to its digital wallet and expands this service to 11 new US states, bringing US presence to 48 states. July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.

July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

PayPal, by comparison, seems to have been caught a little flat footed. Paysafe also divested from their buy now/pay later business because they saw regulatory risk increasing. Meanwhile PayPal is entering that space and suddenly eliminating late fees which seems a little suspect. With regulatory changes in Europe, Paysafe was also able to quickly shift their data mining out of that market while expanding those tools elsewhere like North and South America. This is a complex space and these guys have been at the forefront of this kind of regulatory risk assessment in so many different countries for long enough to see where the ball is going in advance.",3,0.533,0.605,NEGATIVE
,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.

These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book.

Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.

By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter.

That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.

It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.

By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.

That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator...

He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else...

We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors.

July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.)

Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.

If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

According to their FAQ, they became exercisable on August 21st. They have the usual provision that warrants can be called if the common shares trade at $18 or above for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period. That doesn't seem likely for a while, but they also have this provision, which confuses me, since it basically just overwrites the $18 over 20/30 days one:""Additionally, once the public warrants become exercisable, the Company may call all such public warrants for redemption at a price of $0.10 per warrant when the price per share of our common shares equals or exceeds $10.00.""So doesn't that make you think as soon as they hit $10 they'd call them in?https://ir.paysafe.com/stock-information/warrants-faqs",0,0.543,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

The cashless conversion rate at $10 is 0.26 so if they were to call warrants then, they'd be worth a minimum of $2.60 each which still has significant upside from here. I think the company has a lot of incentive to not call warrants until they are well above $18, however, because warrant holders will be much likely to go the cash conversion route. This would bring in hundreds of millions of dollars. Something like $600 million actually which can go a long way towards M&A or deleveraging. Below $18 cashless conversion makes more sense for warrant holders but no money for company.",1,0.553,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 14 — Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution July 19 — Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants. July 20 — Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe’s Income Access July 21 — Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable ‘banking-as-a-service’ solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe). July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

They've recently added many new accounts but it's not clear if that will translate to a lot of revenue. Ultimately they still have to compete with other lenders and trading platforms. I prefer Paysafe as a long term play because it's more diversified and positioning itself as a global player in many key verticals. I especially like what they are doing with eCash and the potential 'unbanked' market. Unlike SOFI, they are currently profitable and generating a lot of cash, which they will accelerate and which I believe the market will favor going forward. I'm sure they'll both do well but I personally see a bit less risk with Paysafe. GL!",1,0.533,0.611,POSITIVE
,"Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%. But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech. Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.” To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion. They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs ~ $105 billion) So why the miss? Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news. On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news: Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter) 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture) 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV) Revenue growth in all segments eCash revenue +37% YoY (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries) North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits) Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage. Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.” Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.) With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America. Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost. Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.” This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV. Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1. Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.” These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality. In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance. Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. Paysafe vs PayPal Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine."" The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow, Paysafe’s share price would be $32. A 4x gain from current levels. Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider: PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.) On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY. With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe. Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR). PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60 Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt). During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR. Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%. There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32. Some Background: Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies. Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.” Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.” Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries. MOAT: Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.” “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” iGaming Expansion Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.” In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage. As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting” Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.” Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”: ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering"" ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature"" “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign"" ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting"" ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting"" “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL"" “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year” “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling” “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting” “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear” “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools” “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal” “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think” “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada) Consistent Value Creation: Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors. In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities. Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in: Dec. 15 — Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments Dec. 21 — Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform Dec. 23 — Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers Jan 11 — Paysafe partners with Colorado’s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform Jan 13 — Paysafecard launches in Moldova Feb 1 — Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform Feb 17 — Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services Feb 18 — Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world’s largest esports company Feb 23 — Paysafe’s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service Feb 25 — Paysafe partners with Austria’s A1 esports League Feb 25 — Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models Feb 26 — Paysafe wins “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution” 2021 MPE Award Mar 1 — Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash Mar 4 — Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for “Best Payment Method” Mar 12 — Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\ Mar 15 — Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan Mar 16 — Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases Mar 18 — Paysafe announces new Board of Directors Mar 19 — Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta Mar 25 — Paysafe’s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase April 1 — Paysafe’s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook April 15 — Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador April 21 — Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022 April 27 — Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers April 29 — Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring May 17 — Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving May 20 — Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US May 26 — REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments June 1 — Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth June 2 — Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe June 3 — Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market June 7 — Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments June 23—Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash June 29 — Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan June 30 — Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox July 8 — Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best ‘Affiliate Software Supplier’ July 8 — Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.

July 26 — Paysafe’s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair & Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe’s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel. July 27 — Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe’s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership Aug 2 — Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe’s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE’s Q4 top line a solid boost. Aug 4 — Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe’s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. ""Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe’s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks."" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe’s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.) Aug 9 — Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor Aug 10 — Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division Aug 16 — Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% Aug 16 — Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay Aug 22 — Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech M&A / inorganic growth: Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.” Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.” Valuation Metrics: Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal. A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. - Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow. - By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow. - Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them. The group's collective growth rate of ~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming. Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels. In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth. Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers: Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100 EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average : $46.52 In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.
