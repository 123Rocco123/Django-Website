,"(Not english speaker, sorry) I never was really interested in the whole fintech sector. I obviously know visa and MasterCard and paypal etc by using their services. But what differentiates them, why couldnâ€™t one make the other obsolete and which MOATâ€™s do they have?",Visa and MC are a collection of banks who make a consumer payments to retailer group (C2B or consumer to business).PayPal is an independent company for payments first for C2C (while owned by eBay) and then C2B.Adyen is a payments company used by retailers like eBay for C2C processing.,0,0.576,0.924,POSITIVE

But what differentiates them, why couldnâ€™t one make the other obsolete and which MOATâ€™s do they have?","Sorry for the delay, and I'll caveat this with ""my information is limited combined with I don't know what I'm talking about"" to keep from getting into trouble.VISA/MC/Discover/AMEX are payment card processors making money from the transactions. We're talking 2-4% typically, which is their profit margin (and it's mostly a convenience fee that gets charged to the merchant) which reduces what I would consider upside to profit. Plus they lose money with promotions (e.g. AMEX gains through their partnership with Delta, but someone pays for the Skymiles).Would I invest? No. I'd prefer to go with a dedicated financial firm like JPM, WFB or other Fintech).PayPal, Stripe, Square, Coin and other tech based C2C solutions have a low threshold for entry and also high compliance threshold. When you go global, you encounter problems with compliance in foreign countries (or risk being blocked).Would I invest? DependsPayPal? No. There are no strong moats protecting them even as they continue to buy companies (e.g. Venmo), versus WFB rolling out Zelle.About 10-years back I sent a message to the CTO of PayPal telling him to make the move towards becoming a financial institution. This would allow them to hold money, and to trade in a variety of other assets (e.g. equities or BTC before anyone really was into it). It was ignored, but the compliance hoops covering this would have taken years and put them into a stronger position than today. But for C2C payments? No moat plus other countries (EU) use wire transfers or (China) Alipay.Walmart and Western Union still transfer billions due to remittances sent to countries like Mexico from the US, taking a cut. But direct payments to someone's bank is equally as easy if you know how to shop.For example, there's a new UK based company called wise (wise.com) which allows you to hold and send money internationally even, with very good arbitrage rates and the cheapest cost to transfer money. They lay out why and how they're the best which makes it easier for people to see how much they can save by transferring money through them.Would I invest in them? Yes.Adyen and other payments processors for C2B ... it's a struggle for many companies and I'll use eBay as an example. They had the source code prior to their split with PayPal back in 2015 (and a contractual limit as to how soon they could enter the payments space) and still have been unable to fully deploy a payments solution on their back-end, utilizing Adyen. Companies like FB and GOOG try to create their own wallet and poaching people from different companies because it really is a challenge.Would I invest? Yes, once they're embedded with a platform.",2,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE
