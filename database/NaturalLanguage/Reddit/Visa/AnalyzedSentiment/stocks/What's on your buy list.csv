Tesla, Samsung, Panasonic aren’t exactly tied to lithium markets, and they’re consumers of lithium more than they’re producers, meaning rising prices will hurt them more than help. Those companies account for 25% of the ETF, and that’s just off the top of my head and without researching any of the other holdings I don’t recognize on the list.The lithium spike is currently happening around the world, but the documented commodity price is tracked based on sales in China. If you want a pure play lithium company with direct exposure to the Chinese market, but you want it to be an American company, LTHM is your play. See my post history (most recent post) for DD on the connection between LTHM stock and lithium prices. It only covers until the last day of 2021, but the gap between the price of lithium and LTHM stock has gotten WAY wider this month.",2,0.551,1.0,NEGATIVE

They’re also a good pure play, as their sales are mainly in China where the commodity price is measured. Lithium sales in China made up 60% of its 2020 revenue, and prices in 2021 are now up more than 400% since then. Their earnings results for Q4, due out sometime second half of feb, should be pretty eye-popping, even compared to stronger expectations.ALB’s largest production site is in Nevada, but it’s also not purely a lithium company.LAC and LIACF are pre-revenue companies whose main sites will be in nevada, with smaller chunks of their revenue coming from operations in Argentina. (If you go to LAC investor relations and look at its price projections under full production capacity, those numbers are generated using a lithium price of USD$12K per ton, which is less than a third of what lithium prices have now spiked to.)",2,0.547,0.53,POSITIVE
