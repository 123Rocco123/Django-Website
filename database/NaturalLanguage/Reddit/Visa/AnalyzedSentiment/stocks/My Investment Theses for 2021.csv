,"Spent a couple hours thinking and writing out brief theses for all of my current positions. I follow news and financials, but these are more internal thoughts I had moving into positions. This exercise definitely helped flesh things (positive and negative) out and gave me things to think about. I think it's something I'll be doing at year-end on an annual basis moving forward as well as exit comments on all positions. I am open to risk and my portfolio reflects that. Thoughts and criticisms appreciated! Investment Theses - Dec 1, 2020 ARKK ETF: Technology is expanding and compounding at a rate that is hard to keep up with. The same can be said of many of the primary holdings of ARKK. These are companies that have benefited the most from how quickly the world is changing today as well as how the stock market landscape in general is changing. CLOU ETF: Cloud computing is becoming more and more relevant as businesses are relying more and more on big data to optimize their businesses. While this sector has received a bump from the COVID-19 pandemic and may level off for a time, I see it as a catalyst to a sector that isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. QQQ ETF: The Nasdaq has exploded over the past decade, far outpacing the S&P 500. This is the technology age, and those changes are just starting. TAN ETF: As we push into the 2020s, solar energy (and other forms of clean energy) is something that is finally starting to be looked at seriously. With the massive amounts of infrastructure to be laid and work to be done, this industry won't be slowing down anytime soon. AMZN: I mean, it's Amazon. BAC: Huge financial institution with a long history that will be propped up by any means possible. Bank of America and other financial institutions were hit particularly hard by the drop in early 2020 and should have some further upside. This is more of a short-term idea as investors seem to be somewhat rotating back into value plays. DIS: Disney is currently at a crossroads - they have the opportunity to break into the streaming revolution that is taking over the world, and they seem to be doing far better than anyone thought they would be. With a huge amount of IP, Disney has the capacity to rise to the level of Netflix (while not being a direct competitor) at a much quicker rate. Add into the mix their parks and retail side, and we should have great growth and a stable rebound moving into 2021 and beyond. T: AT&T has obviously bungled their way through the DIRECTV acquisition while taking on a lot of debt to acquire it along with Time Warner. On the plus side, they've been able to effectively manage and bring their debt down due to continually strong cash flows. It remains to be seen whether they can shake off the nightmare that has been DIRECTV and capitalize on the shift to 5G as well as HBO Max. V: Credit and debit cards are far from ubiquitous in the US and even more so in other areas of the world. Visa remains the company to beat in the space. CRSP: The secret to the future of medicine lies in CRISPR (gene editing) technology. If this technology can be harnessed in the way it is imagined, the potentials are without end. The technology is still in the nascent stages and will undoubtedly face many delays and challenges along the way. This combined with the fact that CRISPR Therapeutics is not guaranteed to come out on top in the sector (although they are well-positioned) makes this is still a speculative but somewhat safe play. DKNG: Betting on outcomes in life is something that the average person does every day. Throw sports, money, and easy accessibility into the mix, and you have a perfect storm. DraftKings already has a strong presence in their fantasy lineup pools. Now states are dominoing to legalize online sports betting as not doing so will lose them out on a lot of taxes as people cross state lines to place their bets. 2021 will see an explosion in the sector. FUBO: A synergistic investment with DKNG, fuboTV is the ultimate streaming platform for all things sports. They've spent the past several years building up quite the library and consumers have no problem shelling out $60 a month in order to access it. As ESPN bleeds under DIS, consumers will flock to the streaming service that provides all of their sports needs: fuboTV. One of their most interesting ideas is how to work live sports streaming in conjunction with sports gambling. LULU: The king of athleisure, Lululemon is here to stay, and it's safe to say that lines that come out of Lululemon stores even during the pandemic show just that. Sound financials throughout 2020 and seem to be poised to come out of the pandemic in a better position than they were in before. It will be interesting to see how they leverage their acquisition of Mirror. U: You can mine for gold or you can sell pickaxes. While gaming might not quite be a gold rush industry, it has shown a lot of solid and steady growth over the past decade, and we are starting to move into the next generation of gaming. This growth will continue as more and more of Gen Z get older. Unity is well-positioned but will need to see if they can capitalize in the upcoming years. VRYYF: A very small Canadian plant-based meat company that had its IPO in mid 2020. The products are great and in line with the growing population of vegetarians and vegans. Their demand is currently too high, and they cannot ship product in a timely fashion to consumers. They've acquired several new plant locations that could show huge expansion in their production as well as the US market. It remains to be seen whether that spike in production will be met with the same level of demand, which is what the current astronomical valuation is based on. Highly speculative and volatile but still viewed as a long term hold if demand surges YoY.",solid list IMO,0,0.507,0.999,POSITIVE

States without legal sport’s betting are missing out on a ton of money at a time where state financials look grim.I like Disney too and I could see them competing directly with Netflix, especially as we see movies move straight to streaming devices. NFLX is at an interesting spot because they don’t have many current movies but do a good job of producing their own shows.

While I think this biases our opinions a little, it's hard for me to see the bear side here. I think once the train gets going, it's not going to stop. Their biggest threat I would say is FanDuel, but I think DraftKings has the edge here, and there's no reason the two can't coexist.Speaking of coexisting, I think Disney+ and Netflix ultimately can coexist for the time being. I think they address different markets as Disney+ is based on Disney's IP, so you don't have the debate over ""should I get Netflix or Hulu (also Disney haha)?"" Those two I think are more seen as interchangeable. When Disney+ inevitably starts upping their subscription costs, I think that's when we'll see if they are trying to compete directly with Netflix. Anyways, the fact that we are back to similar valuations from pre-Disney+ leaves me thinking there's a lot of room to grow once their other revenue streams are back to pre-COVID levels/Disney+ continues expansion.",1,0.514,0.996,NEGATIVE

CLOU ETF: Cloud computing is becoming more and more relevant as businesses are relying more and more on big data to optimize their businesses. While this sector has received a bump from the COVID-19 pandemic and may level off for a time, I see it as a catalyst to a sector that isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. QQQ ETF: The Nasdaq has exploded over the past decade, far outpacing the S&P 500. This is the technology age, and those changes are just starting. TAN ETF: As we push into the 2020s, solar energy (and other forms of clean energy) is something that is finally starting to be looked at seriously. With the massive amounts of infrastructure to be laid and work to be done, this industry won't be slowing down anytime soon. AMZN: I mean, it's Amazon. BAC: Huge financial institution with a long history that will be propped up by any means possible. Bank of America and other financial institutions were hit particularly hard by the drop in early 2020 and should have some further upside. This is more of a short-term idea as investors seem to be somewhat rotating back into value plays. DIS: Disney is currently at a crossroads - they have the opportunity to break into the streaming revolution that is taking over the world, and they seem to be doing far better than anyone thought they would be. With a huge amount of IP, Disney has the capacity to rise to the level of Netflix (while not being a direct competitor) at a much quicker rate. Add into the mix their parks and retail side, and we should have great growth and a stable rebound moving into 2021 and beyond. T: AT&T has obviously bungled their way through the DIRECTV acquisition while taking on a lot of debt to acquire it along with Time Warner. On the plus side, they've been able to effectively manage and bring their debt down due to continually strong cash flows. It remains to be seen whether they can shake off the nightmare that has been DIRECTV and capitalize on the shift to 5G as well as HBO Max. V: Credit and debit cards are far from ubiquitous in the US and even more so in other areas of the world. Visa remains the company to beat in the space. CRSP: The secret to the future of medicine lies in CRISPR (gene editing) technology. If this technology can be harnessed in the way it is imagined, the potentials are without end. The technology is still in the nascent stages and will undoubtedly face many delays and challenges along the way. This combined with the fact that CRISPR Therapeutics is not guaranteed to come out on top in the sector (although they are well-positioned) makes this is still a speculative but somewhat safe play. DKNG: Betting on outcomes in life is something that the average person does every day. Throw sports, money, and easy accessibility into the mix, and you have a perfect storm. DraftKings already has a strong presence in their fantasy lineup pools. Now states are dominoing to legalize online sports betting as not doing so will lose them out on a lot of taxes as people cross state lines to place their bets. 2021 will see an explosion in the sector.

On the plus side, they've been able to effectively manage and bring their debt down due to continually strong cash flows. It remains to be seen whether they can shake off the nightmare that has been DIRECTV and capitalize on the shift to 5G as well as HBO Max. V: Credit and debit cards are far from ubiquitous in the US and even more so in other areas of the world. Visa remains the company to beat in the space. CRSP: The secret to the future of medicine lies in CRISPR (gene editing) technology. If this technology can be harnessed in the way it is imagined, the potentials are without end. The technology is still in the nascent stages and will undoubtedly face many delays and challenges along the way. This combined with the fact that CRISPR Therapeutics is not guaranteed to come out on top in the sector (although they are well-positioned) makes this is still a speculative but somewhat safe play. DKNG: Betting on outcomes in life is something that the average person does every day. Throw sports, money, and easy accessibility into the mix, and you have a perfect storm. DraftKings already has a strong presence in their fantasy lineup pools. Now states are dominoing to legalize online sports betting as not doing so will lose them out on a lot of taxes as people cross state lines to place their bets. 2021 will see an explosion in the sector. FUBO: A synergistic investment with DKNG, fuboTV is the ultimate streaming platform for all things sports. They've spent the past several years building up quite the library and consumers have no problem shelling out $60 a month in order to access it. As ESPN bleeds under DIS, consumers will flock to the streaming service that provides all of their sports needs: fuboTV. One of their most interesting ideas is how to work live sports streaming in conjunction with sports gambling. LULU: The king of athleisure, Lululemon is here to stay, and it's safe to say that lines that come out of Lululemon stores even during the pandemic show just that. Sound financials throughout 2020 and seem to be poised to come out of the pandemic in a better position than they were in before. It will be interesting to see how they leverage their acquisition of Mirror. U: You can mine for gold or you can sell pickaxes. While gaming might not quite be a gold rush industry, it has shown a lot of solid and steady growth over the past decade, and we are starting to move into the next generation of gaming. This growth will continue as more and more of Gen Z get older. Unity is well-positioned but will need to see if they can capitalize in the upcoming years. VRYYF: A very small Canadian plant-based meat company that had its IPO in mid 2020. The products are great and in line with the growing population of vegetarians and vegans. Their demand is currently too high, and they cannot ship product in a timely fashion to consumers. They've acquired several new plant locations that could show huge expansion in their production as well as the US market. It remains to be seen whether that spike in production will be met with the same level of demand, which is what the current astronomical valuation is based on.

,"Spent a couple hours thinking and writing out brief theses for all of my current positions. I follow news and financials, but these are more internal thoughts I had moving into positions. This exercise definitely helped flesh things (positive and negative) out and gave me things to think about. I think it's something I'll be doing at year-end on an annual basis moving forward as well as exit comments on all positions. I am open to risk and my portfolio reflects that.

The same can be said of many of the primary holdings of ARKK. These are companies that have benefited the most from how quickly the world is changing today as well as how the stock market landscape in general is changing. CLOU ETF: Cloud computing is becoming more and more relevant as businesses are relying more and more on big data to optimize their businesses. While this sector has received a bump from the COVID-19 pandemic and may level off for a time, I see it as a catalyst to a sector that isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. QQQ ETF: The Nasdaq has exploded over the past decade, far outpacing the S&P 500. This is the technology age, and those changes are just starting. TAN ETF: As we push into the 2020s, solar energy (and other forms of clean energy) is something that is finally starting to be looked at seriously. With the massive amounts of infrastructure to be laid and work to be done, this industry won't be slowing down anytime soon. AMZN: I mean, it's Amazon. BAC: Huge financial institution with a long history that will be propped up by any means possible. Bank of America and other financial institutions were hit particularly hard by the drop in early 2020 and should have some further upside. This is more of a short-term idea as investors seem to be somewhat rotating back into value plays. DIS: Disney is currently at a crossroads - they have the opportunity to break into the streaming revolution that is taking over the world, and they seem to be doing far better than anyone thought they would be. With a huge amount of IP, Disney has the capacity to rise to the level of Netflix (while not being a direct competitor) at a much quicker rate.
