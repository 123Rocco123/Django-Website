GM/Chevy/Ford would never have gotten to this point because they source batteries from others and therefore played no role in advancing battery technology. They just looked at what batteries were available on the market and tried making the best out of it. Essentially they were chronically a few years behind where modern tech should've been.Musk designed Tesla to be vertically integrated specifically so they'd be making their own batteries to reduce cost and allow them to maximize the efficiency as much as possible. On top of all that, they created a national infrastructure of charging stations.Before Tesla there were way too many obvious disadvantages to owning an all-electric car for your average consumer to even consider it.

Many of them sponsored electric car teams and their execs were well aware of the technology.I think it comes down to flaccid corporate leadership that is afraid to take any risk, goaded on by pension funds and Wall Street types who wanted to treat their dividend as an entitlement program.GM and F are probably going bankrupt.
