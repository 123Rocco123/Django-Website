Thanks!","Markets are like an auction where the price of any stock is equivalent to the value someone will pay to purchase vs. the value someone is willing to sell.For stocks trading near 52-wk lows, that means some shareholders have a cost basis above the current price and they may want to do some end-of-year tax loss harvesting. They have until 30 NOV to sell in 2021 and repurchase after the 30-day wash sale restriction have expired. So, that could put downward pressure on the stock price in and of itself.Add on top of that the potential (still TBD, but the market hates uncertainty) for a mutated version of COVID-19 that needs a reformulated vaccine to prevent spread and that could put downward pressure on the entire market.Tread lightly friend.

Disney and Paypal are great companies, I've been surprised how badly Paypal has been doing the past month or so after the Pintrest rumors. Same with Visa; stocks like these have been taking a beating but are fundamentally great companies that haven't performed well this year; their due for breakouts. I love Sofi. The stocks close to their 52 week highs are all gems. I recently took profits on AMD and Nvidia since both have gone on solid runs, but took positions again in both because their just too good. Apple and Microsoft; can you really go wrong with either? I've been buying more Apple recently since it hasn't performed that great YTD, expecting a solid run soon.

Thanks!","The best thing to do, even better than asking if a bunch of ramdom redditors think your choices are wise, would be to determine for yourself if the valuation of these stocks is around where they should be.Look at the P/E (Price / Earnings) ratio. Is it in line with other similar P/E for securities in the same industry? If the P/E is like 50-100 or more, do you believe the company is poised or a lot of growth and/or profit in the near future?Look at revenue and earnings for the most recent quarters. Look at how the stock’s price over those quarters. Is the stock’s price up like 80% over the last few quarters but their revenue and earnings are maybe only up ~10%? That might mean investors believe there will be a lot of growth or profit coming in the near term but it also (probably) means the company is overvalued.Also look at EPS (earnings per share) and how that has changed over time compared to the stock price as well as the EPS for other companies in the same industry (or sector).That is just the tip of the iceberg. The thing that really sucks balls, IMO, is that the stock prices for many companies (especially the stocks mentioned on reddit) don’t necessarily move in a way that reflects their valuation. i have lost a lot of money because of that.But I still believe looking at the data and learning about the company is really the best thing to do because, well, otherwise you just have speculation and opinions from people who may or may not know what they are talking about or that have their own agenda, and that isn’t a smart way to invest.I have also been paying attention to what moves institutions are making with the stock. I use whalewisdom.com although I have honestly no idea how accurate the data is but it has helped me more often than not. I have found that when like 80-90% of a stock is owned by institutions the price basically seems to go up because there is typically little selling day to day. But when they do sell then the price tanks because so much is being sold at once.The only real advice I would give regarding your stocks is to consider which companies are profitable and which are not. The companies that are not profitable - you will see all kinds of arguments from thousands of retail investors as to why X company is the next big thing, will be worth 10x in a year, etc. it is all noise. All of it. All those people have a position and their own agenda in that they don’t want to lose money. Anytime someone says “to the moon” they lose any and all credibility IMO. I think that every company I have looked into that isn’t profitable and will likely not be for at least a few years and have seen quick gains in their stock price due to hype have all eventually tanked. Short sellers will almost always get the best of these stocks and rightfully so.",0,0.561,0.999,NEGATIVE

I'm less thrilled with some of your other pics like Apple that are still very close to their highs.But with either strategy, I have to tell you that this is a very challenging environment at the moment to invest for the long term. I lived through the dot-com bubble crash. Every stock in my portfolio, good solid companies with products that people loved, dropped more than 50%. The only way I was able to survive that was to continue to dollar cost average over the coming years. Just continually put more and more each month into the market by taking whatever I had left from my salary and investing it.I truly believe that we are in a massive bubble, and that bubble will burst in the next year or two. Heck, it might burst in the next month or two. There are a lot of signs of weakness in the market, in particular, all those growth stocks that did so well in the early part of this year, almost all of them have lost far more than half of their value. That is the sign of a type of a crash.When the DOT COM crash happened, it was the high flying growth stocks that got hit first. It took 8 months of those stocks crashing horribly before the market started selling off the big blue chip stocks. If this market starts coming after Apple and Amazon, look out below because the whole market is going down.",0,0.554,1.0,NEGATIVE
