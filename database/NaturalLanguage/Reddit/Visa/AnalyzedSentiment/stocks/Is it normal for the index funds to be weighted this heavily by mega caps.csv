Pretty normal since many funds weight by market cap so the top market cap companies with be the same across indexes.How normal is it for a handful of large cap stocks to so heavily make up a huge chunk of total market cap?

Is this historically the case, or is the market too dominated by mega caps right now to have a difference?","Yup, it's pretty normal for major index funds like QQQ (which tracks the NASDAQ-100) and VOO (which tracks the S&P 500) to be heavily weighted towards mega-cap stocks. This is because these indices are market-cap weighted, meaning companies with higher market capitalization (like Apple, Amazon, Google) have a larger representation in the index. Historically, it's common to see overlap in top holdings of these funds, especially as tech giants have grown in dominance. However, the extent of similarity can fluctuate over time.I don't think it is necessarily a sign that the market is too dominated by mega-caps, but rather a reflection of the current economic landscape where these companies have a substantial impact. The composition and dominant sectors can shift. In the past, industries like energy, financials, and industrials have had periods of significant representation in these indices. This shift just reflects the evolving economy and market trends.",0,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.98

Is this historically the case, or is the market too dominated by mega caps right now to have a difference?","No, it isn't. The S&P 500 is more concentrated than it has ever been. Over the last 35 years, the average weight of top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 index has been 20%. During the dot-com bubble, the combined weight of top 10 stocks peaked at 25%. At present, the figure is over 30%.“One of the most obvious features of divergent market action during 2023 was the concentration of speculation in a handful of glamour tech stocks (the “Magnificent Seven,” comprised of Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, and NVIDIA). Strikingly, the capitalization-weighted S&P 500 Index outpaced the equal-weighted S&P 500 by more than 12.4% in 2023. Same stocks, just different weighting. This has easily been the primary headwind for hedged equity strategies in the past year.This sort of divergence is also a regular feature of extreme market peaks. It’s easy to forget that bubbles typically end with frenzies in “blue chips” or “performance stocks.” At moments like the present, it’s important that investors remember.

I believe a lot of other posters have relied on the indexing 101 answer to this question which is mostly true, but ignores the ahistoric levels of concentration in the S&P 500. Also as pointed out, this often does not end well as people overpay for great companies.

Is this historically the case, or is the market too dominated by mega caps right now to have a difference?","Yes, if you want to buffer this for some reason or take a different approach by an equal weighted fund of the same index, or own both of them so that the equal weight fund balances off some of that front end weight.",0,0.508,NEGATIVE,0.998
,"For reference, I have positions in both QQQ, VOO, and an American Capital Group Index Fund. I looked at the top 10 holdings of each and they were all very similar: META, AMZN, Alphabet, AAPL, NVDA, Broadcom, and MSFT. The 9th/10th places were different in all of them, with one being salesforce, one having Tesla, one being UnitedHealth. Another fund had Costco, one had Visa, and I don’t remember the other. However, my question is how “normal” is it to have these large cap funds to have 7 or 8 of their top stocks be the same?
