,"Hello Traders and Investors! An exciting week ahead of us, here is my weekly newsletter which I share every Monday to help prepare you for the week! Feel free to DM me and happy trades! Week of 4/26/21 The S&P500 opened Monday 4/26/21 at 4185.03, above the previous close of 4180.05 on Friday 4/23/21. Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand. Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...[take] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware. The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles. The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders earlier this month to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia. Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC has announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap. The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reports earnings on Wednesday. Analysts are looking for the technology giant to post earnings of $0.98 on revenue of $77 billion after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year last Wednesday, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. Microsoft will report earnings Tuesday. Analyst estimates place earnings around $1.78 per share over $43 billion in revenue. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector. Executives from Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube will testify before a U.S. Senate Judiciary hearing committee on Tuesday. The executives have been called to testify on the use of algorithms to dictate what consumers watch and read on the popular platforms. The hearing comes amid concerns that manipulative practices have led to massive distribution of misinformation, with repercussions that reverberate throughout society. The practice of purposefully serving consumers misinformation has been dubbed “algorithmic amplification,” and the results of the hearings could have a significant impact on the social media industry. All three companies will report earnings this week. OPEC will hold its opening session Wednesday. The conference will take place over the course of the day, and will include remarks from prominent Russian and Saudi chairman. The conference is meant to be informative and expected to feature little remark on policy. However speculation that additional information on a potential NOPEC bill could have an impact on U.S. trading. The conference comes one day before North American oil giants Exxon and Shell report earnings. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30PM Wednesday. Powell’s recent statements at press conferences have highlighted an economy which although largely recovered, still faces a degree of risk in the face of the pandemic. Powell stated in an April 11th CBS interview, “The principal risk to our economy right now really is that the disease would spread again more quickly.” Powell’s comments come a day before advanced release of the Q1 U.S. GDP, which Bank of America analysts predict will show a real growth rate of 6.5%. Some of the Companies with Earnings this Week Monday, April 26th: Among others, Tesla (TSLA) will hold earnings calls today. Tesla looks to top analyst estimates of $0.75 EPS on $10.5 billion in revenue after a successful quarter for delivery numbers in the face of the ongoing chip shortage.

The demands are high, so for someone who doesn't have that much knowledge inside investments and barely getting her feet wet in it, would it be wise to invest in it?",0,0.513,0.994,NEGATIVE

The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap. The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reports earnings on Wednesday. Analysts are looking for the technology giant to post earnings of $0.98 on revenue of $77 billion after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year last Wednesday, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. Microsoft will report earnings Tuesday. Analyst estimates place earnings around $1.78 per share over $43 billion in revenue. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector. Executives from Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube will testify before a U.S. Senate Judiciary hearing committee on Tuesday. The executives have been called to testify on the use of algorithms to dictate what consumers watch and read on the popular platforms. The hearing comes amid concerns that manipulative practices have led to massive distribution of misinformation, with repercussions that reverberate throughout society. The practice of purposefully serving consumers misinformation has been dubbed “algorithmic amplification,” and the results of the hearings could have a significant impact on the social media industry. All three companies will report earnings this week. OPEC will hold its opening session Wednesday. The conference will take place over the course of the day, and will include remarks from prominent Russian and Saudi chairman. The conference is meant to be informative and expected to feature little remark on policy. However speculation that additional information on a potential NOPEC bill could have an impact on U.S. trading. The conference comes one day before North American oil giants Exxon and Shell report earnings. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30PM Wednesday. Powell’s recent statements at press conferences have highlighted an economy which although largely recovered, still faces a degree of risk in the face of the pandemic. Powell stated in an April 11th CBS interview, “The principal risk to our economy right now really is that the disease would spread again more quickly.” Powell’s comments come a day before advanced release of the Q1 U.S. GDP, which Bank of America analysts predict will show a real growth rate of 6.5%. Some of the Companies with Earnings this Week Monday, April 26th: Among others, Tesla (TSLA) will hold earnings calls today.

Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand. Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...[take] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware. The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles. The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders earlier this month to address the issue.

,"Hello Traders and Investors! An exciting week ahead of us, here is my weekly newsletter which I share every Monday to help prepare you for the week! Feel free to DM me and happy trades! Week of 4/26/21 The S&P500 opened Monday 4/26/21 at 4185.03, above the previous close of 4180.05 on Friday 4/23/21. Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand. Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...[take] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware. The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles. The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders earlier this month to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia. Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC has announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap. The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reports earnings on Wednesday. Analysts are looking for the technology giant to post earnings of $0.98 on revenue of $77 billion after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year last Wednesday, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. Microsoft will report earnings Tuesday. Analyst estimates place earnings around $1.78 per share over $43 billion in revenue. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector. Executives from Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube will testify before a U.S. Senate Judiciary hearing committee on Tuesday. The executives have been called to testify on the use of algorithms to dictate what consumers watch and read on the popular platforms. The hearing comes amid concerns that manipulative practices have led to massive distribution of misinformation, with repercussions that reverberate throughout society. The practice of purposefully serving consumers misinformation has been dubbed “algorithmic amplification,” and the results of the hearings could have a significant impact on the social media industry.
