What do you think?,"I think you’re less likely to find this in duopolies where it seems like competition but there isn’t price competition. Coke/Pepsi compete but not on price, which I would argue isn’t full body contact competition. I think you need to go to markets where there are many players with undifferentiated products, switching costs are low, and they compete on price. This is where you’re more likely to find true full body contact competition.Just spit balling here but I’d say something like commodities - like ore miners or something. Something like BHP vs Vale vs Rio vs Glencore (I don’t know this space well so just throwing names out there, sure I got a little wrong). Another example is airlines, well, maybe airlines in the 90’s in the US when we had like 6-10, probably too few now.",0,0.515,0.985,NEGATIVE
