,"Global travel screeched to a halt during the pandemic, and it’s hurting credit card companies’ bottom line.  American Express, Mastercard and Visa all reported double-digit drops in profit for the recent quarter, compared to a year ago. The companies pointed to a plunge in international travel as borders remain closed during the pandemic.  Visa was the latest major card company to report results on Wednesday. Cross-border transactions fell 29%, while Visa’s revenue in the quarter was down 17% from a year ago. The company did not give guidance based on uncertainty around the virus, but said the cross-border weakness remains a “significant and continued drag on revenue growth.” That will likely continue into 2021, according to Visa’s CFO Vasant Prabhu.  “The cross-border recovery has been sluggish since borders remain closed, and there are significant impediments of crossing borders like quarantines and other such restrictions,” Prabhu said on a call with analysts Wednesday. Visa rival Mastercard reported earnings Wednesday, with many of the same themes. Mastercard’s net income fell 28% year over year, and net revenue fell 14%, missing analysts’ expectations. The company reported a 36% drop in cross-border volumes, and did not forecast a rebound in travel spending anytime soon. Shares of Mastercard have fared the worst in the past week, and are down 11% this week. Visa and American Express are down 8% and 10% this week, respectively. Amex kicked off the card earnings on Friday with a 40% drop in profit from a year earlier. Travel and entertainment spending was down 69% year over year. While the company is “highly confident” that travel demand will return, “it will take a while,” American Express CFO Jeffrey Campbell told CNBC in a phone interview.  Source",I agree.
