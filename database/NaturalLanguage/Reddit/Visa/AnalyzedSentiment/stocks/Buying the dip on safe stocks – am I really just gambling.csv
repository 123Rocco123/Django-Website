,"Obligatory intro: I've started investing this year and made a happy sum on GME, while also (almost) losing an equal amount on BB. I was lucky enough for BB to briefly pump in June and made it out without becoming a bagholder. I promised myself never to blindly buy into doubtful stocks or at least put in any sum over 1% of my portfolio. Over time, I started putting money into ETFs and blue chips – my portfolio is now happily 68% SPY, Apple, and Microsoft. However, I still catch myself dumping money into stocks that have dipped strongly (recently: NVDA, HUBS, PYPL, VISA, MSFT), thinking that they will recover—eventually. I've managed to get a nice return on MSFT doing this a few months ago, but I'm currently in the red on the others and it's causing me anxiety thinking that I'm just gambling and I threw my money down the toilet. Is it somewhat safe to say that these ""safe"" stocks will rebound eventually or am I just deceiving myself that I'm investing?","It should be noted, nearly EVERYTHING is red right now. Don't torture yourself with the poor performance of a couple bets here or there when the market dips. It's a pretty safe assumption that the market will inevitably go back up - you may not know how or when, but being well-positioned for the ups is all you can do right now.My advice: ignore the ups, ignore the downs. Invest a dollar value you can afford, along a timeline you're prepared to wait, and revisit your investments sparingly between now and then.",0,0.525,0.998,NEGATIVE

Is it somewhat safe to say that these ""safe"" stocks will rebound eventually or am I just deceiving myself that I'm investing?","I think MSFT is the strongest one given it has multiple growth angles going on. Starting to muscle in on cloud, workflow automation, team productivity stuff, which are all very tangible and then some speculative stuff built in with metaverse.A lot of the AAPL buying pressure is people considering it to be a safe haven/always go up company, and that always leads to bursts of volatility. But in the long run it should continue to grow/make the right business moves.NVDA valuation is pricing in a lot of expected revenue from metaverse stuff we don't know if it's going to turn out well or not, so that is speculative. They do have some tangible stuff going on there with Omniverse's beta, it just depends on if you believe it'll be widely adopted.PYPL and V are a little tough to call because we're talking about the overall secular trend - if we go a decade out, are they going to be growing still given how much disruption is happening in fintech?They are big enough players to buy their way. But they're such huge companies it's hard to judge ahead of time - you buy a small new fintech company growing revenue 40%+ year after year, but your main business is seeing slower growth. In theory they are a bit more robust in an inflationary environment, but that's a separate thing and might be less important compared to the fundamentals of their growth.PYPL's growth was around 18.5% from 2015 to 2020, before competition from Square really started to intensity. But they are still growing. To me it's about how many plays they got in their toolbag. So similar moves to offering Venmo as a payment option in Amazon -> ok. There's a lot of ecommerce companies popping up across the whole globe so if they keep doing that with say MercadoLibre, with Canoup, etc, they can keep finding ways to bolster their activity and adoption rates, embed themselves everywhere.So I kind of look at it like their presence and sheer size means they will likely have a place at the table with all these growing ecommerce giants in Asia, South America, etc. I think, in theory, they grow with ecommerce sector, and their scale helps them there vs. perhaps the smaller less proven fintech companies. Digital payments is a big enough market people should be fine with accepting a tradeoff between having a piece of that market share and reduced CAGR -> it's a matter of if the institutions see it that way too.",0,0.539,0.992,POSITIVE

IMO they could be the king of wearables for decades to come, the Apple Watch has a lot of associated health related patents (imagine if the watch can measure temps, blood sugar), and their AR tech could be a huge new revenue stream as well. They’re also diversifying into many service revenue streams.Not to disparage MSFT I agree they have plenty of growth opportunity, I think AAPL does as well too.",1,0.544,0.998,POSITIVE

In fact, when everybody else was betting on Virtual Reality, Microsoft instead bet the house on Augmented Reality. It started with HoloLens 1 and continued with HoloLens 2. They know that Apple is gearing up for AR, and obviously Meta. Google will probably also get in the mix at some point.Microsoft also remembers just how much they lost out on, by not capitalizing on the smart phone revolution. They have vowed to not allow the same mistake to happen again. With Meta and Apple betting so heavily on this technology, it only emboldens Microsoft's early convictions.I'm not saying that Microsoft is going to win the AR Wars, but I'm just saying, don't sleep on them.

Meta and Apple actually have a very difficult road in front of them, because they're 100 percent consumer facing with their efforts. Microsoft by choosing to tackle enterprise instead of consumer, they can keep their prices high (and their margin), and also try to perfect the technology before being forced to miniaturize it too much for consumer appeal. Meta and Apple will be forced to make many concessions to make their AR glasses ""acceptable"" to be worn in a Starbucks or grocery store.Magic Leap started off as being 100 percent consumer focused on AR, and quickly realized that consumers didn't want to pay 3K for an AR headset.

Maybe this information was already priced in because big players expected it? Maybe this new piece of information is actually new, is negative, but there's another positive indicators that compensate for it so things go up anyways?You gamble when you don't have all the information, playing black jack at a casino is gambling only because you can't see the dealer's deck and full hand, if you could you would not longer be gambling. When it comes to the stock market it's the same thing, you're playing a game against millions of players, they all have different mindsets, strategies, access to information, capital, etc and you have no fucking way of knowing any of that, so even though you might make some smart plays and end up winning most of the time it comes down to luck. Granted, you do win over time if you're patient because unless you're buying shit stocks they kind of eventually go up, but that doesn't mean you're making smart plays based on lots of information, it's mostly winning because you're the house and the house always wins in the end (assuming you're holding good stocks).",2,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE

Buying into individual stocks (there are hundreds of worse ones you could be considering honestly) necessitates doing more than a cursory look at the company’s financials; knowing the competitive landscape and differentiators is really important. That’s why it’s better to invest in industries you know very well (or learn about), because then you’ll know better than most why a company may do better than a competitor, or that its real estate holdings are more valuable than may be reflected on their balance sheet, for instance. Companies and CEOs will always make everything sound great, so you have to be able to scrutinize. This also can inform whether or not you invest more in the future—or just hold.And if you get into a situation where it makes sense to cut losses, make sure you research what signs you may have missed in the beginning, so you can look for those in the future.Also consider that if you’re complacent invested in certain megacap names, it’s likely that everyone else is, too. And the valuations for Apple and MS, while not nearly as high relative to many other speculative stocks, are arguably stretched right now. So also consider if the present is a good time to buy. Being patient and deliberate on entry will greatly increase your chances of coming out ahead.",0,0.533,0.823,NEGATIVE

If it feels like gambling to you then treat it as such.But it's not like you're buying random penny stocks here. Nvidia aren't about to go bankrupt.I'm bag holding a couple of things right now. But they're things I have conviction in. And there's no reason for their price drop beyond the market being shit right now.
