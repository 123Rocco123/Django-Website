,"Hey All, In recent weeks I saw a lot of posts regarding PayPal. Often there was answers like â€žwhy would you buy PayPal over Visa, Mastercard or Amex?â€œ. Now I was wondering what the generell sentiment here is about AXP. Do you see a heavy downside because companies like Apple are going to establish their own payment processing? Do you think this could hit companies like AXP and V hard? I am very curious what this sub thinks about the current situation and the outlook for a long term investment.","Welcome to r/stocks!For beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our Wiki here.If you're wondering why a stock moved a certain way, check out Finviz which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see Reuters, and even Yahoo Finance.Please direct all simple questions towards the stickied Daily Discussion and Quarterly Rate My Portfolio threads (sort by Hot, they're at the top).Also include some due diligence to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This makes their moat weaker as they had to foster a two sided system, but since they have done this and 80%+ of the largest merchants accept them, they are the leading APM by far and do still have a MOAT, especially with Braintree captive nature and P2P flow in.For AXP though, they are a bit like V/MA in that they charge fees, but they have their own bank and sponsor their own cards meaning they retain the loans. The problem with Amex rn is that as the sponsor and retainer of loans, they are using all of their fees on rewards and promos to retain and attract customers, meaning the capital light element that make visa and MasterCard so profitable isnâ€™t present as much because all of the merchant fees go towards rewards and Promo. As a result, all profitability is derived from the credit card loans on the balance sheet. Of course they are much better than any bank as they originate all the loans for little cost as it is covered by merchant fees and they have in house origination analytics meaning they can sell the loans they underwrite or retain them and get very attractive returns on that high interest rate debt ðŸ’¸!",0,0.515,0.604,POSITIVE

However if you look at what Google (and others) have done, they've effectively piggybacked off Visa/Mastercard networks. In a lot of cases you need to have a card linked to your Google wallet/apple pay etc.I do think that card requirement may change in the future (although not sure how exactly -prepay is possible).So I think AXP might struggle more than V/MA.",0,0.508,1.0,NEGATIVE

I imagine itâ€™ll work similarly to Apple Pay where you still have a card linked to it but if they decide to go their own route it could be dangerous for payment companies.Not to mention blockchain which if apple/ google/ Amazon ventured into payments and adopted a faster processing system (blockchain) it could really lead to trouble for some.Although the big payment players are already looking into blockchain / using it in some cases. PayPal just launched a terrible stable coin that hopefully gets no traction.,0,0.513,1.0,NEGATIVE

I suspect you are referencing the built in ability to freeze, burn, rescind, etc. user tokens? Not something I am overly excited to hear about initially, but I don't see how they could allow their stable coin to be used within their standard transactions with buyer protection otherwise. Is there something else I'm missing?",1,0.518,1.0,NEGATIVE

Itâ€™s not your money if someone can take it or freeze it whenever.There are other solutions but they have control this way so they go the CBDC route.Thereâ€™s no need for it anywhere.
