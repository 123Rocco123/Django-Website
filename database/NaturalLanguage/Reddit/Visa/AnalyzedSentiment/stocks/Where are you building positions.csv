,"I have a very small portfolio, about 14k. Over the last few years I lost a very, very substantial amount of money as a % of my portfolio making stupid trades. Mostly trying to be too cute with long dated call options that went terribly in the wrong direction and expired worthless, credit spreads, chasing some WSB tickers. Basically trading like I'm in a literal casino. The last 18 months or so I've mostly gotten back on the right track and have been building positions in the big names that have been traditionally good bets over a long horizon. Google, apple, Amazon, meta, tesla, Microsoft, Nvidia, visa, you get the idea. I recently started a new job and can comfortably put $1000 a month into the market to chase some growth while equally contributing to my savings. Something nearly all of these companies have in common is that they are all hovering at or near 52 week highs and while I'm not entirely deterred by that it gives me some pause. Personally my next thought is to build a bigger position in the s&p and nasdaq indices over the next few months since I'm currently concentrated in individual companies. Beyond that I'm looking into different oil / ng etfs because I don't have any exposure there. Just curious where other people stand with the run up on some of these more popular large caps and where you're currently looking to get exposure",I have unreasonably large positions in SE and NET.

Sea has also turned profitable recently after years of losses which pleases shareholders. Forrest Li seems to be a savvy CEO who's done right by his employees giving them raises - not necessarily something that pleases share price - but he's getting these things out of the way before additional growth. They've done a good job recently prioritizing share growth over entering markets that they were spread to thin.,2,0.537,0.972,POSITIVE

I only allocate 10% of my portfolio into individual stock selection.My reasoning is to mainly protect my wealth rather than growing it in a more volatile way. The path I take is one where I accept that it does not lead to extreme generational wealth, but it would guarantee a comfortable retirement. My entire stock picking portfolio can go to $0 and I can still have a safe retirement. If my stock picking portfolio does extremely well, then I’ll have a bonus on top of my retirement. I would urge you and others to consider your income, future income , savings rate and all other factors to build a portfolio around.",0,0.547,0.861,NEGATIVE

Most traders (not investors) have recency bias, they have been trained over the last year to think that a run up will be followed by a correction. They could be right, but they could be wrong and we might be in the midst of a gradual run up, in which case they will miss possibly a year of gains before they realise.If you are picking individual stocks I can see how you would be more hesitant.
