I agree it seems to be a great buisness, with little overhead. The profit margin is fantastic. But I buy stocks to make money, and 38% over 5 years is not what I consider a great pick. VOO did nearly 80% over the same time period. I'm thinking about selling this one.",0,0.565,NEGATIVE,1.0

VOO EPS has grown about 7% annually while it's multiple have grown 6% annually. Multiple expansion/shrinkage is where the difference in return happened (nothing to do with the fundamentals)This why it's a buy at the moment because their buybacks will now impact the EPS growth more (because of the cheaper multiple) and I can't see their multiple shrinking the same as the past 5 years nor do I see VOO's growing at the same rate.,1,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.865

And that's not even getting into the outrageously high transaction fees it has.As for a ""digital dollar"", what the heck is that supposed to be? Credit cards and other payment systems like Venmo already give you all the benefits of a digital dollar, and have a well established user base.",1,0.515,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"We all know the company, many of us have their cards in our wallet. Very stable business in a sector that really only has a handful of competitors (MA, AXP, DFS).

All you are doing is making people think rocket lab is solely a meme stock that only dumbasses on Reddit will pitch in irrelevant discussions because they are so desperate for others to join and gO tO tHe MoOn!!!You making these cringey comments is not doing a single positive thing for the company. You are actively hindering it by making people think it’s not a serious investing opportunity to get into. Your comment gives off pathetic and desperation vibes, not informative or intriguing.This isn’t wallstreetbets, stop acting like a clown.",1,0.535,NEGATIVE,1.0
