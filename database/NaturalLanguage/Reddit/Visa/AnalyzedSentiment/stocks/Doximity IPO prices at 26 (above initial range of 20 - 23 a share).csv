,"(Crossposted and slightly modified due to audience, from r/residents as DOCS was being offered to physicians) I'm a new here but since I see some posts about it, might as well start with this. I'm a physician in California, 20 years out from residency. I've been investing with my Stafford Loan $ since MS I and endured several serious market crashes. I enjoy doing financial analysis and have successfully invested in multiple IPOs in the past, including google, mastercard, visa, interactive brokers, and evercore financial. I still HODL GOOG, MA, and V; sold EVR at a modest profit and roughly broke even on IBKR. This is completely divorced from what I think about the app or the company (I don't like the fax function, don't usually read its articles, and primarily use it so that when I call patients they can't see my mobile #), I am focusing purely on the financials reported by the company. I would be interested in seeing if anyone else has picked up anything that I have blind spots for and cannot see. Thanks in advance. tl;dr: DOCS hits every thing I want to see in (any) company going public. I committed a full 250 share allotment on Fidelity after I had passed on an opportunity to purchase pre-IPO shares through EquityZen First. The S-1 filing is located here. Second, Their financials. For any company you want to look at: Revenue (also called 'top line') Operating Expenses Profit (also called 'bottom line') which is more or less revenue - expenses Cash on hand Debt Why they are going IPO You want to see that the company is making money both top line and bottom line, you want to see that their costs are not outstripping their revenue and profit growth. When you are investing in a stock, you are basically laying an (educated) bet that the company will grow their profits. When they grow, your stock grows. For the last bullet, you want to see that they have money so that they won't go bankrupt. Generally for why IPO, if the prospectus says, ""to pay back debt"" or ""the company will not receive any proceeds"" then stay the hell away. You want the company to use the money they raise to fund new ventures or anything that will help them grow. So, under the hood (and very simplified): 2019 2020 2021 Revenues 85.7mm 116.4mm (+30.7%) 206.9mm (+78%) Expenses 67.9mm 79.3mm (+16.8%) 122.4mm (+54.3%) Profit 7.8mm 23.5mm (+201%) 57.7mm (+145%) What do we see: Increasing rate of change growth in revenue from 2019 -> 2020, and 2020 -> 2021 Increasing expenses but rate of change is not as much as rate of change of revenues Profit every year. Though 2020 - 2021 growth is not as much as 2019 - 2020, it's still more than doubled DOCS has 142mm in cash on hand, and the only ""debt"" they have is in the form of convertible preferred stock - i.e. no loans taken out. Why are they IPOing? They are going to use the funds to support growth and investments in the business, or to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or assets. In Summary. Solely from a financial perspective, the company grows revenues and profits year over year. Their expenses are growing but not as rapidly - plus if you dive into their S-1 they have a significant portion of those expenses used for research and development, which in my mind is actually not an expense but more of an investment in their future. They have cash on hand and no debt. It's a slam dunk and I am not surprised that the IPO priced 3 dollars above their upper range because everyone with financial know how and the ability to get their hands on the stock wanted it. Cheers and best wishes. Obligatory not financial advice, do your own research, I like the stock, etc. etc.",Iâ€™m a Physician. Doximity is a joke.
