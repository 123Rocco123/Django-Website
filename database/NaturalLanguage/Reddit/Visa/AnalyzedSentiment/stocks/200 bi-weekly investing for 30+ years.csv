Many of the same companies are in QQQ, VTI, SCHD, and VOO. You could just hold VTI and have the same returns. you are missing international exposure, if you care about that.My long term ETF portfolio is mostly VT (total world), plus VYM (dividend ETF)Remember, if you are holding a sector specific ETF like QQQ, then that means you are trying to bet that tech will outperform the rest of the stock market over your time horizon. While that may have been true for the last 20 years, it absolutely may not be true for the next 20. That's why I don't hold QQQ in my long term portfolio.you might as well not bother with individual stocks at this point. all the ones you bought are fine companies, but your ETFs hold them as well.Having a bunch of different redundant ETFs and individual stocks in your portfolio can make things more confusing and complicated for no reason.Do you really think VISA is going to outperform the overall stock market over 10 years? If not, then there really is no reason to buy VISA individually.Just because you use something every day, doesn't mean it is a good stock to buy.
