,How you think the digital euro is going to affect visa and mastercard? Since 70% of all digital payments are currently being used by their network and sole purpose of digital euro is get rid non-eu company (=visa and ma).,"I’m not an expert on this subject but I would have thought it would effect Visa, Paypal etc badly.From what I gather the whole point of CBDCs are to put the power back in the governments hands rather than the banks and payment processors. Correct me if I’m wrong but isn’t most of the circulating money right now on banks balance sheets and not actually in physical dollers like it used to be?Therefore the banks hold the power with regard to expanding the money supply via loans etc.",0,0.509,NEGATIVE,0.997

While they would definitely disrupt the business model massively, the likelihood of a wide adaption of digital currencies is unlikely at the moment. They offer little upside to using the systems that are already in place and often have big restrictions on then because of fears of money laundering. In my opinion, as long as those digital currencies don't offer some actual upsides for a majority of users, they probably won't be widely accepted.That being said, the whole payment market is becoming more and more difficult with new technologies and new competition. Visa/Mastercard/PayPal definitely hold huge portions of the markets and have network effects, but things will likely become more difficult in the future.",0,0.543,NEGATIVE,1.0
