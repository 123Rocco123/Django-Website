,"Context: Hi Guys, I'm an 18-year-old, holding dual citizenship in Germany & the US, and currently live in Australia on a visa. I recently got access to a relatively large sum of money which I want to invest in a Multi-asset ETF like AOA. I was looking into turning this into a Roth IRA to begin contributing to my retirement and of course get tax-advantages. After some research, I've concluded that I don't yet qualify for a Roth IRA (as I don't earn enough and haven't paid enough taxes to the IRS), and due to the limited nature of my Visa the superannuation funds' Departing Australia superannuation payment (DASP)'s high tax rate of 35-45% I would literally lose money if invested it into my super. Now my question: Are there any tax-advantaged accounts provided by countries or banks that could be an alternative to a (Roth) IRA in my situation?","US tax laws apply to US citizens no matter where they live. If you really want to keep your citizenship, you should play nice. Or, if you don't care, you can always renounce it.",0,0.516,0.986,NEGATIVE

Iâ€™m not talking about not paying taxes to the IRS, but rather finding further tax-advantaged accounts such as for example the Superannuation fund here in Australia to which I have access.
