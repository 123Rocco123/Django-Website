,"I'm looking the near the money put call spreads for VGT (info. tech. ETF ) and I'm noticing that the puts get significantly mores expensive in relative terms for Aug 21 then for July 17th or Nov 20. Does anyone have a clue why that is? Edit: I'm thinking of relative spread as the difference between the two divided by the average of the two. I'm thinking in terms of relative spreads because difference exercise dates have different price regimes. My guesses VGT has apple, microsoft, visa, intel, etc. and maybe people expect earnings to be way down for that time period for that sector. why? VGT is way over price by some standard, and there is a lot of hedging. What standard? the liquidity for the calls and puts for that market is low and creates lots of noise. lots of volatility and lots of liquidity which might is causing prices to go a little wacky. Granted there is a lot of over between some of my guesses, but anywoo was wondering what you guys thought.",I have no goddamn idea what you're talking about but I will just say that August IV on VGT is not meaningfully higher than November.,0,0.518,1.0,NEGATIVE
