,"I'm working from this guide from Investopedia. Net Investment: To support growth, companies need to keep investing in capital items – including property, plants and equipment. To calculate this net investment, we take capital expenditure (found in the company’s statement of cash flows) and subtract non-cash depreciation (found on the income statement). I'm using Visa's financial, and while i can find the Capex and PPE, i can't find any depreciation... Whats up with that? Should i just use an estimate, like 3%, or no depreciation at all?","Sooooooo i should just use an estimate lol...I was using 3%, got worried i was doing it wrong, and scrapped all my work.I think i'll try again with MSFT",0,0.506,1.0,NEGATIVE

There’s a lot of variables at play when it comes to that calculation, so I would shy away from generalizing like that.
