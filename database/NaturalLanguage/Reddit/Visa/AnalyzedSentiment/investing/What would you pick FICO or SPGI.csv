,"Am looking to add a high quality Financial Services stock with solid fundamentals and a wide moat to my portfolio and am interested in FICO and SPGI. Although both are different companies, am going for a high quality name for the long term. Say 10 yrs and up. What are your thoughts on these 2 names? Would you pick any of these? Or something else? I already hold Visa, PayPal and SoFi in this space.",Go for Mastercard with these valuations. FICO and SPGI are awesome companies but I feel like they are on the higher end of valuation. Mastercard is selling at historically low metrics. I expect to make a consistent 15% a year from MasterCard but you never know,0,0.545,0.736,POSITIVE

You could always diversifyPaypal/Sofi are too risky to me, who knows if they recover",0,0.535,0.999,POSITIVE

They seem like a dinosaur in the fast moving credit score space (I work in underwriting for a major credit card company). I’d avoid for that reason alone but I’m admittedly unfamiliar with their financials.,0,0.543,1.0,NEGATIVE
