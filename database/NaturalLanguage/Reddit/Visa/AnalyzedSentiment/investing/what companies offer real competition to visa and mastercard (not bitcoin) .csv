,"would it be paypal (venmo)? If thats true, then it means its a return to cash because people would essentially pay for items using venmo without going through visa or mastercard's network. I'm not convinced thats even a threat.","You see payment apps equivalent to Venmo/Cashapp/Paypal in Asia that have really taken hold. For example, small street vendors are unable to take direct card payments, but an increasing number now accept direct payments via mobile payment apps.I am not sure whether this model is applicable to more developed countries in the West. I can potentially see an expansion of Apple Pay/Facebook Pay to support direct consumer to firm payments without using debit/credit cards.",0,0.514,0.954,NEGATIVE

,"would it be paypal (venmo)? If thats true, then it means its a return to cash because people would essentially pay for items using venmo without going through visa or mastercard's network. I'm not convinced thats even a threat.",ApplePay will never be huge because of platform lock-in.For some perspective: iTunes for Windows is their most important product to date because it finally uncoupled their mobile devices from Apple computers.,2,0.53,0.989,POSITIVE

Amex and Discover (more-so the former), but yes it’s basically a duopoly.Facebook I guess if you think Libra will ever take off, but really nothing right now.Amazon if they start taking payments seriously will be a threat. Amazon Pay is not taking payments seriously.",0,0.502,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"would it be paypal (venmo)? If thats true, then it means its a return to cash because people would essentially pay for items using venmo without going through visa or mastercard's network. I'm not convinced thats even a threat.","true, that amazon pay could have an impact, but I think the retail trend is slowly moving away from amazon and back to target and walmart. I know I did all my shopping through walmart and target for the holidays and saved tons of money and had the luxuary of picking the items up at the store.",1,0.513,0.95,NEGATIVE
,"would it be paypal (venmo)? If thats true, then it means its a return to cash because people would essentially pay for items using venmo without going through visa or mastercard's network. I'm not convinced thats even a threat.",Disagree. Walmart and Target are definitely increasing their online presence but they're still miles behind Amazon. Expecting customers to pick up their packages in store/relying on traditional delivery methods isn't good enough. I can order something from Amazon while at work and it's already delivered to my house when I get home. This is not a small undertaking and it will only further solidify Amazon as the gold standard in retail.,2,0.524,0.999,NEGATIVE
,"would it be paypal (venmo)? If thats true, then it means its a return to cash because people would essentially pay for items using venmo without going through visa or mastercard's network. I'm not convinced thats even a threat.","My experiences with amazon have declined and this is their biggest vulnerability. If they don’t deliver on time, the right product, that meets expectations- they’ll lose consumer confidence and this is the key to online shopping. If the customer feels like amazon might not deliver what they promised on time, they will go to the store and get it.About half of my purchases lately have had issues, not good.",3,0.517,1.0,NEGATIVE

,"would it be paypal (venmo)? If thats true, then it means its a return to cash because people would essentially pay for items using venmo without going through visa or mastercard's network. I'm not convinced thats even a threat.","Problem is sqaure is a tech company that is innovative. There is nothing stopping square from working with retailers to cut out v/ma. Some of these companies actually pay more for cc processing fees than profits from their business. So you can see why they always complain. Imagine if square along and said they are developing square pay where the merchant gets 0% processing fees and then the merchant can offer cash back to their customers instead.Now just imagine if target, walmart and major grocery chains all teamed up together to say they arent going to accept v/ma cards anymore. Everyone would bail on v and ma. V and ma biggest advatantage is they are accepted at majority of places.",2,0.537,1.0,NEGATIVE

,"would it be paypal (venmo)? If thats true, then it means its a return to cash because people would essentially pay for items using venmo without going through visa or mastercard's network. I'm not convinced thats even a threat.",Square is the platform which support Visa’s or Mastercard’s or Amex’s payment processing. You could make the argument that Square’s Cash App (their version of Venmo) could take some of the market share but it’s more likely that it’s expanding addressable market of transactions than cannibalizing the transactions which would usually be routed through Visa/MasterCard,1,0.53,0.64,POSITIVE

,"would it be paypal (venmo)? If thats true, then it means its a return to cash because people would essentially pay for items using venmo without going through visa or mastercard's network. I'm not convinced thats even a threat.",Not much. I would say American Express is the closest you will find. Visa and MasterCard are toll roads who make money off of every transaction. AmEx is exposed to credit risk while Visa and MasterCard are not. But since they collect data from both the customer and merchant side they can market more individualized products. AmEx customers also tend to spend more.,0,0.532,0.999,NEGATIVE

If I'm Apple and I can get a tiny piece of every Apple Pay transaction without having to build the rails (which would come at enormous cost) or having to face the regulatory scrutiny that a financial entity like V/MA do, not a bad deal for Apple.
