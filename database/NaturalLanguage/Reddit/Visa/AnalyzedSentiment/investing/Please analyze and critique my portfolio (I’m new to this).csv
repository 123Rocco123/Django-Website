,"For context, I’m 24 and have majority of my money in index funds. However, I do have a small stock portfolio I plan to hold for the long term (25 years +). My investing goal is to invest in the best companies in the world. I would describe these companies as having durable moats, high ROIC, dominant market positions, growing FCF and revenues, high margins, recurring and consistent income, run by strong management with discipline capital allocation and plenty of opportunity to redeploy excess capital and compound over the long term. Please critique / analyze / or feedback for my portfolio. I’m always trying to improve and take this serious as I truly love analyzing and owning great companies.

If your goal is to beat market return as it appears, I would recommend that every few years you do the math for yourself and compare your return against the indexes like VOO, VT, VTI. Most retail investors that pick their own stocks do not, and it is often a game of beating it one year and missing the next. If you enjoy doing analysis and watching your picks, your time doing this isn't worth much consideration. If you don't particularly, or consider it a chore, you would certainly be better off with these indexes for the long run as your time is being spent.Good effort, you've already checked the most important box at 24 which is participating!",0,0.537,NEGATIVE,1.0

Can you really stay updated on the antitrust lawsuits against it? What about their healthcare ventures? Do you know their lead competitors in their pharmacy business or their plans to grow their virtual telehealth division?Of course, maybe you can convince yourself that the level of research and analysis you’ve done for each company is sufficient. But I think that’d be a tad bit naive. The amount of analysis is always going to be infinite, and unless you have your own bulletproof definition of what constitutes a “good company”, I’d argue that you may as well just buy more index funds and save yourself the hours of “research”.Also a more general hot take…how do you know what strong management looks like? Or what a dominant market position looks like? Genuine question, because I am not fully convinced that those are meaningful metrics, although I may be wrong.All of the “best companies” have phenomenal talent in their C-suite that went to Harvard or Wharton. And they all have significant market capture. I just don’t think those “metrics” should play a significant role in your investment decision. They seem hand-wavey to me.",0,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.999
