,,"Opportunity. People for years now have been saying ridiculous things like, ""Apple Pay gonna cause problems for Visa!"" Well, wtf do you think you're using to pay for things via Apple Pay? Visa. Or whatever other card. There's also tokenization: https://usa.visa.com/visa-everywhere/security/secure-digital-payments-through-tokenization.html. That said, mobile payments haven't even taken off in the US as hoped for a number of different reasons.Even look at something like Square Cash. What does that offer you to attach to the account? A debit card. Visa.There's other examples of how Visa and Mastercard have worked their way into digital payments and how the companies have both worked to evolve with payments tech.The one thing that I'm concerned about in regards to V/MA is Amazon, because they have the means and they have the motivation.Visa is not without competition from technology, but there's plenty of evidence that Visa and Mastercard have continued to work on evolving with technology. For some reason there's been a tremendous amount of negative speculation against Visa and Mastercard's future over the years, which acts as if there's no moat to these companies. It's ridiculous.",0,0.531,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,"Threat.Goldman Sachs/Circle/Coinbase recent released a USD token on the Ethereum blockchain managed by an organization known as https://www.centre.io. This new coin is a solution that will enable digital payments in a cash-like instrument that is redeemable for $1 USD/1 USDC. This means that today merchants can implement software code to digitally accept (stable crypto) payments without any banks, credit cards, intermediaries, etc. This new development is going to supercharge the fintech industry, startups can now build applications without needing to interface with a bank, ever.A company like Square can add this new crypto network to their existing payment app, give merchants a hefty discount on processing of transactions through this new network, incentivize consumers to use it (discounts, freebies) and slowly eat away at the Visa/MC networks market share.Internet companies like Amazon or Ebay can use this network to reduce their processing fees across the board, speed payments to their merchants.Now there is nothing preventing VISA or MC from adopting these same solutions and prospering, but we have seen time and again that it is difficult for entrenched legacy businesses to pivot off their success.",0,0.54,0.722,POSITIVE

,,"I can explain it in many ways, but how about this one.You scan something you want to buy in the store, it is added to your virtual cart (on your phone) and when you are ready to walk out of the store you hit a button in app to pay for those items (no lines, no waiting). Your payment is instantly transferred from your account to the merchant (not 3 business days, not next day, not next hour, next second) without ACH, without paying security people to manage your banking servers and databases. If you are using a credit account you still get your rewards.You may realize there isn't much different on the surface, and that is the whole point. The system is made much more secure and efficient using crypto, the end user doesn't see much of a difference.",2,0.523,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"I didn't think you were asking for an explanation of crypto.A blockchain is a decentralized ledger, that tracks ownership of tokens. Token transfer is enabled by proving you own those tokens by submitting a key secured by cryptography to the ledger maintainers. Ledger maintainers will also mine tokens to prove some work was done to maintain the ledger as a way to prevent spam and create scarcity of tokens. Without the mining function, you could essentially just run the ledger as fast as your computer can add numbers, and none of the tokens would be scarce. (like anything else digital)Indeed, the blockchain network could eventually function almost exactly like a debit card/credit card, but the advantage is that we can cut out a lot of the current infrastructure, while enabling new use cases we haven't thought about yet.The blockchain networks themselves do not get hacked, it is the supporting systems that get hacked. Many people creating the software that is integrating with the blockchain network make mistakes in their development and it leads to issues. Also people do not follow best practices with regard to their personal safety which also causes security issues. The bigger, regulated exchanges (Coinbase, Circle, Gemini) haven't had many issues, they typically use protocols that make it very, very safe to secure funds. Those same entities will function like your bank, and enable transfers via the blockchain that are much more efficient than the existing system.",3,0.52,0.971,NEGATIVE

,,"That all depends on the time horizon. Seems like you’re only looking it at only the consumer level. So much of current digital payments rely on existing infrastructure where visa and MasterCard has a strong foothold.You can bang the crypto decentralisation drum all you want, but so far it’s not made any real progress in real life terms because hardly any business would trust their day to day transactions with it.In the foreseeable future, there is a lot of resistance new tech will need to go through to even come close to making a dent in visa and MasterCard pie (regulation, fragmentation, efficiency, cost, etc) It’s unrealistic to expect the world (at least the western world) to jump through all the hoops and risks involved to switch over. Even if something technically revolutionary enough comes along, there’s likely ample time for visa and MasterCard to prepare for it. Not to mention they can also go M&A and buy out all the so called disruptors if need be.",1,0.532,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"IMO credit cards currently have three big advantages over crypto-payments:Speed of transferWidespread acceptanceReversibility/Fraud protection#1 & #2 may change in the future, but as far as I know the gap has not been narrowed meaningfully since the development of Bitcoin 10 years ago, nor in the past 18 months since mainstream attention hit.#3 is the big thing I don't think will ever change. If someone steals your CC info, sure they can run up large charges. However, you can dispute those charges and not have to pay, in fact, the CC companies are on the lookout for those fraudulent charges (in part because it saves them money if they are caught early). Due to the decentralization of cryptocurrencies (which is a central thesis for many adopters), you are screwed once the crypto leaves your possession. Someone gains access to your key/wallet (I am probably butchering lingo), it's gone and it's not coming back.",1,0.514,0.981,NEGATIVE
,,"Speed of transferYou mean speed of Authorization, the transfer of funds still takes days.2) Widespread acceptanceAnyone with a mobile phone will be able to accept crypto, pretty soon you won't require the card. Square has shown that merchants can easily accept cards without requiring the terminal, if some processor could get consumers to use their app to pay then people might consider dropping the card.3) Reversibility/Fraud protectionThis is still a possibility with crypto, just implement a layer 2/3 solution. The base layer is meant to be a cash like instrument where if it is gone, it is gone. But you can easily build a system to provide protections (at some cost).",2,0.518,0.985,NEGATIVE
,,"IMO the problem with widespread acceptance is that until the Treasury accepts tax payments in crypto-currencies, you won't see widespread adoption from merchants or businesses. Same reason they don't accept foreign currencies. Nobody wants to have to deal with currency conversion.There is a network effect for vendors as well, but theoretically that hurdle rate can be achieved where everyone accepts crypto, but you still run into a road block with taxes.For reversibility/fraud. I don't know much of anything about the more nuanced stuff you listed, but until its super easy for the basic user to understand and utilize, it's a non-starter. Fraud protection and unauthorized charges are super easy to understand and navigate with credit cards.",3,0.51,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"Merchants and businesses would be accepting USD, just transferred over the blockchain network vs. the traditional banking network so there is not a concern regarding tax payments.Think of layer 1 as a pure cash solution (but digitally). A layer 2/3 solution (digital banking) basically adds consumer services that get paid by someone (interest on debts, fees through merchants, some mechanism similar to what is used now)",4,0.527,0.948,NEGATIVE
,,"I am using crypto-currencies and ""cash over blockchain network"" as two distinct things. Perhaps that is not linguistically correct, but when I say ""crypto-currency"" I mean BTC, LTC, ETH, etc. Those still need to be converted into USD just as paying with EUR or GBP. That's where the tax issue resides. As long as those currencies have a volatile exchange rate with USD, it's unwise for anyone, individual or merchant, to accept payment when they will have to pay taxes on such an exchange later on.",5,0.525,0.884,NEGATIVE
,,"I agree with that statement, and I still think most people and businesses will choose to transact in USD on the blockchain. The concerns about managing extra taxes are unfounded.",6,0.509,0.659,NEGATIVE
,,It is already happening. Apple and Amazon don't want a chunk of their profits going to other companies and they don't want to do that business themselves.That is why they have the interledger protocol.

,,"Sure, payments are way more efficient through a blockchain than through ACH.Lets go through a thought experiment. For me to send $0.01 or $1,000,000,000 through the banks it requires a person to run the computers (dba, website) and a person to ensure regulation and compliance at each institution. At the bare minimum there is at least 2 people at the bank required to make my transaction, in reality there is probably 3 levels of management and additional people surrounding these employees, but because of scale we will omit them. So 2 people making an average of $50,000 per year is $100,00 at each bank, and then we'll throw in 2 people at ACH to do the same. So to do a simple digital transaction we require $300,000 a year.To send $0.000000001 or $1,000,000,000 through a blockchain requires about $0.011, this network is peer to peer.",4,0.531,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"Did you simply decide not amortize the overhead across the entire volume of ACH transactions? And it’s not like “decentralized” is a synonym for “maintenance-free.” In fact, decentralization replicates overhead.
