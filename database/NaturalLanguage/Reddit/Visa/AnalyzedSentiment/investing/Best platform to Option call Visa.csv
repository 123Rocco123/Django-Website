,"I was going to run an Option call trade on Visa that would expire in a month. I usually use Charles Schwab, but I checked the premium for Robinhood and Fidelity (same strike price and experation date) and they are drastically lower. Does anyone know the lowest costing option trading platform? Robinhood $300 with an experation date of 3/06/2020 Fidelity $422 with an experation date of 3/06/2020 Charles Schwab $565 with the same experation date.",I’m no expert but those premiums dont mean you’ll get filled at that price. There seems to be a big gap between the bid and ask on options. That price is pretty meaningless and works the same every broker (except ppl complain about robinhood fills).,0,0.511,1.0,NEGATIVE

The options trade on the same exchange, so as long as you are looking at the same point in time, they should be identical.But the same point in time may be what is causing the difference. One platform might have 5 minute delayed quotes while the other has real-time. Or you might have compared prices during market hours on one and after market hours on the other.Another issue with pricing is the spread. I've heard the RH uses the mid-point. The other platforms may use the market (ask for buying, bid for selling) or the last trade. This is why its generally safer to state the full spread when comparing.What strike price are you looking at? I'll compare what I have and see if there are differences on Monday.",0,0.527,1.0,NEGATIVE
