,"Completely new investor here. I'm currently maxing out my retirement each year and have an emergency fund. So I'm now playing with stocks for money before retirement. If my goal is to gain a decent return over the medium-long term (~4-8 years), is it a good idea to invest in the following stocks and hold? What would you do differently in my shoes? Currently: Netflix, Apple, Visa, Alibaba",r/investing is not a crystal ball. You would probably incite a more thoughtful discussion if you explained why you invested in these companies.,0,0.52,0.744,NEGATIVE

Currently: Netflix, Apple, Visa, Alibaba","It might be wise to diversify more - netflix, apple and alibaba are all internet companies (with internet company price tags), which makes them expensive.More to the point, your time horizon of 4-8 years is good, but a significant downturn or recession could still wipe out any short term gains and ultimately leave you with a loss 4-8 years down the road.My advice would be to do more fundamental analysis of the companies you are thinking of investing in. That will if nothing else highlight the 5 -6x multiplier on net value per share compared to the market price per share which is characteristic of the tech sector.Another consideration: the most popular companies (the apples and microsofts) of the world are watched closely by some of the best traders around (think hedgefunds, investment banks) and so smaller companies can often provide ""easier"" opportunities for home traders.",0,0.552,0.997,NEGATIVE

Currently: Netflix, Apple, Visa, Alibaba","Thank you. I don't work in the corporate world and tech companies are what I'm familiar with/interested in. I'll look into diversifying more!If I was interested in smaller companies as well, where would be a good place to start with researching them? Do you have specific companies in mind that you'd recommend? Also, I imagine smaller companies = higher risk, generally, correct?",1,0.554,0.554,NEGATIVE

Currently: Netflix, Apple, Visa, Alibaba","First off I would never recommend you make a trade based on someone else's recommendation. If it goes well you won't know when to sell, and if it goes badly that's usually followed by panic, as you have no idea why the stock is falling, and usually you'll close out at the worst possible time. The world is also to full of people wanting ""tips"" because that's easy, but consistently making money is the financial markets is not easy, it's often time consuming and hard.It's often good to invest in what you know, but buying stock in the same sector as your job (guessing here), then that makes a really bad hedge. You generally want your investments to be as independent of your main income (salary) as possible.In terms of where to start looking, my experience is in the UK markets and so the FTSE250/FTSE350 would be the place to look for smaller companies. It's ranked by market capitalization.As to smaller companies being more risky, that's not a great generalization. It depends on how you look at risk, which is an area that you should really look into. One way to look at risk is by volatility, and generally you will see somewhat more volatility in the ftse250 compared to the ftse100 - but as your not investing in the index your only concerned with the volatility of the stocks in your portfolio - that can give you a general idea of the amount of risk you hold for your portfolio. E.g. Apple volatility is generally ~0-1% a day, which means your risk is ~0-1% per day.I've written a free book about investing in shares for beginners, I think you would find it useful so I'll PM you the link!",2,0.531,1.0,NEGATIVE
