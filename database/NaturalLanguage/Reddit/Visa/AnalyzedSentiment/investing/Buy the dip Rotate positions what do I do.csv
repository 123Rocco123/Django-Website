Very upset that Sarah Friar left to become CEO of Nextdoor. Dorsey was ridiculous not to make her CEO and be Chairman. Her leaving (and the announcement was totally abrupt) really throws things into question a little. This is a person that has basically acted as the CEO and the face of the company; she's been the one talking up the company and for her to just suddenly up and leave for a smaller social media site is not a positive sign. And you know what? I may be wrong and it may just go back up near the highs again before long. However, when someone that important to a company leaves in that manner I have to be cautious because someone talking up a company like that just deciding to go head some social media site makes me think that the Square opportunity was perhaps no longer as compelling, at least in comparison. She's on the board of Walmart; if this was her leaving for a role at something giant like Walmart then I'd be maybe a little more understanding.""Also what do you guys think about Macy's?"" Macy's has turned things around, but I would not buy something because of the dividend. Take the dividend away, do you like the business? If not, then no. People could have also pointed to Bed Bath and Beyond having a decent dividend for a while now. Meanwhile, the stock is currently below 2008 lows. What's the dividend done for those shareholders? That was what like $80 a few years ago?ROKU and ADBE are appealing IMO as long-term holdings. I really don't want to own FB and GOOGL has not lived up to expectations in a while; the idea that they didn't tell about the breach recently because they were worried about reputation and regulatory scrutiny. I think have concerns - moreso with Facebook than Google - that these companies are not appreciating the mood in regards to privacy and the possibility that regulation could appear. Facebook is also just totally tone deaf putting out that smart home camera. AMZN still like very much as a long-term holding.V and MA are good. I'd rather ABT in terms of boring healthcare plays than JNJ.Nobody can predict the bottom. However, when you look at late January and stocks were as overbought as they have been in like 2 decades, it was a time to be cautious. When stocks become as oversold as they were in February and were yesterday, there is at least a reasonably solid chance that you're close to at least a short-term bottom. There may be a retest at some point. I think you have to have a long-term view and allocate in a way that fits your risk tolerance.",0,0.538,1.0,NEGATIVE

The main one has been the Bruce Berkowitz thesis on Sears, which he owned since 2005 and that is now looking like a 0. Starboard originally talked about Macy's spinning its real estate off somewhere around $60, then eventually sold around $30.Not a retailer (a real estate company with a good deal of retail), but people have also talked up the value of Howard Hughes (HHC), which continues to languish near multi-year lows. Ackman pressured Target to spin off a REIT about a decade ago. I do have confidence that Brookfield can successfully redevelop these assets (as it is also doing for a number of GGP malls after it bought that recently), but I tend to be skeptical of buying retailers because of the real estate. People can talk up the value of real estate that a retailer owns, but I think a lot of times value is just destroyed broadly at the company in the meantime (Sears) or it just takes ages/doesn't happen quite as hoped (Macy's.) I will say that Macy's has done a nice job at least righting the ship.Starboard Macy's presentation for anyone interested (pdf file): https://www.starboardvalue.com/publications/Starboard_Value_LP_Presentation_M_01.11.16.pdf""And I was looking at T and BX as they are near they cyclical bottoms, big dividends, T is rolling out 5g think they have some upside""In terms of T and 5g, I'd rather say AMT/SBAC/CCI as the T's and VZ's of the world are going to have to spend with the upgrade cycle.

Large brick & mortar stores, especially ""anchor"" stores, have been on the decline across the board; Sears, JCPenney, Macy's, Toys R Us, Von Maur, Yonkers, the list goes on.The sales are moving to online, department stores, and small discount stores; pretty much in that order. With that trend there is no value in the real estate from large anchor stores because there are no stores/businesses expanding that need such a large physical retail presence and could carry the rents demanded. I honestly don't know how people can believe that. Jack Dorsey has been beating that drum for Sears, but I have a hard time thinking he is dumb enough to believe it himself. All you need to do is go to any city in the midwest and see these locations sitting empty for years and even in some cases being torn down and turned into parking lots.",3,0.521,1.0,NEGATIVE

They have about 22M active accounts, which is around the same # that Comcast has in terms of cable (https://www.statista.com/statistics/497279/comcast-number-video-subscribers-usa/). The advertising business is strong and the company has a terrific, detailed vision of the ad business and where they want to go with it.Roku isn't something that I had on my radar either, but upon doing more research into the company and going through conference calls and presentations, I actually was pretty impressed with management and there was definitely more to the story than I thought/then there appeared to be at first glance.It's not a large position, but it's something that I can see gradually increasing over time if things continue to progress. I think it's a very good a play broadly on the future of television viewing as more and more people cut the cord - whether it be a smart TV with a Roku TV o/s or players. Also, as more and more advertising goes to connected TV (I mean, ad tech co Trade Desk Q1 - ""-- Connected TV grew over 2,000% from Q12017 to Q12018."" In Q2 that business doubled from Q1), Roku's advertising platform continues to benefit.Roku has also seen some benefits from being something of a neutral platform while Google and Amazon have fought (there is no official Youtube app on FireTV, for example.) The company is certainly not without risks/concerns (and not a wide moat), but I'm certainly positive on it and like management quite a bit.Thank you so much for your comments about my posts!

Long term, TVs are getting more and more complex and the longer there isnt a competitor the longer roku gets entrenched as THE TV OS developer. Think of it like a PC. Long time a go the hardware manufacturers took care of the software as well, but eventually the software and the hardware separated into 2 separate products.

That's just people being complete morons but the system supported them. Just look at the credit ratings. It was more than a bubble and it was definitely more than a local issue.

The local population couldn't support those rents and they would get crazy offers like ""Can I pay you back once I get a job?"" Or how about Stockton, CA? That real estate market was insane.

,"Got pretty hammered on a few positions - looking at you Square. I've got about 20% sitting in cash on the sidelines. This fall has also pushed a number of my positions that were up a lot into flat or even net losses, and I've been wanting to rotate some out of tech as I'm way over weight there. Do I sell some of those tech positions now that they are at a loss and move them to some of the more stable positions I was hoping to get into? Do I keep the cash sitting - obviously no one can predict the bottom etc etc etc, so do I just bite and enter on this dip with half of the cash on the sidelines? -DIS -TRBCX -JNJ -V -MSFT (yeah tech but, solid co) DO i add more to the tech stocks I had, I mean a lot fo the gains were wiped out: ADBE, ROKU, AMZN, GOOG, FB (FANG looking attractive), and what do i do with SQuare [ave in 76 - buy more?]? -suggestions?
