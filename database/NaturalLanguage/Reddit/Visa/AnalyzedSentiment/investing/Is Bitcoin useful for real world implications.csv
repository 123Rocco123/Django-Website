,"Bitcoin can process a maximum of approximately 576,000 transactions in 24 hours. (That’s the theoretical limit — the actual limit is closer to 350k). By contrast, even a small country like New Zealand (population < 5mn) carries out some 4.4mn financial transactions a day. The EU carries out some 274 million electronic transactions a daily, while the US carries out some 600mn (that may include stock and bond settlements too, I’m not sure). In short, Bitcoin couldn’t manage as the currency for a decent-sized city. Not to mention that Bitcoin mining already uses as much electricity as the country of Iraq and almost as much as Singapore. Each single Bitcoin transaction uses as much electricity as 13 American homes use in a day. It uses as much energy as 260,000 Visa transactions. An incredible waste of resources. (see Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index - Digiconomist ) In fact, Bitcoin mining now uses more electricity than the output of all the solar panels installed in the world. It’s single-handedly offsetting much of the progress that’s been made in de-carbonizing the global economy. It’s an ecological disaster. Bitcoin does nothing that currently existing systems don’t do much, much more efficiently and cheaply. Oh, and did I mention how frequently the exchanges are hacked and all the Bitcoins stolen? And that its only so-called benefit, anonymity, is actually hackable too? And why do people think that enabling tax evasion and paying for illegal acts is a benefit anyway? Via Marshall Gittler on Twitter. Thoughts?","Bitcoin has been shown to be really useful to law enforcement in tracking cartel members and other illicit operations including human trafficking.When they were forced to use cash, criminals could operate more anonymously. Now there are tools, e.g. Chainalysis, which specialize in identifying who owns what wallets and it is actually easier to track and prosecute people.So there is at least one benefit of Bitcoin.",0,0.516,0.881,POSITIVE

For a start it would impossible for bitcoin to be used to any great degree for transactions anyway unless each bitcoin was worth a lot more than it started out at, as the market cap of all bitcoin is a cap on how much can be transferred at once.Bitcoin needs a certain amount of transactions to survive, but much more than that it needs people holding it and for the value per bitcoin to be high enough.",1,0.514,1.0,NEGATIVE

Nostr default native currency is bitcoin.Money used to perform both as medium of exchange and store of value, bitcoin is fulfilling both but very volatile.People in this sub love hating it, but a majority of them don't really have a strong enough economic background, most have finance background which is built around credit based market.

Via Marshall Gittler on Twitter. Thoughts?","Bitcoin's energy usage is a big deal, but I think there are some nuanced points that are important to understand.You cannot claim a certain energy usage per transaction. That isn't how the network works. It processes transactions in blocks, and you can estimate average energy to create 1 block. But that block can contain a varying number of transactions, and due to some interesting incentives, sometimes even zero transactions. Point is, to claim a certain energy use per transaction ignores an important way the blockchain functions. Future improvements to the protocol could allow more transactions per block via forks or 2nd layer solutions.The energy used can come from any source, renewable or non-renewable. There are many different studies that make different claims about the percentage of Bitcoin's energy consumption that come from renewables, and it varies widely, so I won't claim a certain number here. Some argue Bitcoin can in a way subsidize the creation of many sources of renewable energy that create excess energy during non-peak times (hydro and solar), since that excess energy that would otherwise be wasted can be put to work and produce Bitcoin.To some extent the ""wastefulness"" of something's energy usage is subjective. If you personally see no value in something, or have a bias against it, then its energy usage will certainly be wasteful, regardless of the amount used. Clothes dryers in the US alone use a similar amount of energy as Bitcoin mining (around 100 TWh per year). Whether one is more useful than another is a subjective analysis.",0,0.521,0.999,NEGATIVE

There's anywhere from 5-6 participants assuming risk and collecting a small percentage of any transaction that appears to be instant. The truth is the banks dont reconcile balances until the next day.When people talk about layer 2 solutions for bitcoin they are talking about things like lightning network and fee for service networks that will facilitate and scale the number of transactions that bitcoin can handle per second. Some upgrades reduce the transaction size, others aggregate 10s or 100s of transactions into one hash, some add privacy features.
