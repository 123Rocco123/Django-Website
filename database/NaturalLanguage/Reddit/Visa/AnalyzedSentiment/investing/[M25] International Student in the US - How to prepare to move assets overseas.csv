,"Hi, I am a student set to graduate by December of this year. My graduate student stipend is 33K a year (2.5K a month post-tax and health insurance). I am on an F-1 visa, my wife is on an F-2 visa. My wife nor I are from the US, we might stay for another 3 years with my OPT authorization. However, we are looking for a more stable environment ASAP (not having to worry about visas). I am from South America and my wife is Eastern European. I am confortable with leaving the Roth IRA investments in the US until we are of retirement age. However, I am not sure if Robinhood is the most friendly platform for people who do not longer reside in the US, what other alternatives are there? We have the most job opportunities available in places like Germany, Canada, and the UK. I have a job offer after graduation in the US, salary will be 100K in a mid-high cost of living area, no promises of H1B sponsorship. I do not wish to delay our life and family goals due to the uncertainty of visa legislations. Here is a little more detail about our financial situation. We have the following assets and liabilities: Robinhood Taxed account [~26.5K]: -2K in VTI -5K in VOO -9K in VGT -2K in VUG -2K QQQM -4K SMH -2K in Single Stocks (META, BABA, TCEHY) -500 Crypto Robinhood ROTH IRA [14.2K] - 14.2K VOO HYSA Discover: -11K Car: Lexus CT200H 2011 ~182K miles. Bought in cash for 7K (after tax and registration). Debt: About 700 (0% APY credit card, originally 5K from our wedding last October) dollars, will be paid off this month. Any suggestions are welcomed.","I'm in very much the same situation. Currently on OPT but not for much longer.I recently moved all my assets over to Charles Schwab. They are one of the few brokerages who will not shut down your account once you leave the US. According to the rep I spoke to on the phone you will also be able to keep buying ETFs (no mutual funds tho, so just find the ETF equivalents of the funds you have).If you want to invest using foreign currency (Euro?) you might look into Interactive Brokers, too.Lastly, I opened a Wise account just to easily convert USD into other currencies or vice versa.",0,0.529,1.0,NEGATIVE

Most investors have nothing good to say about Hood and are surprised it is still around. Suggest you quickly transfer to other reputable big investment firm.",0,0.527,0.987,NEGATIVE
