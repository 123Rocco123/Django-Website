,"So I read this book buffetology and it has opened up my mind up to the powers of compound interest and I think that I could get ahead of everyone by thinking long term. My plan is to go do summer sales next year and try to at least 30k. I’m then going to invest 30 percent of whatever I get into ETF’s or an index fund and the other 70 percent into dividend growth stocks. Stocks ive been looking at are hershey, accenture, agilent technologies, air products and chemicals, blackrock, canadian national railway, broadridge financial solutions, danaher, linde, MSCI inc, S&P global inc, thermo fisher, united health, visa and zoetis. I’m planning on revaluating my stock picks every 5-10 years and i’m going to try and grow the money from summer sales for 40 years to be my retirement. Is this a smart plan or a foolish one? Is there any companies that you would suggest. My goal is to grow the money between 10-15 percent each year, it would be preferable to have an average compounding rate of 14 percent but 12 percent would be sufficient for over the 40 years.","You are at a young enough age where you can experiment a bit with investing, imo. 40 years is a very long time to have a ""plan"" if you are actively picking stocks & just starting out. It's likely your investing style will change every year as you get more experience and real world exposure to volatility. Having said that, if your time frame is 40 years and you are just looking for retirement $ (not a get rich quick scheme) you'd probably be best off just investing in a total market fund and focusing on increasing your income instead of taking on added risk trying to squeeze out 15% a year, which is very unlikely.",0,0.563,0.994,NEGATIVE

It’s not like I get to keep any of the money but it has given me experience in the market. What i’ve found with me is that i went into the market with a plan and i ended up veering away from it in search of more riskier high growth stocks in chase of a higher return on investment. I ended up losing money. This has given me the realization that placing short term bets in the stock market is most certainly dependent on luck. The companies that i’ve listed above I haven’t looked into them yet to give them catigorical tests on their business economics that were given by my investing guide book(buffetology). That being said, they all have 2 things in common, 16+/20 eps growth, with the majority of those years being double digit growth and a high paying dividend. This doesn’t mean that there is a moat but it’s highly indicative of one, however i’d have to look into them further before making the investment decision. All this being said i’ve pretty much decided that i’m going to invest in companies with strong track records that have economic moats or consumer monopolies and that pay high dividends and im going to hold them for a long time. If I were to make my first purchase I would definetly buy hershey because of the sell off but i don’t have any money yet.

Being able to pick stocks is at least 4th in importance. Increasing your income is most important, reducing expenses is second, then asset allocation. Everything else has a lower impact. Increase your income, manage your lifestyle creep, automate the saving, and put primarily in low cost index funds will lead to better results than trying to pick stocks.It felt like cheating or outside the game of picking stocks, to just increase saving. But compound interest is an undeniable freight train when you have a high savings rate and a growing income. If you are spending 5-10 hours per week researching how to beat the market, redirect those efforts to figuring out how to master your professional craft and use that knowledge to increase your income.",0,0.544,1.0,NEGATIVE

It matches the same market as VOO (the vanguard S&P ETF). But FXAIX is a mutual fund, not an ETF. ETFs can be traded any part of the day, but mutual funds are exchanged at end of day for end of day price. This limits their flexibility. However, FXAIX has a cost basis half as expensive as VOO (FXAIX costs 0.015% per year, VOO costs 0.030% per year). Its so so small, because theyre both low cost funds, but I dont need to move in and out of the market with ETF flexibility, so I go with FXAIX for long term lower costs with completely equivalent performance in terms of their fund matching of the S&P.

I used all of it to start a business that eventually failed.I had to start investing again after I went bankrupt. I started investing slowly and as I made mistakes I made corrections to my process. I had invested in over 20 stocks and found that hard to manage, I whittled that down to 10, and now I have 4 stocks that I invest in.

Yes, buy some here and there but don't go too crazy. There have been so many times in the past where I could have bought more stocks during major downturns in the market, but I couldn't since I was leveraged to the hilt. Always have cash on hand in your portfolio so when a major dip in the market occurs you can buy more of the stock you are already investing in.Unless you are an accredited investor, be aware of the day-trading limits. Buying and selling stocks right away can get you in hot water with the feds and possibly your broker.If you need to leverage your portfolio, try to keep the amount you borrow against your portfolio to less than 10%. When you borrow you run the risk of having the broker call your margin when the stocks dive.

My recommendation is pay for college first and foremost, investing in yourself, especially college depending on degree, has a very high ROI.In the case that is covered by parents/grants/scholarship, then I would recommend just buying a broad market fund (ETF). I mean I literally do stock picking in a small brokerage account, but that is not retirement money for me, I recommend if you get 30k, you will not be able to pick a company that will outperform the market for 40+years, just highly unlikely, and unless it is in an Roth IRA where you can buy/sell tax free, just buy a broad market ETF.If it is a real job, put 6k into a Roth IRA, I doubt you can do a 401k at a summer job, you might be able to make it self-directed though afterwards.
