,"Overall /investing and /stocks are bullish on Visa, and the stock has done extremely well in this bull market. It seems like there's tremendous growth in the payment processing realm, due to impending global transition from cash to electronic transfers. However, what I *don't* get, is how Visa, a for-fee payment processor, is addressing the rise of P2P payments like WeChat Pay (which I'm certainly no expert in, and have never used). With transaction fees, what does Visa do to address high-growth developing markets? What are your thoughts on Visa's future competitiveness in this space? Visa has obvious advantages, but I'd like /investing's thoughts and analysis. Greatly appreciated!","Visa/MC/Amex all offer secure electronic transactions and purchase/fraud protection. They are the gold standard backbone of payment processing and will probably have a lock for decades. With the massive growth of ecommerce, processors are poised to grow with it.Any small processor that attempts to disrupt the big boys will probably just get bought imho.",0,0.518,0.999,POSITIVE
