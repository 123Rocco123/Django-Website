,"Good day all. I am hoping that some of you out there with knowledge and experience in trading and the stock market in general can share your opinion on an idea that I have. So I have $40000 that I would like to use to generate me some extra income. The plan is spread the $40000 around 8 stocks, $5000 on eack stock, all on blue chip stocks. Apple, Microsoft, Visa, Walmart, Verizon, McDonalds etc. I will buy the stocks during a dip with he goal, or aim to sell when the stocks gain 2-3%. Is it an achievable and conservative goal to aim for 2-3% gains over a period of 2 weeks? Which will generate an income of $800-1200 every 2 weeks. Can this realistically be done or is it easier said than done? Thanks in advance","2-3% over 2 weeks = 52-78% over 1 year.Do you really think you could do this continuously? Of course it's easier said than done, or else everyone would be doing it. You might get it once or twice, but then when you rebuy you could see a 15% drop.",0,0.577,1.0,NEGATIVE

Every stock is different so don't just fix that amount at 5000/ stock. Also, get an exit plan. Last, swing traders do not look for just 2-3%. you want to play big swings. Big swings come when major events happen and a lot of people are wrong. Also, expect that your hit ratio will probably not be high. So minimize losses by having a stop loss.",0,0.549,1.0,NEGATIVE
