,"Not sure if this is helpful at all or if anyone cares, but since has been all the rage for the past ~14 months and has recently been included in the S&P 500, I checked to see what % of it was held by institutional investors, and how that compares with the other 49 of the largest companies by market cap in the world. Some findings: 39.77% of Tesla is held by institutional investors. This places it #43 out of 50, and #42 out of 44 out of American companies. The only American companies on the top 50 with a lower percentage of itself owned by institutional investors are Wal-Mart and Berkshire Hathaway Class A shares. The overall average is 61.57%. For the United States, it's slightly higher at 67.36%, and for international companies, of which there are only 7, the average is much lower at 19.16%. The lowest is Toyota, with only 1.11% owned by institutional investors. The highest is Visa, with 92.76%.

Already Japan's own pension funds should bring that up much more. Some issue with to data/definition for the international stocks?,0,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE

In general, it seemed like the international companies were less owned by institutional investors, which might mean TD Ameritrade is counting only American institutional investors, since that could explain the lower numbers. Unfortunately, they don't seem to provide that much context.In any event, I screenshotted my brokerage interface so you can see where I got the number from.https://imgur.com/a/WWWgvCk",1,0.514,0.999,NEGATIVE
