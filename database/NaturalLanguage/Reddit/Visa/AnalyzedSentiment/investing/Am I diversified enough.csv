,"So I use m1 finance, mostly due to the fractional shares as I'm a pretty low volume investor. I want to slowly funnel money into my account and let it grow over time. My question is about diversification, I tried to go with a 75/25 split for etfs and stocks just to minimize risk. The 25 of straight stocks I own are Amd 5%, Visa 5%, GOOG 4%, Amazon 4%, Nvidia 4% and Microsoft 3%. These are all companies I trust and think have a good future but I understand it's quite tech heavy. For extra info the rest of my portfolio is 30% VOO, 20% in a pie labeled etfs which is split between VB, VWO, VIG, BNDX, Vgt and VO, 10% in BND, 5% in Vnq and VTV and then the last 5% in a custom version of the CIBR and SKYY etfs. Pretty wordy post but I figured I'd throw it all out here for you guys to tear into me if you want. Please give me your thoughts, feelings and suggestions.","The individual picks seem like solid choices, and I assume you did your due diligence when selecting them so being tech heavy is irrelevant if you believe in the companies. VOO is another solid choice (I like VTI more, but that's just me). You do seem to have split the ETFs heavily and i'd say that you might be too diversified at this point, but again, that may just be a personal preference.I like to pick <10 individual companies I like for the long term (industry is unimportant), and split 10-20% of my money between, then the remaining 80% goes towards VOO/VTI, maybe a little international market to lower my risk.Diversification shouldn't be about the number of ETFs you hold since if you just held a total market ETF on it's own you'd already be plenty diversified.",0,0.519,1.0,NEGATIVE

And then would you just recommend putting the lost % into voo or open a position with vti? Thank you for your useful advice,1,0.506,0.997,NEGATIVE

Please give me your thoughts, feelings and suggestions.","I'm no expert, but if I were in your position I would keep the individual picks you have and raise the % of MSFT, then drop the multiple ETFs and go straight with VTI or VOO for the rest of your portfolio.If you are interested in security, cloud, or any of the other areas the ETFs focus on, then I would recommend investing directly in the companies. Any of the tech stuff I would bet big on MSFT anyway. Most expect continued growth from them. AMD are making some really interesting moves recently too, though I wonder if their growth is sustainable.",2,0.545,1.0,NEGATIVE

I would personally sell AMD and Nvidia (I don't think they have much potential, Nvidia's growth has been mostly fuelled by AI and crypto and I think crypto mania will eventually go away and there will be another AI winter) and move that money into some boring old companies like MCD, PG, JNJ, VZ or something similar. Just my personal opinion. I'd keep GOOG, MSFT, Amazon and Visa as I think those are very solid, perhaps add AAPL to the mix, you are missing that one. Maybe add some dividend stocks to get some income going that you can keep reinvesting.",0,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE
