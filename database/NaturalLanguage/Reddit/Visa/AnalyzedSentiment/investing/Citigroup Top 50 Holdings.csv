We've had this discussion before and OP said ""because they think they're good companies"".In the post GFC regulatory environment banks are effectively prohibited from owning equities as part of their portfolio. They hold equities on behalf of clients, and they hold inventory for trading businesses and what not, which basically means at the end of the day a 13F filing for any major bank is going to be pretty similar to a random collection of large caps.Basically - you should take absolutely nothing away from this. It's not indicative of a quality investment, it's not indicative of what ""smart money"" is doing, and it's not even representative of any sort of strategy - it should be treated as a random sampling of 50 large cap names with no rhyme or reason - that someone downloaded to excel and made a pie chart out of.",0,0.529,1.0,NEGATIVE

The SEC itself has acknowledged that 13F filings are not necessarily reliable because no one at the SEC analyzes the content for accuracy and completeness. After all, the infamous the fraudster Bernard Madoff dutifully filed 13F forms every quarter.Another major issue with 13F reports is that they are filed up to 45 days after the end of a quarter. And most managers submit their 13Fs as late as possible because they do not want to tip off rivals to what they are doing. By the time other investors get their hands on those 13Fs, they are looking at stock purchases that may have been made more than four months prior to the filing. If the smart money is already fully invested in a stock, smaller investors are likely to be late to the party by the time they learn about it.",0,0.527,1.0,NEGATIVE
