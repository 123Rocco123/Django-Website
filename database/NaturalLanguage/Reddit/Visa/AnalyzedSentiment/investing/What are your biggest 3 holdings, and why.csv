,"Mine are: Visa, Baba and Amazon","V, UNH, MSFTGreat companies with lots of money, and lots of ways to make money. Steady and solid staples in many people's lives.Also, at least somewhat diverse. MSFT being full tech, but also selling retail tech items like crazy. V being finance but relying on tech as well. And UNH dabbling in many sectors all with a healthcare inflection. These are my core 3 that everything builds around.",0,0.527,0.995,POSITIVE
,"Mine are: Visa, Baba and Amazon","I personally chose Microsoft because I feel they have more ways to make money than Apple.

,"Mine are: Visa, Baba and Amazon","Agree with the analysis. I do think Apple depends a lot on its iPhone revenue (obviously).

,"Mine are: Visa, Baba and Amazon","Oh I have no doubt that AAPL is extremely profitable, and will be for a long time. MSFT just has the it factor for me. From PC's to software to gaming to everything that goes with it, they can weather storms and come out on top on the other side.I had a good position in AAPL but locked gains when the market started getting funky. Potentially I'm gonna be getting back in.Also yeah, ADBE is on my radar. They don't really have any direct competition, and their software is everywhere and constant. It will only get moreso as we grow evermore dependent on tech.",4,0.541,0.999,POSITIVE
,"Mine are: Visa, Baba and Amazon","I'm always bullish and have positions with AAPL, but I think they have more to prove with services revenue in the coming years. Also not particularly fond that they're trying to get into video streaming as it's going to be extremely competitive soon, but we'll see.Been meaning to get into either MSFT/Amazon soon purely for cloud computing exposure, but not sure when.
