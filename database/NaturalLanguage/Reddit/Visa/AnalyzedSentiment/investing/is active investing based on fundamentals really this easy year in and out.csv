,"I really fail to see why a larger majority of people don't do this with their savings. I started passive investing in 2019 which gave me like a 15% return.

The euphoria can be blinding but where I stand to reason is that so at what point does tech / the general market no longer give us that innovation and growth that the last 10 years has? Say it goes sideways, no big deal. Say that it really goes down but you would have been up enough that its unlikely to come back to the breakeven point or you can utilize other techniques for the drop. The biggest concept I can see in play is diminishing returns in innovation but tech by its nature seems to go against this. The next move is to invest in emerging industries which are naturally going to boom one day like AI / Electric Vehicles. Maybe the valuations are too high and things are in a bubble but one can hope to catch on to this wave. All I'm trying to say that where is the big downside to following this type of logic?",1,0.532,0.999,NEGATIVE

For every Amazon or Tesla, there were startups or midsize companies or even large companies that investors believed in that failed.I do agree with you though that investing in the market for a long time is a wise decision and also that the tech sector growth will likely outpace other sectors.
