,"(Bloomberg) -- Exxon Mobil Corp. is poised to drop out of the S&P 500 Index’s 10 biggest companies for the first time since the index’s inception some 90 years ago, the consummation of a long-term trend of tech titans replacing industrial giants in the top ranks of U.S. stock market. Visa Inc. replaced Exxon as the 10th biggest member of the index by weighting on Aug. 1 and two weeks later Procter & Gamble Co. also overtook the oil giant, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. S&P Dow Jones Indices will likely confirm the move when it publishes its month-end weightings Saturday. “The oil sector has gone from being the leader of the world economy to a laggard,” said Tom Sanzillo, director of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, who traces Exxon’s presence in the S&P top 10 back to the 1920s. The growth of technology giants like Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. over the past decade coincided with the shale revolution that created an abundance of oil globally, weighing on energy companies. Exxon, once the gold standard in Big Oil, also has made some missteps: betting on Russia just before the country was slapped with sanctions and plowing money into U.S. natural gas in 2010 as prices collapsed. With many investors betting on a post-hydrocarbon world, energy faces a battle to stay relevant to generalist investors. The sector makes up just 4.4% of the S&P 500 Index compared with 11.7% a decade ago. https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/exxon-poised-to-drop-from-s-p-500-s-top-10-for-first-time-ever-1.1309462",Give it to ya,0,0.502,0.517,POSITIVE

Most companies including mine have already invested in renewables for few years now and involved in several renewable projects like offshore wind platforms as well as the core oil business. It has actually been quite a simple transfer. Renewables design and engineering is far far less complex and challenging compared to oil platforms and refineries or nuclear power plants, except for a few very niche areas like specific component designs like turbines. But this is just easily bought and only a small piece of the puzzle. The big bulk of work employing the most people still requires similar structural, piping, instrumentation, electrical equipment and good project engineering and management as oil platforms, of which renewable tech being of much smaller scale and much much less risk is far simpler. There are of course a few exceptions. To be honest the actual engineering of things like offshore wind platforms is actually quite boring. It's like taking a big step down in terms of intellectual challenge, which is why I've also been dabbling into IT and automating a lot of our systems and processes also.There also really isn't much competition in this sector. The smaller companies that have been focused solely on this can't compete when the actual production work will come in and will merge and be bought over. It's what's happening in the tech industry too with the big guns like amazon, Facebook buying many of the smaller ones. It's what will happen with Big Oil too once the economics is in their favour. Also unlike tech, energy is government controlled for the most part and not determined by public demand and profits. They have very solid government backing. I'm not advocating this, just stating what's what.Also, this is just upstream oil. Exxon and others have a massive downstream sector. Refineries that produce materials for everything from roads, chemicals, plastics to non stick cookware and lubricants.
