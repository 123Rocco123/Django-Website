,"Debating between dividend or growth investing. I currently hold NFLX, FB, MSFT, FIVE, and FBGRX. I'm debating between going more growth with stocks like TSLA and cloud stocks like OKTA, TWLO, NOW, AYX, TEAM etc. Or proven dividend companies that have slow or non existant growth like home depot, Coca Cola, Visa, Estee Lauder, Boeing, etc. A lot of the growth companies have fundamentals that make no sense and are way overvalued. However, some of the blue chip stocks barely outperform the S & P 500, and although the dividends are comforting when you get them. It would take a 1,000,000 account before you achieved a sizeable amount in dividends, and the growth you would get from growth companies could be 3 to 10X as much as the amount of dividends you receive.","If you have to ask this question, you should probably be putting your money in VTI or SPY, not individual equities.If you insist on buying individual equities, you should research growth vs dividend stocks on google and YouTube rather than asking for answers on reddit. You’ll probably find that there isn’t a black and white answer. Most sources will say growth is preferred for people your age. Others will argue that dividends are better long term. Both could be right. It would depend on your particular basket of stocks, your abilities to do DD on these stocks, overall market conditions, and so much more. Really though, your best bet is to diversify and buy SPY and VTI until you have a solid nest egg. In the meantime, research how to value stocks, how to factor in macroeconomic trends, and get a feel for the market.",0,0.531,1.0,NEGATIVE

Can be part one part the other. Have some exposure to aggressive growth while having a strong/durable core of dividend growers.""dividends are comforting when you get them.""IMO there's way too much faith in dividends in this sub now. The dividend amount is taken out of the share price and people hold names like Ford for the dividend while at the same time the stock price has lost 50% and the total return for the stock is negative on the 3 and 5 year time frame and barely positive for the 10 and 15. Additionally, names like Kraft and GE have shown why people should not be overly comfortable/complacent with dividend names.""cloud stocks like OKTA, TWLO, NOW, AYX, TEAM etc.""I like most of those companies although admittedly a better time for those names was last Fall. SaaS names bounced to end last year and have absolutely ramped in the first few weeks of this year.",0,0.557,1.0,NEGATIVE

The importance of this comment can not be understated. If you’re investing in a dividend company and the company isn’t a dividend growth machine, then you’re missing out on much better opportunities.",1,0.607,0.939,POSITIVE

I only use part of my portfolio for individual stocks because I enjoy it. Look for good buying opportunities for companies you want to own long term. If they happen to pay a dividend that's just a bonus.,0,0.543,0.991,NEGATIVE

You have nice holdings, I'd keep on trucking with it.You could also add stuff like GIS, PEP, Lockheed or maybe a REIT (at a better price), and the like so you pick some dividends and perhaps lower your risks from tech??? It doesn't have to be one or the other.",0,0.518,0.809,POSITIVE

If you don't, go for growth because of tax. If you're young, there probably wouldn't be substantial cash flow anyway for lack of net worth.",0,0.548,0.995,NEGATIVE

Good dividend returns are around 4% annually, which isn't enough to build up your portfolio in the beginning stages when you don't have a lot of capital.If you have limited money (like around 5k-20k to invest), then you're better off building a diverse portfolio of high growth stocks (typically technology stocks.. go with the less risky ones such as Visa, Microsoft, Nvidia is my suggestion as opposed to more risky tech stocks like Tesla, AMD, Netflix is my suggestion.)But with the current market doing so well, albeit fears of an upcoming recession are everywhere, you don't want to miss out on the phenomenal gains individual stocks are getting right now.",0,0.539,1.0,NEGATIVE
