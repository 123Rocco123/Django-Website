,"Hello, I have almost around 200k investment in Robinhood. Last year in September 2023, I moved to Canada and am planning on returning November of this year back to the US. I am not a US citizen but I am a resident for tax purposes until my move to Canada (lived in the US for 8 years on student visa). Robinhood sent me a notice saying that I might be accessing the account from outside of the US and wanted me to verify my current address by October 1st. I tried to chat with a customer agent and they told me they have to close my account and liquidate my account OR transfer my account to another brokerage. I chose Schwab to start the transfer but I am afraid Schwab also might have restrictions about my residency. What are my options here? Should I just not respond to Robinhood and let my account freeze by not responding by Oct 1st and re-open it when i get back to the US in November? Liquidating would mean i will be in a very big tax liability as I probably have to pay tax for the entire gain I made over the years. Is there an international brokrage that i can transfer my account to?",Do an ACAT transfer to Charles Schwab (no tax liabilities) and never deal with the monkeys at Robinhood again.,0,0.513,NEGATIVE,1.0

How about those investments? Am i fine in terms of tax?,1,0.539,NEGATIVE,0.975

I was gonna sell the fractional stock shares as I heard that usually blocks transfer, so I guess i shouldn't try to liquidate them? because then it would mean I did make some money while I was in Canada from some stocks.",3,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.998
