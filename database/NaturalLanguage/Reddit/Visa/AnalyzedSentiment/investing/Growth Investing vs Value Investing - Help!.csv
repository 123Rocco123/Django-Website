,"Hi everyone. I started investing in 2014 with the guidance of my dad. His strategy is to buy safe, dividend paying ""blue chip"" companies. Hold for the long term and turn on a DRIP for the passive income to snowball. Fast forward to now, nearly all my blue chip dividend companies (Enbridge, Bell, Riocan, Emera, etc) have gone nowhere but down or sideways, and the dividend hardly covers the capital losses from the stock price going down. Now obviously I've only been in the game a few years, and I know this is supposed to be a long term strategy. But when I look at growth companies (Microsoft, NVidia, Apple, Visa, Weedstocks etc), I see massive share price appreciation, and the potential money I could have made in growth stocks far exceeds my blue chips by an untold number. Now I'm sitting here with my Blue Chip portfolio all in the red, while I watch my 1 and only growth stock (Canopy) make me more money in 6 months than all my blue chips combined in the last 3 years. How can anyone think Value investing is superior to Growth investing? Please help me understand. I see so much potential in growth stocks, and nothing but ugly charts and red in so-called ""blue chip"" companies. Did I waste my time with this ""dividend growth investing"" strategy? Is this an ""old man"" strategy that typically is used for retiree's, or is it a valid long term strategy that can make as much or more than growth investing?","Get the idea of a safe stock out of your head. Buying 'safe' blue chips isn't safe at all if you're not actually valuing the company. What gives you a margin of safety is buying at a price significantly below intrinsic value.In a bull market, you'll always have some speculative stocks outperforming significantly. That's the nature of the game, but when the party's over, someone's going to be left holding the bag.Lastly, growth and value investing aren't distinct. Believe it or not, some growth can even be value-destroying if return on capital is less than your cost of capital. See Tesla for example.""Most analysts feel they must choose between two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition: ""value"" and ""growth."" Indeed, many investment professionals see any mixing of the two terms as a form of intellectual cross-dressing.We view that as fuzzy thinking (in which, it must be confessed, I myself engaged some years ago). In our opinion, the two approaches are joined at the hip: Growth is always a component in the calculation of value, constituting a variable whose importance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact can be negative as well as positive.""Warren Buffett",0,0.538,0.971,NEGATIVE

Value and growth are essentially Wall Street labels to describe low growth and high growth companies. Value investing, the Buffett or Graham strategy, is the idea of buying a company at a discount to its economic value.

That is, the performance of value stocks (or growth stocks) tends to ebb and flow over the years.

It's to the point that people are asking if ""value investing is dead"". However, long periods of one investing factor or another doing poorly and then doing well is the norm, not the exception.
