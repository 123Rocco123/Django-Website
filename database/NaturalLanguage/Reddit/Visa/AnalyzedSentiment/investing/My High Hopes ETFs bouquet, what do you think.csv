I don’t know the time horizon, what you’re saving for, etc...If you’re trying to hit home runs this might be the portfolio for you. If you want a level of certainty that you will fund whatever you are saving for than this probably isn’t the best plan.",2,0.514,1.0,NEGATIVE

IOT is an annoying buzzword, 3d printing was a flash in a pan, renewables are awesome for those who use them but lousy for those who make and sell them (commoditization). I guess security and mobile payments are somewhat legit.",0,0.515,1.0,NEGATIVE
