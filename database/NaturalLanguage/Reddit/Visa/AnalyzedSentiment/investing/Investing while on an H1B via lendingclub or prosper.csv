,"I've been looking into different ways to make more money off my savings, and one way would be to invest via lendingclub or prosper. One potential limitation is that I am in US on an H1B visa. I am only allowed to work for my current employer, and some potential revenue lines are unavailable to me. For example, I cannot have a second job (without applying for a second H1B), I cannot make music and sell it online, or write a book, or model. I went to lendingclub to see if I could become an investor there, and saw that part of the requirements are that you must be a US person or US resident. This is where things get tricky. Immigration and the IRS have different definitions of what a US person and a resident are. For immigration, an H1B holder is a non-resident alien. For IRS, if you live and work in US for a certain number of days per year (which I do), you are a US person and US resident for tax purposes. I've contacted their corresponding departments, and they seem to ignore the H1B issue, insisting on repeating the wording as stated in their form, but not providing any clarification. Before I create an account with them, I'd like to make sure I can do so legally. Does anybody know? Note: The usual advice for these kinds of things is ""err on the side of caution"": a) get an immigration lawyer or b) best to avoid it altogether. The amounts we are talking about are still relatively limited, and do not warrant getting an attorney involved (it would take more money and more time than the profit I could make in 1 year). If you do not know the answer, please, just don't respond.","I can't offer you any advice to actually solving your issue at hand, although may want to avoid it simply because returns on p2p lending are okay at best. Furthermore, not only are you investing in a particular individual and their ability to repay the loan, but you are also investing in the going concern of the company itself. If they go bankrupt you are a security holder, not an FDIC lender, so you will not get priority for any assets because you didn't technically ""make"" a loan, you bought a security.If you are interested in p2p lending you might just be better off opening a brokerage account and buying shares of a public company (I think LendingClub is public). A quick google of Robinhoods requirements notes they need you to maintain a US address and a valid visa of somekind, and I'm sure other brokerages will work with you as well.",0,0.542,1.0,NEGATIVE

Frankly, you can kiss my ass.I understand that I may sound direct, but I'm also trying to be polite. I ask that you do the same.Whenever any topic like legal advice is touched, people always start recommending a lawyer. Whenever accounting is mentioned, people say ""hire an accountant"". This kind of advice may sound great and sensible to the person who says it, but it actually is pretty impractical for the person receiving the advice. Do you think anyone is going to say ""Oh, wow, I never thought about asking an immigration lawyer"". Assuming that I'm neither smarter nor more stupid than anyone here, then there must be a decent reason why I'm doing it that way.But this issue with people saying ""ask a doctor"" or ""ask a lawyer"" or ""ask a X"" is not just now, not just here. It's something I see everywhere.When people ask about these kinds of things, they are asking for clear evidence in any direction. They are asking to know. And it is reasonable that they do so, and that they ask strangers. I've done a fair amount of research and I've found lawyers positioning themselves in both directions, so the actual answer remains unclear to me to this day. I even have an email from treasurydirect, but I have reason to believe they have not understood the question clearly.This is a forum with many regular readers with a common interest. Chances are I'm not the first person to find himself in this position, and others may know a fact I don't. Perhaps they found clear evidence. Perhaps they did it and got a letter from IRS saying they were in the wrong, or they have been doing this and declaring everything for 5 years and never had an issue.I'm valuing the diversity of the internet, the potential for knowledge we have as a group if we focus on what we know.
