,"Putting a lot of money into the market to keep for awhile (10-20 years) maybe longer. What are your top picks? So far I’ve picked up some Boeing, Apple, visa, J.P. Morgan",S&p500 index is always cheap with a 10 year time horizon. If you aren’t risk adverse I think airlines and some banks are cheap right now. Good luck,0,0.55,0.988,NEGATIVE

Picked up some banks, too scared of the airlines but might have to",1,0.51,0.997,NEGATIVE
,"Putting a lot of money into the market to keep for awhile (10-20 years) maybe longer. What are your top picks? So far I’ve picked up some Boeing, Apple, visa, J.P. Morgan",That’s good. Ya it’s usually easier and more profitable in the long run to just hold VOO instead of stock pick- but to each their own. I bought some $jets at $13 I think it’s easier to bet on the industry recovering instead of 1 firm,2,0.536,0.979,POSITIVE

,"Putting a lot of money into the market to keep for awhile (10-20 years) maybe longer. What are your top picks? So far I’ve picked up some Boeing, Apple, visa, J.P. Morgan","I really like FedEx. <10 P/E. Amazon's entry right now is largely in air-freight. Last mile delivery will remain a massive challenge. Amazon was one of FedEx's least profitable clients and only accounted for 3% of their revenue, so the breakup made sense.Amazon's logistics will largely focus on its own customers. Amazon isn't the only retailer and there's a massive market for FedEx to continue satisfying, especially when it comes to Amazon's competitors.FedEx is trading at $130, less than half of it's ATH of $260+. There's massive upside potential here IMO.",0,0.521,0.995,NEGATIVE

Morgan","It came down a bit in the last two days, and earnings are tomorrow after close. It usually reports a fantastic quarter and drops anyway.I’d feel comfortable scaling in here. But I’m a VEEV bull. It’s always been expensive because it delivers. I think $150-$175 is a decent price. Anything under $140, back the truck up.",2,0.521,1.0,NEGATIVE

,"Putting a lot of money into the market to keep for awhile (10-20 years) maybe longer. What are your top picks? So far I’ve picked up some Boeing, Apple, visa, J.P.

This is a country with organ harvesting of Falun Gong members, Muslim concentration camps, draconian censorship, IP theft, no freedom of speech, no right to a public defender when accused of anything, a business culture that cheats at every turn, etc. Never invest in China unless you condone this shit.",3,0.518,1.0,NEGATIVE

,"Putting a lot of money into the market to keep for awhile (10-20 years) maybe longer. What are your top picks? So far I’ve picked up some Boeing, Apple, visa, J.P. Morgan",I was adding to my apple and visa positions and think they’re great long term companies..with apples new services and all that stuff. Boeing I figured had lost so much value and are too important to go down so I’m investing now and J.P. Morgan seemed like the best bank stock and I kept seeing large funds buying more and more of their stock and it’s pretty far from their highs which I think they’ll return to.,0,0.555,0.871,POSITIVE
