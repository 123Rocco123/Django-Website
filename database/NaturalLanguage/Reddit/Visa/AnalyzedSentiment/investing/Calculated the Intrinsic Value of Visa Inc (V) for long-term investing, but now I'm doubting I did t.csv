,"So I calculated the intrinsic value of Visa inc (V) before deciding if I should invest in the company long-term while benefiting from DRIPs. But the result I got basically told me that Visa is wayyyy overvalued, and I'm curious if anyone out there gets a similar result or I'm not calculating correct at all. My final result was roughly $40.81 Anyone else getting the same number (give or take), or am I calculating this all wrong. Thank you in advance for any responses! My goal is to better identify undervalued companies and not put money into anythings thats overvalued. Edit: Sorry everyone I should've been more clear on how I did my calculation. I used the method in Benjamin Graham's book Security Analysis where I compare the book value of the company 10 years ago and compare it to today's book value, getting the average percent growth annually over the past 10 years. Then factoring in the annual dividend payout, the current book value, average annual growth over the past 10 years, and the current 10 year treasury note.

BV is a poor valuation metric cuz it does not take into account a company's earnings power, growth (and resulting economies of scale), and market share. All it does is look at the balance sheet: assets minus liabilities.Also, tech (and fintech, which V falls under) is one sector that tends to have low BV since their assets are in things that aren't physical objects -- design, patents, software, brand name/value, etc.To put it another way, Ben's BV metric is good for analyzing a company that has huge assets and liabilities and a steady income, like AT&T (humongous fiber optics network with a crap ton of debt that makes money on monthly subscriptions), but horrendous for growth companies that have humongous Total Addressable Markets.",0,0.55,1.0,NEGATIVE
