,"You have Chinese society paying homeless people with Wechat/Alipay using their phones. Some saying they haven't used cash credit cards, or even a wallet, for the last two years! Now add fear of cash created by Coronavirus, Chinese and other governments considering blockchain to replace fiat, Facebook proposing Libra, or even cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (still too little transactions per second though). By the way, Alipay fee for merchants is 0'55%, Wechat 0'6%, while Visa and Mastercard is around 2% of each purchase. And this is only in China, you have similar companies in Brazil, India, South East Asia countries, etc. I only see to two possible scenarios: they lower their fees to compete in this new environment. they heavily invest in updating their business model. Both ways they loose money. Don't get me wrong, I love this companies and have been an investor for more than 12 years in both of them. I'm just a little worried about the world changing so quickly and they don't being able to keep performing as well in the future.","No way. If anything, they are both good to rise.Americans have been slow to adopt chip and pin and contactless. Expect that to change as we emerge from Covid-19. Gesture based and contactless systems will dominate. Cash will be further eroded. These systems are the norm in Europe.Almost all challenger banks issue Mastercards. Pre-pay cards, currency cards, credit builder cards etc are all Mastercard and challenger banks are growing.Mistrust of China is growing and I expect Western economies to start unwinding Chinese suppliers and systems.",0,0.518,1.0,NEGATIVE

Meanwhile, Tencent working with Visa (https://www.scmp.com/tech/apps-social/article/3036688/tencent-joins-hands-major-international-credit-cards-allow-more.)""Facebook proposing Libra""And what happened with that? Both political parties actually joined together for once (their shared hatred of Facebook) and yelled at Facebook's head of payments, then ""strongly suggested"" that members of the Libra group should reconsider being members. If you are a financial entity in this country like Visa and Mastercard, you will face regulation. It's easier to use the rails that are already built - like Apple (who gets a tiny %) figured out - then to have to build the rails yourself and face a shit ton of regulatory scrutiny. If anything, this is a time where you should be looking for opportunities to add to things like Visa and Mastercard; it would not surprise me if the end result of this is a push (and possibly very significant push) away from using cash.",0,0.519,1.0,NEGATIVE

Basically raising capital as a private entity.If you wrote me a cheque for x dollars, it along with all the other cheques written will be sent to my attorney responsible for the financing and documentation. We would deposit those cheques into our attorney’s trust account until the transaction is formally closed and share certificates are issued.So no once your wrote it, it’s all good.
