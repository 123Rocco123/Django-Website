,,"When you start seeing people at the grocery store with Square or Paypal logos on credit cards,then you can start worrying.Not necessarily... the PayPal credit card still needs a payment processor and that payment processor is MasterCard. And, correct if I'm wrong, but Square's cash card is a debit card - not a credit card. If you look at the card, the payment processor is Visa. PayPal and Square currently do not have the technology to process payments without V, MA, DFS, and AXP to name a few.Square applied for a bank charter last year, so IMO Square is best positioned for getting a slice of the Visa/Mastercard monopoly, hence why its one of my largest holdings.How? Unless Square becomes a payment processor, I don't see this being a huge issue in the near term. I bet they applied for that bank charter because they want to continue extending credit to their POS users or something along those lines. Neither V nor MA is a bank... maybe there's something to bank charters I don't understand?Where I think V and MA shareholders need to be concerned is SMBs and consumers figuring out ways to go without Visa or MasterCard. Alipay in China is a great example of consumers and businesses being able to exchange funds without traditional credit card processors V or MA. Another concern is if more companies (Square? PayPal?) help businesses create debit card linked accounts - similar to the Target REDcard™ Debit Card where consumers get 5% off of Target purchases.",1,0.52,0.968,NEGATIVE
,,"technically, visa and mastercard are still the card associations, which work with various issuing/ card banks to provide credit and debit cards. being a bank is a big pain in the ass, that's a business visa and MC just aren't interested in.if square gets a bank charter, they'd likely operate at the other end of the payment ecosystem as a sponsor/ acquiring bank, rather than a card bank to provide credit to their merchants. the big payment processors - first data, global payments, tsys, elavon have chosen not to become banks, so it would be very interesting to see how it works out fr square.",2,0.523,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"One of the posts ITT that reasonates with me. Whats your high level overview on the payments ecosystem e.g. POS to merchant acquirers to payment processorsMy broad understanding is that POS obviously at the start of the chain some systems like paypal are taking the processing aspect away?Otherwise typical credit card transaction would be through Joe Bloggs shop which has signed up via an ""ISO""/merchant acquirer so that he has the right/business bank account, to then accept payment of which broadly it will get processed by one of the processors you mentionted e.g. first data/tsys?",3,0.524,0.896,POSITIVE
,,"a POS is used for what the industry calls a ""card present"" transaction, where you physically have the card and swipe it to make a payment. there's an increasing amount of ""card not present"" which can be like ecommerce, pay by text/ phone, etc. paypal does primarily CNP stuff, but they do offer a card present system for those who want it. however, CNP transactions are typically more expensive to process because of the higher chargeback/ compliance risk.POS hardware was mostly ingenico/ verifone a few years ago, but the payment processors have kind of expanded towards that. first data has their clover system which processes a pretty significant portion of their total volume now, i believe. and of course there's square which kind of started as a POS hardware provider, but then involved into a processor + SMB lender.",4,0.517,0.56,POSITIVE

And, in my view, the opportunity for disruption in the payment processing market is much smaller than in the retail/commercial banking sector. Why? Because VISA and Mastercard already deliver a pretty effective, low-cost service that is delivered using well established global infrastructure.VISA and Mastercard are so deeply embedded within so many existing services (even new Fintech providers) that I don't see a cost-effective challenger coming along.",0,0.54,0.967,POSITIVE

,,"Square's bank charter intent is to be able to offer financial products; eventually Square becomes a hybrid bank. There was a report the other week that even as is more people than expected are using Square's Cash App as a bank account (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/18/square-stumbles-into-the-banking-business.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain). They're already offering loans to businesses that are paid back via the terminal.Also re: Square:""Over 67% of our sellers can't get financing anywhere. And so we are their sole source of financing. And, we think we're able to serve that need effectively because of our data, from the data processing business, and because of our ability to apply machine learning and data science to assess risk. And we think that enables us to serve an underserved market in a way that very few others have.How exactly do you use data from your transactions arm to support your lending decisions?We have extraordinarily unique data in order to do two things. First, determine who is eligible — out of our seller base, and in general. And the second use of our unique data set is to determine the right size of a loan. Both components of using data are incredibly important. [That] is an unusual asset for Square, relative to everyone else.On the data set, we have millions of sellers that provide real-time insights into their business that we are able to underwrite off. We see payments processing data and transactions data. We have all kinds of risk signals that help us understand who should be eligible.The second piece is right loan size. We are able to, based on the transaction data, project forward to what we estimate a business will achieve in revenue. Therefore, we are able to underwrite a right-size loan to provide the right financing to support the stability and growth of a business.And for those who are underserved, it enables them to have the support they need without overfinancing their business operations. We have models which give us guidance on what is affordable. And we think that's a unique data asset that is a powerful indicator for success and growth and also a very strong signal for us to analyze credit.What are some of the data points you put into your model?We have scores of signals that we use. It ranges from everything from transaction size, number of transactions, whether transactions match the type of business that the sellers in, the hours they're open, the velocity of their performance within a given workday.Risk signals include whether the payments that are being processed and the business locations are being processed from some unknown location, whether the transaction sizes are relevant and [whether they are] being processed at the right time of day.Those signals are real time, and they're active constantly. They're not six-month-historical, one-year-historical, one-time checkpoints. They are active and ongoing, because these are Square sellers who have typically been on our system for over two years."" (https://www.americanbanker.com/news/the-story-behind-squares-bank-charter-application)I'm not concerned by Paypal or Square; if anything, I think Square and Paypal (more the former than the latter) are eventually intent on disrupting banking.The one thing in the US that concerns me not in terms of disrupting Visa and Mastercard but that could put a dent in them is Amazon.https://www.paymentssource.com/articles/amazons-checking-account-push-shows-next-target-swipe-fees",0,0.537,0.813,POSITIVE

,,"I hold both Square and Visa to spread out my risk and exposure to different facets of the fintech sector. Visa is such a well ran company and the big credit card and payment processing companies have some pretty solid MOATs. Between having the money, resources, and technology along with tight regulations it’s not an easy industry to get into. Visa has also done pretty well with tapping into international markets and there is still a fair deal of people out there in the world who have yet to use cashless payments.MasterCard and Visa actually operate differently as well. Visa is a payment processors and they make cards for several banks and companies but they don’t actually issue credit. MasterCard is your traditional credit card company that makes cards and provides credit to its users. Both ways have their pros and cons but I think while there may be less rewards with Visa’s method, I think it’s a safer but still well paying type of business to be involved in as they aren’t as susceptible to credit risk and when the economy is hurting. (Edit: Disregard this paragraph, TIL MasterCard also doesn’t issue credit).I like the idea of Square a lot but I still think the company has its work cut out for them. I think they’re great at what they do and definitely serve a need that’s out there but I’m not sure if we’ll ever see them be as successful in being as widely used as something like any of the major card companies today. I think they want to eventually get there and are trying to but I’m not sure exactly how feasible that is. They’re also offering things like payroll services and loans and I think are really trying to become a favorite of small to medium size businesses, which are often underserved or in the past have faced little options in terms of choices.PayPal is a company I just could never get myself to invest in. I’ve been wrong so far but they just seem to get too content at times and at times appear light on the innovative side of things. They seem to start new things but then don’t market them as well as other payment companies and apps do with their products/services out there in my opinion. There is no denying they are a powerhouse in the e-commerce sector and they have made efforts to branch out into other payment and finance services. Their bread and butter is the online shopping payment platforms but they are trying to get into more traditional banking means as well. I thought Venmo was a solid addition and can see platforms like that being widely used if implemented correctly.I do think credit cards and payment processors are facing the most competition they have seen recently or perhaps ever. However, I think there is a lot of room to grow and room for several of them to be successful, including some of the newer and younger companies. Americans love debt and credit usage to a fault, so there should always be money to made. We are also moving more and more away (at times slowly) from cash so I think this will only help everyone involved in the sector. China has a few apps/companies out there that are do really well too.Maybe it’s more common in the city but I haven’t seen in person anyone pay for their groceries, gas, or meals with Square or PayPal like I do every day with any of the major card companies out there. Those companies haven’t become well known and implemented enough yet or they don’t yet have the ability, ease, or advantages of providing such things right now. I do think with smart phones and apps we could see it happen though soon and become more common for the companies right now that have already begun offering such services.To sum it all up, I wouldn’t consider companies like Square or PayPal major threats to companies like Visa or MasterCard but instead as nuisances that will eat into some of their potential and grab some of their growth down the line. There is still a lot of untapped people and markets out there where cash is king for these companies. It’s always tough to bet against companies Visa but you could always put some money in Visa along with one or a few of the up and comers like Square. That’s what I do anyways.",0,0.533,0.697,POSITIVE
