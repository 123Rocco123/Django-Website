,,"I still think the discussion of crypto as a possible disruptor to credit cards is complete fantasy and remains the belief of crypto evangelists who ponder what they'd like to see without any thought towards whether it's realistic or not. Mobile payment adoption in this country has not gone well, but there's this belief that somehow tomorrow there's going to be widespread adoption of people paying for things with one of a thousand different cryptos.People yelled for ages about how ""Apple Pay gonna disrupt Visa"" and that was immensely irritating from the standpoint of those people had apparently put no thought into the idea of what people were using to pay for things via Apple Pay.The main one for me in regards to disruption of cards - and this would not be massive disruption but it would cause real concern - is Amazon getting into financial products.I do like the fact that GE is now so bad that people are using it as a descriptor.",0,0.511,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"It's not a matter of dismissing crypto as an asset class (although the incessant hard selling evangelism around the asset class from many - not you, but many - is a considerable turn-off), it's a matter of the view that I hear constantly of ""crypto gonna replace credit cards imminently."" People are not going to be transacting en masse for all manner of daily transactions in crypto any time soon, if ever.""I see it going mainstream in smaller countries with unstable currencies.""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/03/05/venezuelas-cryptocurrency-is-one-of-the-worst-investments-ever/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.23dc2166c36dI'm very much of the view that an increasing amount of countries will go cashless over the next decade. It becomes what does that look like? I don't see it looking like an economy where people transact in any number of competing crypto currencies. That doesn't mean that I think crypto is a 0 or going away as an asset class. I simply do not see it being the way that people pay for things en masse any time soon, if ever ... but that's just me.",1,0.513,0.999,NEGATIVE

,,Agreed on Amazon. I own both amazon and visa. If amazon can put together a system that bypasses visa/mastercard/discover/amex etc... that could be a problem as amazon continues to grow. gives them even more upside.,1,0.515,0.947,POSITIVE
,,"True, plus it saves them on swipe fees so they have the motivation. I don't think it ends cards by any means but would be a definite worry.",2,0.505,0.996,POSITIVE
,,"blockchain has potential to work alongside different industries, but no way crytpo ever comes even remotely close to visa or mastercard.",2,0.506,0.994,NEGATIVE
,,Umm OK live in delusional land. Apparently you an those downvoting me don't know what real time gross settlement is or how distributed systems work. Can't work without a Crypto asset so you obviously don't know what your talking about.,3,0.514,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,wechat or a law allowing merchants to easily add a discriminatory charge on credit cards,0,0.504,0.998,NEGATIVE
,,"They can add a discount on non-credit card purchases, which amounts to the same thing",1,0.499,0.997,NEGATIVE
,,"I think the scenarios would have to be either one of two things.They do more of a wells fargo situation, or enron situation where they mess up on their own. I am not sure about mastercard, but Visa for instance doesn't carry debt. It just processes the transfers and takes a fee.Another form of payment fills the space. This would not be something like square where they process payments but it would be something like crypto, a cash only marketplace, or we lose electric payment capabilities and we have to use gold/diamonds/copper as sources of currency.",0,0.51,1.0,NEGATIVE
