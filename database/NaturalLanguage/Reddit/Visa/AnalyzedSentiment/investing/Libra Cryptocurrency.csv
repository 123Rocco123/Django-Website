Anyone can start their own validator without permission from Ripple.If any of those nodes does something that RippleInc does not like, it will be immediately removed from the defaulr UNL.The default UNL is a suggested list of validators. If you don't choose your own validators to follow, you default to the default UNL. It's trivially easy to choose your own list of validators, of which NONE can belong to the UNL if you so choose.If RippleInc says ""here is a new release of the software, please upgrade"", the choice that those nodes have is either to upgrade or to drop out of the network.Nodes vote on major updates to begin with, so they have a say on how the network evolves. If you're talking about patching rippled software, then for things like improved performance or requirements that mean if you DON'T upgrade, your server won't sync with the rest - then of course you have to patch rippled for technical reasons.But if eerybody did that, the network would run the risk of splitting or stalling without reaching a consensus .

Learn how validation actually works before making throwaway comments like this. Consensus is strengthened by more nodes in the network as there's a greater diversity of UNLs all reaching consensus. Validators fetch transactions from stock nodes who hold copies of the latest ledger - they analyse these transactions, check hash values and so on and produce a validation result - they compare this result with other validators. They are not merely copying results from one another (this is your major ""theory"" which suggests extra nodes are totally pointless as they just copy/paste their validation results from other nodes - NONSENSE!).Moreover, the lack of PoW and PoS means that it is cheap to rebuild the XRP ledger (blockchain) from any arbitrary block in the past, possibly replacing some already confirmed transactions by other transactions that are incompatible with them.

You said that you can't run a validator without Ripple's permission. Now you're saying you can't get on the default UNL without Ripple's permission.

It is open to public scrutiny. Rippled is open source. You talk like you don't really understand what a blockchain is - as if it's something we can't see. It has a six year history behind it. If the XRPL isn't doing what is claimed in the public domain, you can prove it! You can scrutinse the lines of code in Rippled and show us. For a blockchain to win as much trust as the XRPL has, it HAS to be open like this.Again, that is what RippleInc says. But of course the ledger can be replaced today by a version that reverses transactions confirmed years ago, as if they had never been issued.This is getting boring now, but I will say it again: in the entire list of validator nodes, Ripple operate about 3% of them. Ripple would have to convince at least 77% (of the entire list) to collude with them to get to the 80% majority. That means convincing hundreds of disparate entities (universities, businesses, individuals, associations) to not only commit fraud, but self-sabotage and work 100% against their best interests. Oh, and how does it work out if Ripple fail in this collusion? They have let the cat out of the bag to other node operators that they're willing to write bogus transactions on the ledger...tell me, how does that work out in Ripple's favour here?But isn't the blockchain missing the first 70 blocks or something? So that no one can verify whether it traces back to the genesis block?This missing blocks at the very start PROVES the ledger cannot go back. It's proof of its immutability and that it can only move forward.

Sure there are some people who absolutely need it - but regulators will probably severely limit the amount of funds that can be moved with it. For the rest of the users , it's a second currency. Most people don't walk around with USD and GBP in their wallets, so unless there is some concrete use of it most people won't load their wallets with money.Can it be used as a gateway to converting USD to cryptos? Doubtful, as it will probably be severely regulated too, as in , you can only convert $500 / day or sth.If on the other hand it proves successful for things like microtransactions, then other players (even those that are participants in the Libra) will lower their transaction rates to near zero in order to compete with it. I think, while Libra will hopefully disrupt things, it won't be the final winner of the disruption.Also, isn't it weird that it is being supported by companies that are competing with each other? Seems like they will be walking on eggshells.Another thing, this is an American cross-border stablecoin.

This is a big style approach to the crypto hype, they won't enter through the back door. The list of brands supporting will give it a big use case, and the 2 billion user base is the advantage they need to be successful.If it would be only usable in the US and being backed 1:1 by the dollar, I guess they could just go ahead. I'm expecting that they run into legal issues due to the backing to a basket of currencies, which makes it an own currency somehow, and maybe also due to the cross-border transactions which they are going to support.It's clear that it's a centralized stable coin in the beginning, but I would expect the people to jump on it regardless, because of the lots of real-life use cases they're going to support. Unlike with other crypto, there's no moon or money to earn for speculators, this one is just a currency intended for easy daily use.",0,0.534,0.999,NEGATIVE
