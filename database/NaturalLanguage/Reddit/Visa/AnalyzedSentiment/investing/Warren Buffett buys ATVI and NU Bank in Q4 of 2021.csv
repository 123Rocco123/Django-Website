Berkshire Hathaway did.Todd Combs and Ted Wechsler are the current portfolio managers at Berkshire, under Greg Abel, Vice-Chairman of Non-Insurance operations.Whatever else we think Buffett's logic is, and I consider myself a student of Buffett and Graham's investment approaches, the day to day investment strategy at Berkshire is not managed by him. He deals primarily with the overall capital allocation at the company level at this point and has done so for some time.",0,0.536,0.929,NEGATIVE

An SEC investigation would cause a lot more damage to Berkshire than the roughly $1BB exposure (which has netted around 200-400mm in profit if bought during Q4).I think this is a case of buying when a stock is unfairly punished.If you look at other buying, it's mostly from funds with a value bend.",2,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE

Buffett cares for his reputation, and not appearing improper.He's stated before that the reason Berkshire isn't invested in MSFT, and will likely never in them is because of his close relationship with Bill Gates. At the time he said it Bill Gates was still on MSFT's board, hence Buffett said he worried that people would speculate that he only bought MSFT because Bill Gates whispered to him about some secret insider information.

The problem is what will Zuckerberg decide to do with this money? Will he reinvest it in an unrofitable and very costly metaverse venture? Will he invest in the ecosystem to lenghten its lifespan and fight Tiktok?Right now the consensus is that FB is seriously threatened by Tiktok (which means it will produce FCF for a shorter period of time), and that because it's under this menace Zuckerberg will spend all the money on the metaverse instead of milking the company for as long as he can. The consensus is that the metaverse will be a value destroying project.Basically you should invest in FB if you believe the metaverse investments are not value destroying.

It is now top 10 positions in Berkshire. They increased stake by 33%. CVX isn't a typical long term Berkshire buy but may be we are missing something.
