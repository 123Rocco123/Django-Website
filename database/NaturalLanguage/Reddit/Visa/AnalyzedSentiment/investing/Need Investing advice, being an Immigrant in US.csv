Have a HYSA with SoFi & have a mutual funds account in India that I'm contributing close to $700 per month. I don't have 401K or Roth IRA, since I'm still not sure where I'm gonna end up in, Canada or USA.Also have an auto loan with close to $16K remaining.

Roth accounts may require a letter/election to be sent to the CRA after moving to keep the account benefits.I think Canada resets the cost basis in taxable accounts on the day you become a resident while the US may not have an exit tax on unrealized gains for immigrants that leave, so you may be able to avoid paying tax on unrealized capital gains if you move to Canada.",0,0.526,0.986,NEGATIVE
