,"What's your opinion on payment processing companies (Visa, Mastercard, etc) and blockchain tech? Are these companies successfully adopting?","My opinion is that the discussion of blockchain replacing payment networks is ridiculous.https://pics.me.me/do-i-need-a-blockchain-no-slide-about-blockchains-32052561.png (that's an exaggeration, but an amusing response to the ""blockchain solves everything"" nonsense.)Also, Visa and Mastercard have been adapting just fine to advancements in payment tech, but the discussion of Bitcoin and Blockchain replacing either is absurd and comes more from ""that sounds neat"" or the evangelists who preach about both being ""the best thing to ever happen to mankind"" than ""reality"". It reminds me somewhat of the annoying discussions about how Apple Pay was going to replace Visa - people hollering about ""VISA IN TROUBLE!"" Meanwhile, what do you use with Apple Pay? Visa (or whatever other card.)I think the payments space up and down the ladder from Visa to Square to Paypal and others will see more competition in the years ahead, but I have far less concern over blockchain and bitcoin presenting a threat to Visa than I do Amazon.So the main concern that I have in regards to Visa/Mastercard certainly isn't bitcoin/blockchain - it would be Amazon - and that wouldn't disrupt Visa/Mastercard in a critical way, but enough to cause distress. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-09/amazon-s-checking-account-push-shows-next-target-swipe-fees",0,0.51,0.999,NEGATIVE

,"What's your opinion on payment processing companies (Visa, Mastercard, etc) and blockchain tech? Are these companies successfully adopting?","I don't really see the blockchain as a serious competitor to Visa/Mastercard. Like others have mentioned, Amazon's impact on payment processing matters more.I do think blockchain has promise, but not there.",0,0.504,0.984,NEGATIVE
,"What's your opinion on payment processing companies (Visa, Mastercard, etc) and blockchain tech? Are these companies successfully adopting?","If I gave you the option to to keep all your money in a secure location that you have 100% control over OR an institution that has been known for market manipulation, fees, stealing, and isn't even open on Sundays?Crypto isn't fully fledged, it will be though - in one form or another. When a greater majority start to lose trust in banks and decide to keep their control over their own funds - Vendors like Visa will have to accept it or fade away.This wont happen over night; but think of it like the shift from cash to plastic.",1,0.512,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"What's your opinion on payment processing companies (Visa, Mastercard, etc) and blockchain tech? Are these companies successfully adopting?","Are banks the problem here, or is Visa/MasterCard? Many people don’t understand basic banking practices, yet you expect people to keep and understand crypto wallets? Not happening anytime soon.And that doesn’t even begin to address government regulations, payment infrastructure, unbacked currency issues.",2,0.501,0.995,NEGATIVE
,"What's your opinion on payment processing companies (Visa, Mastercard, etc) and blockchain tech? Are these companies successfully adopting?","You don't need to understand all the in's and out's of a credit card to own one. I didn't say this would be a quick transition. There are still people out there who don't understand the internet and pay all bills in person with checks. Understanding dose not equal adoption, ease of use dose. There are alot of factors, like you stated above, that need to come together, however, if anything Visa and MasterCard should show you that it is possible to change the way we handle money.",3,0.507,0.998,NEGATIVE
,"What's your opinion on payment processing companies (Visa, Mastercard, etc) and blockchain tech? Are these companies successfully adopting?","Some valid comparisons, but it doesn’t go about solving the problems crypto faces. It doesn’t go about solving the original problem either. The point is, people still don’t understand how to use chip cards properly, and many think they are just a hassle, or a gimmick.Can crypto remain at a rather constant value like the USD in banks can? Nobody would want a $100 bill in thier wallet that can be $95 one day, and then $105 the next.Then there’s secondary problems, like if banks don’t receive deposits, how will they give out loans?Don’t get more wrong crypto might possibly have a place, but we won’t know that place for years, maybe even decades. There are so many problems with it to solve first.",4,0.51,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"What's your opinion on payment processing companies (Visa, Mastercard, etc) and blockchain tech? Are these companies successfully adopting?","You can keep control of your funds today, just keep it in cash.No one does that because it is a pain in the ass and you risk getting it lost or stolen... just like bitcoin.",2,0.519,0.983,NEGATIVE
,"What's your opinion on payment processing companies (Visa, Mastercard, etc) and blockchain tech? Are these companies successfully adopting?","When a greater majority start to lose trust in banksThe awareness of manipulation by banks is a pretty common thing in English speaking countries, but I think crypto's largest growth segment isn't people who distrust banks.I think it's people who currently are unbanked, and have no access to the system at all. The rapid economic development of African nations, growth in rural China and India, as well as tanking South American economies will probably be the biggest catalyst for growth in my opinion.",2,0.526,0.721,NEGATIVE
