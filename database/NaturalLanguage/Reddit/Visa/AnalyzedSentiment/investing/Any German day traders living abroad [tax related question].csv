,"Hi guys, I have asked this question on a few forums and subreddits already, but nobody could give me an educated answer. I have somebody here can. I am in the process of filling out the documents for an application for a broker in the US. As part of my application I have to tell the broker where I am going to pay taxes. Once I properly start day trading, I will talk to a tax professional about this, but I am not really keen on spending so much money before I even have a broker. So maybe some of you are in a similar or even the same situation and could share your knowledge. I am a German citizen, am still registered back in Germany and still have my parents' house registered as my place of residence. I have now been living in South Africa since February on a student visa, have a flat here and am most likely going to stay until July 2021. For some of you the answer might be crystal clear, but I am uncertain if I will have to pay taxes in Germany or South Africa. Thanks for any advice. PS: Getting a South African or German broker is not an option.","Hi, welcome to r/investing.
