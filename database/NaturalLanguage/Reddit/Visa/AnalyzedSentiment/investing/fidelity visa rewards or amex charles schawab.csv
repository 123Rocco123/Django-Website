The only drawback is the 550 annual fee with that card.,"Any 2% cashback card is a solid choice. You can do better with optimization and work and research but if you just want to 'set it and forget it' 2% is a great option.Citi Doublecash, Fidelity, PayPal Cashback Mastercard and others all offer this. It doesn't really make any difference where you get the money paid. You can always deposit it into your brokerage account. But I suppose having it sent directly there is a nice perk if you're going to do that anyway.If you want to increase your rewards:Chase Freedom and Discover It are both great cards that have 5% cashback rotating categories each quarter. The quarter ending today has Gas (It) and Groceries (Freedom). Next I think is Restaurants (It) and Gas (Freedom).There are lots of cards that give you 3%+ in a specific category. With usually 1% on everything else. Like the Costco Visa (3% travel and restaurants, 4% gas), Amex BCE (3% groceries), CapitalOne Savor (4% restaurants). Etc etc. The list is endless. The Chase Sapphire Preferred is a very popular card that has great travel rewards. And a huge signup bonus. But it also has an annual fee which should be avoided unless the rewards cover it.If you want to optimize, the best thing to do is use those other cards when you're getting >2% and the 2% card for everything else.The rabbit hole goes much deeper, but that's a good primer. r/churning is a great subreddit for this stuff.",0,0.518,0.999,NEGATIVE

Can help keep ""investing and mid-to-long-term savings"" mentally and functionally separate from ""current banking and short term savings"".If you plan to do margin or options, you have to use the regular brokerage account. But sure, using the CMA for all or part of investing can work.My wife and I did a lot T-bills, brokered bank CDs, Investment-grade Floating Rate Note ETF (FLOT), and similar no-to-low-risk ""investing"" the last couple of years in that CMA as the biggest part of saving up our home down payment. While still using the checking, bill pay, bank sweep intended cash management part of it for a significant portion of where our regular income got deposited and from where we paid bills.It did at times get confusing until we realized the ""account value"" would never ever match the ""available to withdraw"" (or spend) number in the app and site, if we were also using it for investing. That's perhaps a reason for adding the separate investing account, now that there are no barriers to entry for it.",3,0.523,0.558,POSITIVE

Fidelity considers it part of your ""available to withdraw"" cash, as soon as the actual fund Buy order executes at about 8pm. You do have to put in the manual Buy order but that takes all of about 20 seconds in the app or on the site.During the day, after you put in that Buy but befire it executes, your available cash balance looks confusing, and the amount you are about to buy is restricted from withdrawing. But after it executes you're all good.

SIPC insured only, against brokerage failure.Day after deposit, if you do nothing: Overnight was swept into 1 to 4 of the 20 or so FDIC-insured banks on the ""Program Bank List"" that Fidelity chose for you. Pays about 0.37% lately but probably going down soon, just like MMFs , online banks, bank money market accounts, and everything else is.Day after deposit, if you manually bought a Fidelity Money Market Fund: In that fund.Fidelity's brokerage system has near realtime connections to PNC Bank's Visa debit ATM card system (PNC runs the Fidelity debit card) and to UMB Bank's checking and ACH banking systems (UMB runs the checkbook and routing / checking number part of it). Meanwhile Fidelity considers all of those three types of places cash can be, including their own funds and the 20 or so sweep banks, all part of your cash. And Fidelity knows and controls how much of your cash is in each bank and can pull it back in overnight.So when Visa or an ATM network go to authorize a withdrawal or charge by asking PNC if PNC has enough money to cover it, PNC instantly asked that to Fidelity Brokerage, Fido adds up the total of the cash credit balance, cash swept out to banks, cash value in Fido money markets, and tells PNC ""Sure, authorize it."" Then when the charge or debit actually processes through PNC to Fidelity, that night Fidelity auto-sells some or all of your Fidelity Money market funds, if after telling the sweep banks to send the money back to Fido there still isn't enough.Priority 1) cash credit net balance, 2) pull back money from FDIC banks, 3) sell Fidelity money market funds.And that's how Warren Buffett's Geico gecko got my insurance premium paid by autopay on my Fidelity Visa, even though all the money in the account was in SPRXX, as a real world example. The day the Geico charge posted, Fidelity did an auto-sell of the exact amount needed from the money market fund.But when I got some client payments in via PayPal to Fidelity, I did have to do the Buy.order to get it into 2% SPRXX instead of 0.37% FDIC sweep. On a regular Fidelity trading account I could have chosen that or another fund as the automatic core fund. But that account wouldn't have the free bill pay and ATM rebates for non high balance accounts, while the CMA does.Tradeoffs.
