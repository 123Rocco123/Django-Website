,"Let me thank you in advance for reading my post. Your opinion or advice can change my life at this moment. I‚Äôm from Bolivia in South America, I‚Äôm 20 years old currently at University in the major of Physics. No income and the university is just 4$ dollars per semester. Just recently my father retired from the police and he‚Äôs really exhausted because of the 30 years of unstoppable working routing. We had a conversation days ago and he asked me if I wanted to do something with the money he saved through these years. He said there‚Äôs about 60,000$ in the bank that I can use to do something. We have no debts nor a mortgage. I have to be clear, I have never focused on things related to the financial world because I was always reading about science. However, after this talk we had I started my research about things that are possible to do for someone in my place. Of course there was always the idea of starting a new business, but the problem is that in my country to do that it is really hard because of the amount of restrictions, high taxes; for any kind of business, huge time gap to get the papers needed or the money under the table you need to pay for papers and controls, that exist one time the business had open. There are more small reasons, the point is that business is out. As my father's only condition is having at least 3% of net income per month in order to give me that money. I thought about making money on the internet, that's how I came here and learned more about bonds, stock, etc.. Sadly, most of the specific information is focused on other countries and doesn‚Äôt help me to be clear. Still I can have an idea of the options I have with this money. I‚Äôve already done the analysis using the ‚Äòpersonal income spending flowchart‚Äô, provided in personal finance, for all the members of my family. As a conclusion, 2,5% net income of the 60K dollars is enough to us per month even using the 50/30/20 rule. I need to add that my father has a house that is about 320k dollars and can be quickly sold for 250k; and he said that if I reach 5% net income average in anything I do, he will sell it and give me the money to keep doing whatever I choose. In brief, what I would like to know is: First of all, is it even realistic for me that I‚Äôm just starting to learn about this world to aim for a goal of 5% net income? If you think it is not, then maybe this ‚Äòopportunity‚Äô is not for me. But, if I don‚Äôt give up with this idea, is it possible to reach that net income of 3% on the internet in my country? If you don‚Äôt know or you think it is not a good idea to try that while being here, what about in the USA? I have an aunt there and she has a nice business in NY, so I do have the option of getting the work visa to go there with the money even if taxes were involved. In this case I would quit university and, if possible, I will continue after establishing a secure income (5% per month). Please if you need more information related, in order to give your opinion or advice, feel free to ask.","While I can't speak very knowledgeable about Bolivia and knowing very little about your personal circumstance and apitude, I would suspect that having a degree is better than not having it , like anywhere else. So my opinion is finish degree should be #1 priority. Get a degree in finance/accounting, some business sector to maximize your knowledge towards your goal.As a new entrant to this space AND coming to reddit to ask advice, I think 5% is aiming insanely high. 3% is also high high.Park your family money somewhere ridiculously safe until you are confident and knowledgeable enough to not squander it foolishly.The world is coming into a very cautious time for investing, starting business type area, even in USA. Recessions, debt, inflation everywhere. In US and Europe, they arnt used to inflation like you may be.After finish Uni, the environment should look a lot better and you'll be a lot wiser for it.Good luck üëç",0,0.528,0.998,NEGATIVE

So for this level is where personal opinions and such will differ. My number 1 investing rule investing my parent's money is ""do not to lose money"", secondary to that is make money. so my opinion is more conservative than others. 0$ profit is better than -1$ for my parents.I heard a quote once ""there is a time to make money and a time to not lose money"". I think now is the second.So my parents I have been buying up government bonds and some corporate bonds and I sold a decent portion of their stocks, even safe stocks like cocoa cola.I am not familiar with bolivias govt stability and corporate situation, such for their bonds. Investing in foreign companies usually comes with tax implications with can be another hurdle for newcomers.Some questions: Do you have bank savings accounts that earn yield? Can you buy Bolivia govt bonds and be assured of payment? What tax implications are there for buying USA treasuries or other foreign assets as a Bolivian?My knowledge is off here so a completely made up example:You buy Coca-Cola and get a 3% dividend annually. But then you owe tax on that making your return only 1%. A savings account in bolivia would yields 2% and tax cuts it to 1.5%. That is still 0.5% better return.You have me super interested now.

However, after this talk we had I started my research about things that are possible to do for someone in my place. Of course there was always the idea of starting a new business, but the problem is that in my country to do that it is really hard because of the amount of restrictions, high taxes; for any kind of business, huge time gap to get the papers needed or the money under the table you need to pay for papers and controls, that exist one time the business had open. There are more small reasons, the point is that business is out. As my father's only condition is having at least 3% of net income per month in order to give me that money. I thought about making money on the internet, that's how I came here and learned more about bonds, stock, etc.. Sadly, most of the specific information is focused on other countries and doesn‚Äôt help me to be clear. Still I can have an idea of the options I have with this money. I‚Äôve already done the analysis using the ‚Äòpersonal income spending flowchart‚Äô, provided in personal finance, for all the members of my family. As a conclusion, 2,5% net income of the 60K dollars is enough to us per month even using the 50/30/20 rule. I need to add that my father has a house that is about 320k dollars and can be quickly sold for 250k; and he said that if I reach 5% net income average in anything I do, he will sell it and give me the money to keep doing whatever I choose. In brief, what I would like to know is: First of all, is it even realistic for me that I‚Äôm just starting to learn about this world to aim for a goal of 5% net income? If you think it is not, then maybe this ‚Äòopportunity‚Äô is not for me. But, if I don‚Äôt give up with this idea, is it possible to reach that net income of 3% on the internet in my country? If you don‚Äôt know or you think it is not a good idea to try that while being here, what about in the USA? I have an aunt there and she has a nice business in NY, so I do have the option of getting the work visa to go there with the money even if taxes were involved. In this case I would quit university and, if possible, I will continue after establishing a secure income (5% per month).

When money stays invested for 5-10+ years, you can expect that it will recover (on average) from periods where the market is down. If you are pulling money out regularly to fill a budget, market downturns hit you much much harder and the returns you can generate will be less than half of if you can just leave the money sitting in place while the markets recover.If your father wants a monthly income from stocks, you are an entire order of magnitude off from a reasonable goal. 0.3% per month is doable. 1.5% is absurd unless you are doing some kind of business yourself where you add value through your skills and labor.However, if you can let the money sit in place without touching it, you could reasonably expect an average growth of more than double that, maybe something like 0.7%‚Ä¶ still less than half of your father‚Äôs goal, but not as far off.My recommendation is to help your father understand that his expectations for returns are far out of line with what can be expected from money invested passively. It‚Äôs important to recognize that if he is asking you to bring in these types of returns for his investments, he might also be vulnerable to scammers who could match his high expectations with worthless promises and then squander or steal the money. Worst case, someone could pretend to be earning the high value of 5% a month and then run away with his home equity once they ‚Äúunlock‚Äù that. You need to help your father understand that expectations as high as his are actually dangerous because it makes him vulnerable to scams such like Ponzi schemes.",2,0.529,0.999,NEGATIVE

That is: why should you be the one to manage your family's money? 1) I get the feeling that you want to do good by them, which is admirable. But that's an incredible amount of stress on you during an important time in your life. 2) If things do well, you apparently make some profit and get your family's approval. But if things are anything but amazing, it could foster resentment because you'd be losing THEIR hard-earned lifetime savings, not YOUR money. You have to examine whether the pros outweigh the cons. 3) This ask of your family's is at risk of completely derailing the path that you chose for yourself. When you are on your deathbed, will you regret more going on this path, or going on the psychics path? 4) The need of x% per month is going to be very difficult to achieve. I would never say it's impossible, because people can be very lucky. But think of how lucky you would have to be for it to be sustainable. Even if you think of just 1% per month, that is an average annual needed return of about 13% (remember that the 1% would otherwise compound). That is roughly 2x the average rate of return in the US stock market.I think you have to take a hard look and see if this is a reasonable thing for your family to ask of you at this stage in your life, and you have to decide whether you are going to choose to prioritize YOUR life, or THEIR life.",0,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE

If you don‚Äôt know or you think it is not a good idea to try that while being here, what about in the USA?

I‚Äôm from Bolivia in South America, I‚Äôm 20 years old currently at University in the major of Physics. No income and the university is just 4$ dollars per semester. Just recently my father retired from the police and he‚Äôs really exhausted because of the 30 years of unstoppable working routing. We had a conversation days ago and he asked me if I wanted to do something with the money he saved through these years. He said there‚Äôs about 60,000$ in the bank that I can use to do something.

However, after this talk we had I started my research about things that are possible to do for someone in my place. Of course there was always the idea of starting a new business, but the problem is that in my country to do that it is really hard because of the amount of restrictions, high taxes; for any kind of business, huge time gap to get the papers needed or the money under the table you need to pay for papers and controls, that exist one time the business had open.

In brief, what I would like to know is: First of all, is it even realistic for me that I‚Äôm just starting to learn about this world to aim for a goal of 5% net income?

If you think it is not, then maybe this ‚Äòopportunity‚Äô is not for me. But, if I don‚Äôt give up with this idea, is it possible to reach that net income of 3% on the internet in my country? If you don‚Äôt know or you think it is not a good idea to try that while being here, what about in the USA? I have an aunt there and she has a nice business in NY, so I do have the option of getting the work visa to go there with the money even if taxes were involved. In this case I would quit university and, if possible, I will continue after establishing a secure income (5% per month).

However, after this talk we had I started my research about things that are possible to do for someone in my place.
