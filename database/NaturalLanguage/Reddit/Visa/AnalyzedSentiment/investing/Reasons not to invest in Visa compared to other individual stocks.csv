,Hi r/investing. Just trying to learn a bit more. I’m still a bit of a noob though. Here’s my reasoning why I think Visa is a great investment: A lot of companies try and create value and then get between the transaction (ad companies for example). Visa (and other CC companies) are the perfect middleman. Electronic payments are just not going to go away Visa has a lower PE ratio than MasterCard (37 vs 46) so there’s more room for growth with Visa I’m curious what you think are reasons not to invest in Visa compared to other individual stocks? Thanks for taking the time to read my post.,I have V on my radar. It's definitely got something going for it on the bullish side. I would like a pullback though to buy in.,0,0.523,0.997,POSITIVE

Thanks for taking the time to read my post.,Revenue growth for the past three years has been about 10%. So it’s not worth the current 30+ forward and TTM PE unless you think it can accelerate the growth rate. Profit growth in the long run cannot out pace revenue growth.,2,0.568,1.0,NEGATIVE
