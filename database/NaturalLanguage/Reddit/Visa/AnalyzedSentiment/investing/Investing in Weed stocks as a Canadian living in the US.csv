,I remember seeing articles about people being barred from entering the U.S. because they were investors in the weed industry. Most of the articles I've found are from when weed first got legalized in Canada. I quickly looked at the CBP website but I wasn't able to find an official position. Is traveling to the U.S. as a Canadian citizen who invests in weed stocks still an issue? I'm a U.S. visa holder with Canadian Citizenship.,There was a good article in this months Fortune Magazine about TLRY and their founder Brendan Kennedy. They spoke about travel and didn’t mention that type of restriction. How would they know where your money is invested?,0,0.518,0.999,NEGATIVE

It makes sense that they would be looking for the actual drug being carried across the boarder and it’s possible that he disclosed his investments. Interesting story.

Personally 10% of my portfolio is in weed stocks. Granted my portfolio is fairly small compared to most but I think that a small bet on 2-3 weed stocks with a small portion of your portfolio is a nice high risk high reward type of investment. Cannabis is a big time emerging market. Definitely one you want to be invested in but not one you want to put too much of your portfolio in.Overall I would recommend 10-25% investment into this sector (depending on how much risk you are willing to take on, I am a more conservative investor so I only put in 10%) overall I think it is a sector that is worth getting in at least a little bit now.",0,0.531,0.977,POSITIVE
