,"I am a little confused about a part of their business model. So say I get a credit card from MasterCard or Visa that is sponsored through my bank (Bank of America). Lets say I were to default on my credit card debt, who is on the hook for the unpaid debt? MasterCard/Visa or my Bank? What role if any does a bank play? Who gets to keep the high APR, the bank or MasterCard/Visa? Thanks to anyone who takes the time to answer!","Take a look at MA’s Annual Report and this will all become clear. The banks issue the cards, take all the risk and keep most of the value in the chain. The card networks (V, MA) provide the infrastructure that enables transactions to take place between consumers and merchants.These businesses are really wonderful examples of the power of network effects. I’d recommend learning more about them.",0,0.519,0.999,POSITIVE

So if there were to be another financial crisis like we saw in 2008/2009 it would be the banks who take the hit on the defaults, V and MA don't get screwed over if a cardholder defaults on payments?",1,0.507,0.584,NEGATIVE

Their earnings are linked to the volume of consumer spending.Worth having a look at what happened to their revenues and profits around the time of the crisis.",2,0.527,0.778,NEGATIVE

I bought MA last year and I am up 33% percent on it but I am realizing that I am up by dumb luck. I didn't do the true DD, I thought MA get's a cut of the insanely high APR their cards can charge. I thought this because American Express backs their own line of credit they give out, so I figured all card companies did the same.",3,0.543,1.0,NEGATIVE
