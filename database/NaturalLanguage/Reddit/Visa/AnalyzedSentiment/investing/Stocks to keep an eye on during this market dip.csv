,"Hi all, long time lurker here and I've found this subreddit to be tremendously useful! With the recent tech stock beatdown, here are some of the stocks I am eyeing and looking to buy: Corsair (CRSR) : had stellar earnings and they make fantastic products in the gaming and PC hardware space. They're making good acquisitions in the streaming space. Salesforce (CRM) : another solid company that has taken a big beating for no apparent reason. They recently acquired Slack and I dont see any other competitor being remotely close in the CRM space. Square (SQ): revolutionizing payments for small businesses. Cloudflare (NET): yet to turn profitable but a great tech company that is growing rapidly. Snowflake (SNOW): another tech company that was overvalued upon IPO and climbed all the way to $429 before being brought back to earth. Currently trading at $213 Costco (COST): solid company that has a loyal following and great business model. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM): market leader in chip manufacturing and with the current shortage in chips, their future looks great. Teladoc (TDOC): one of the big companies in the telemedicine space that should thrive in the post covid world as more patients want the convenience of seeing their doctor from the comfort of their own home. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY): pharma giant that made key acquisitions recently (Celgene and Myokardia) that should boost their pipeline and revenue. Also pays good dividend. Facebook (FB) : social media giant that isn't going away anytime soon. Would be interesting to see how they leverage Oculus to boost their revenue. CVS (CVS) : pharmacy giant that should get a boost from covid vaccine rollout and their new in-house clinics. Tattooed Chef (TTCF): fast growing company in the plant based protein and healthy frozen foods space. They have products in almost all major retailers and are rapidly expanding. Nvidia (NVDA): leader in GPU space and a tech giant. Palantir (PLTR): big data company with a revolutionary product that is just getting started. Qualcomm (QCOM): makes chips for phones and are well established for the 5G Era American Tower Corp (AMT): they make/ rent out cell signal towers and should benefit from the move to 5G Planet13 Holdings (PLNHF): they make giant superstores for Marijuana sale and are set to have their own brand of products Of course I would also add Apple, Visa, Microsoft, and Amazon if they dipped enough. What stocks did I miss? Are there any others you would suggest keeping an eye on during the recent sell-off? Thank you!",Pretty much all chip manufacturers have taken a pretty big kick in the dangly bits the past couple of weeks. I'm trying to decide if now is a good time to pick up TSM.,0,0.54,0.979,POSITIVE

We all know that there's a shortage right now. Is that all due to production restrictions due to COVID? What are the paths to growth and are they sustainable? I mean, will there be a reversion-to-the-mean in production volumes once vaccines are fully rolled out in a few months? In that case, are inflated valuations (at least, higher than that pre-covid) really justifiable?Not a financial advisor/not financial advice. AAPL, AMD, INTC shareholder.",1,0.542,1.0,NEGATIVE

What stocks did I miss? Are there any others you would suggest keeping an eye on during the recent sell-off? Thank you!",My thoughts also. I think people are also kinda forgetting there was an over supply of semis not to long ago. So are we starting to see a bit of a plateau? Perhaps not a sharp peak but a tapering off of growth for the late comers? Or is there still plenty of room for growth. I'm kinda torn on it personally,2,0.557,0.993,NEGATIVE

,"Hi all, long time lurker here and I've found this subreddit to be tremendously useful! With the recent tech stock beatdown, here are some of the stocks I am eyeing and looking to buy: Corsair (CRSR) : had stellar earnings and they make fantastic products in the gaming and PC hardware space. They're making good acquisitions in the streaming space. Salesforce (CRM) : another solid company that has taken a big beating for no apparent reason. They recently acquired Slack and I dont see any other competitor being remotely close in the CRM space. Square (SQ): revolutionizing payments for small businesses. Cloudflare (NET): yet to turn profitable but a great tech company that is growing rapidly. Snowflake (SNOW): another tech company that was overvalued upon IPO and climbed all the way to $429 before being brought back to earth. Currently trading at $213 Costco (COST): solid company that has a loyal following and great business model. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM): market leader in chip manufacturing and with the current shortage in chips, their future looks great. Teladoc (TDOC): one of the big companies in the telemedicine space that should thrive in the post covid world as more patients want the convenience of seeing their doctor from the comfort of their own home. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY): pharma giant that made key acquisitions recently (Celgene and Myokardia) that should boost their pipeline and revenue. Also pays good dividend.

Their new CPU line is rumored to be crap, but the specs of their new line of GPUs just got leaked and it looks like they'll be competing at the mid-range (around the level of a 2070 super or a 3060), which there's a massive shortage of right now. If they can drop a passable graphics solution for desktops and they aren't plagued with supply issues like AMD and NVIDIA they could really pick up.My hope is that I can cash out my corsair stocks right around when Intel's CPU line flops, buy lots of cheap intel, then take a gamble on it going way up when the GPUs drop in Q4.

,"Hi all, long time lurker here and I've found this subreddit to be tremendously useful! With the recent tech stock beatdown, here are some of the stocks I am eyeing and looking to buy: Corsair (CRSR) : had stellar earnings and they make fantastic products in the gaming and PC hardware space. They're making good acquisitions in the streaming space. Salesforce (CRM) : another solid company that has taken a big beating for no apparent reason. They recently acquired Slack and I dont see any other competitor being remotely close in the CRM space. Square (SQ): revolutionizing payments for small businesses. Cloudflare (NET): yet to turn profitable but a great tech company that is growing rapidly. Snowflake (SNOW): another tech company that was overvalued upon IPO and climbed all the way to $429 before being brought back to earth. Currently trading at $213 Costco (COST): solid company that has a loyal following and great business model. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM): market leader in chip manufacturing and with the current shortage in chips, their future looks great. Teladoc (TDOC): one of the big companies in the telemedicine space that should thrive in the post covid world as more patients want the convenience of seeing their doctor from the comfort of their own home. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY): pharma giant that made key acquisitions recently (Celgene and Myokardia) that should boost their pipeline and revenue. Also pays good dividend. Facebook (FB) : social media giant that isn't going away anytime soon. Would be interesting to see how they leverage Oculus to boost their revenue.

The 2021 share is probably much higher....To add to that: a lot of organizations are in the process of or planning to get rid of SAP because it’s causing a lot of pain (I’m being very polite here).
