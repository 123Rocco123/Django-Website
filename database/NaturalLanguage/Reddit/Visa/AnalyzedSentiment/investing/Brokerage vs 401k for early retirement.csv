,"Hi, I'm living in California with H1B visa and earning $130k. I have a naive goal of retiring early. I don't think I can take the stress of working this hard until I'm old so I want to achieve some form of financial freedom. My employer does not match 401k contributions. Since I do not have a green card and I want to ""retire"" much earlier than 59, I'm trying to understand if investing in 401k even make sense for me. What's the point if I cannot even withdraw the money before I'm 59? My other concern is even though I know very well that I wanna live in US, I do not have a green card and my parents back in my home country are not getting any younger... So I don't know what life will throw at me. Any suggestions?","Roth IRA before brokerage.Not sure about the 401k in your situation. IIRC non residents still pay USA income tax on retirement plan withdrawals. If you have only the 401k withdrawals you could keep them in the lower brackets. So you could pull the standard deduction amount (currently 15k for single filer) and pay no taxes if 59.5 years old. Even if you withdrew earlier you would pay only the 10% penalty and that should be lower than what you pay now. I don't know what India would want though.One thing I would do before leaving the country is move to another state with no income tax and cut ties completely with California to avoid state income tax.Find an accountant and/or lawyer that knows the tax laws in both countries. Shouldn't be hard in California, you aren't the only one planning this.",0,0.508,NEGATIVE,1.0
