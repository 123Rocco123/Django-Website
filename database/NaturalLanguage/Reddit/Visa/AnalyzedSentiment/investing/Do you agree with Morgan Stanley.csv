Overwatch, heroes, and most importantly hearthstone all depend on lootboxes for profitability. We are in the midst of a broad change of policy regarding lootboxes in the EU. EA is devoting major resources to a losing fight because of how important lootboxes are to profitability.Overwatch league was outshined by the battle royale genre completely. The rest of Blizzard's games are niche and do not compete with other titles/developers on the esport level. Right now esport competition is the single most important thing to contributing to a games popularity. ATVI has proved time and time again that they are not willing to meet industry standards in regards to esports. As a result the popularity of Blizzard games has inevitably faltered.This isn't even to mention that the general sentiment regarding Blizzard games is that they are getting worse and that devs/management are out of touch. Most notably the flop that was Battle for Azeroth, sommonly reffered to by players as ""Beta for Azeroth"". Blizzard devs are hosting a Livestream to explain themselves and ease player tensions next week. I'm really interested to see how the newest expansion affected dau's/mau's and how it compares to legions affect on the same metrics.Finally you have industry disruptors behind every corner. Epic isn't even a publicly traded company and they are dominating the micro transaction game right now. Epic has created a market that they are able to generate demand for that doesn't make players angry. If a private company like Epic can dominate such an important part of what makes the industry profitable then large companies like ATVI and EA don't have the advantage larger companies in other industries are afforded.

You sayThis isn't even to mention that the general sentiment regarding Blizzard games is that they are getting worse and that devs/management are out of touch.But two of their last game releases (Hearthstone and Overwatch) are two of their all-time best releases. WoW is a niche game, given that its 14 years old and the fanbase is overenthusiastic and ravenous so I'm not going to get too worried there.That said, Activision is WAYYYY overvalued. And the reason is this: people have come to believe that game companies are growth tech companies, but they are actually cyclicals. They get super profitable towards the end of a console release cycle, then they miss and underperform when new consoles come out. Thats the risk with ATVI - its not that they are making worse games (which is irrational nerd zeitgeist) its that a new console comes out and they cant position to take a huge share of that market.Imagine is the next console leans heavily on VR or mobile gaming. EA and activision will struggle as their products are all living room/battlestation works of art. Without being able to control the platform, game companies carry serious platform risk.I'll buy ATVI after it takes a hit when new consoles are released.",1,0.553,0.964,POSITIVE
