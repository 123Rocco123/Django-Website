,"Yesterday I listened to this very interesting podcast ( We Study Billionaires - TIP295: Mohnish Pabrai on Value Investing & Philanthropy) where Mohnish Pabrai mentions what he calls secret compounders. The concept sounds very interesting to me, the company that compounds earnings like Visa or Mastercard, but doesn't demand the premium yet, since market doesn't know it yet. He mentions his investment in Fiat - Chrysler (FCAU) where he thought that Ferrari (RACE) alone is worth the whole company due to this reason. I have been thinking about it since yesterday, but I couldn't think of any. I also tried to identify some requirements for such a company. Low P/E: goal is obviously to find the ones that haven't appreciated in value yet, since Mr. Market doesn't know about or doesn't value their compounding ability yet. So they have to have earnings and P/E multiple growth potential. If they have high P/E I can just buy V or MA, where I am sure of their copounding ability. Addresable market that they dominate and is also growing, enabling the future growth of the company. High operating and net margin that signal strong moat and ability to earn a lot of money which they then reinvest in the bussines. Scalability without increasing costs; costs percentage should be decreasing considerably with scale. Something like Saas is the best representation of this. Reinvested earnings are effective at raising revenue. If company is just investing a lot of money, but there is no growth, then they lack compounding ability imo (like IBM for example). These are just a few points that I am not even sure that apply so I would like to get your opinion. What criteria should we use to figure our if the company is a secret compunder? And do you have any ideas which companies would that be and why? To me, the closest I could think of is Cisco (CSCO). They generate huge cash flow, have great balance sheet and pay nice and sustainable dividend. However, this doesn't make them a compunder, but just a nice company to invest in. Their shift from legacy business to Saas could make them one, but only if they are successful in making it a larger part of their revenue. This would increase their earnings power and also make their revenue more predictable, warranting P/E multiple expansion. I appreciate any feedback :)","High R&D spend, high sales spend usually good.I like to look at segments - a small segment (25% of the revenues) growing at 40% owing to a new blockbuster product while their main business (75% of the revenues) declining 10% looks bad on paper as revenue declines but once the small segment passes the large one or they sell off the legacy business it'll be clear that they have a great business growing crazy fast and stock will rerate to high multiples of sales rather than low multiples of PE. Happens a lot",0,0.567,0.516,NEGATIVE
