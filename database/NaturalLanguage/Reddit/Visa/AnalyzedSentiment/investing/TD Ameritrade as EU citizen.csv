,Is it possible to sing up for TD Ameritrade as an EU citizen. They seem to require visa or something. If i can't sign up what good alternatives should i use.,"IB has a fairly extensive research offering and many extras for additional fees. DeGiro is execution only.For a European investor, the main advantages of these discount brokerages are low costs and access to both American and European markets. This is something that few American platforms offer - even if they do offer accounts to Europeans. Domestic brokers and banks in many European countries, on the other hand, might have reasonable commissions for trading on domestic and EU markets - but extortionate fees for trading on American ones.For screening and research, many Europeans rely on 4-traders (a global alternative to the U.S. focused Finviz), and supplement it with local business news outlets in their native language.",2,0.521,0.641,NEGATIVE
