,"From my point of view, the companies are very similar yet have a $60 difference in stock cost. Visa = $130. MasterCard = $190. Which would you purchase and why?",If the $60 difference in share price is something that makes any bit of difference to you then you should not own individual stocks.Read up more on investing and wait until you have enough money that individual share price isn‚Äôt a concern.,0,0.542,0.995,NEGATIVE

,"From my point of view, the companies are very similar yet have a $60 difference in stock cost. Visa = $130. MasterCard = $190. Which would you purchase and why?",Of course. The way OP phrased the post though it seems like he thinks that the actual stock price is indicative of the value of the company (rather than the market cap).Also an investment decision should probably not come down to selecting a stock because you are more comfortable with a lower cost per share. Generally a bad idea unless you want a relatively small position that you can sell small portions of at any given time.,2,0.566,1.0,NEGATIVE
