,"The Portuguese golden visa investment scheme is an interesting way of getting property, and a EU residency. Low risk is my opinion.",If it's low risk does it really qualify as a scheme?,0,0.501,0.975,NEGATIVE
,"The Portuguese golden visa investment scheme is an interesting way of getting property, and a EU residency. Low risk is my opinion.",Scheme doesn't carry the same stigma in the UK and largely Europe.,1,0.516,0.818,POSITIVE
,"The Portuguese golden visa investment scheme is an interesting way of getting property, and a EU residency. Low risk is my opinion.",Thanks for the clarification. IMO it's a pretty large price tag. 250k?,2,0.516,0.707,NEGATIVE
,"The Portuguese golden visa investment scheme is an interesting way of getting property, and a EU residency. Low risk is my opinion.","350kEUR for access to the entire EU? Its not a fee its lending at worst. Its 1.5USD million for the United States last I checked. 50,000USD for the Philippines 800,000USD for Japan. I think 350,000 is certainly reasonable.",3,0.532,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"The Portuguese golden visa investment scheme is an interesting way of getting property, and a EU residency. Low risk is my opinion.","Yeah I still think it's a lot. For citizens of many countries, you already get 90 out of a 180 day period visa free. So 6 months free, then 350k for the other 6 months? There are many, many, easier, ways to obtain a visa for longerEdit to add: To compare, since I looked this up earlier today. Visa (permanent resident) for Ukraine is 100k, and borders many EU countries. You don't even need to invest it into specific funds, it just needs to go to a Ukrainian business (ie one you set up yourself).",4,0.53,0.981,NEGATIVE
,"The Portuguese golden visa investment scheme is an interesting way of getting property, and a EU residency. Low risk is my opinion.",Its not for first world passport holders. Many countries do not have the option to walk around Europe for 6 months no questions. Sure you could go to school and learn to be a doctor and get a residency. Or you could just be a wealthy Chinese person. Even if you were a resident of Urkraine so what? Can you enter and live in the EU no questions?,5,0.521,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"The Portuguese golden visa investment scheme is an interesting way of getting property, and a EU residency. Low risk is my opinion.",It's actually entirely for first world passport holders and is a convenience fee. It's too much for too little.,6,0.52,0.999,NEGATIVE
,"The Portuguese golden visa investment scheme is an interesting way of getting property, and a EU residency. Low risk is my opinion.",I don't think you can purchase residency any cheaper than that. If you need it. Its cool otherwise why waste your time?,0,0.517,1.0,NEGATIVE
