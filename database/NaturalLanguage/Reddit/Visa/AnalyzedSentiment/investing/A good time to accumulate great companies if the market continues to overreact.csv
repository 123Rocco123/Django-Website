,"Since the moderators request that my post to be more thought-out, I am going to be more thorough in my explanation. The market has been quite volatile over the past week, especially during Thursday and Friday. However it is in my view that that some great companies have been punished too severely. For example, Nike is down 25% and Starbucks is down 22% from its peak in February. The following are the reasons I think this market sell-off is perhaps too severe. China has shown that this problem (Covid-19) can be solved (fixable problem), as seen here(https://assets.empirefinancialresearch.com/uploads/2020/03/031320-EFD-Chinas-Coronavirus-Cases-vs.-SSE-Composite-Index-1.png) The economy is doing well and unemployment rate is very low in the US. There is no extreme leverage by banks, so unlikely to have large scale bailouts.* -* I understand that some airlines, hotels are likely to go bankrupt, but my point is why should great companies like Nike, Starbucks, Visa, Disney be down so significantly? You might say that their stores (Nike, Starbucks) might close, like Apple has already done, but this is largely temporary. So I think if the market continues to fall, it would be a great opportunity to buy companies like Amazon, Facebook, Visa, Nike, Starbucks because this Covid-19 phenomenon is largely temporary and the underlying business of these companies is still very strong. Nike and Starbucks are doing very well in China and their growth largely comes from China. So even if the US economy goes into a recession, and that's a big if, China will continue to buy Nike products and drink Starbucks coffee. So while the stock might get punished, as long as continues to use the DCA method in buying them, one can make a lot of money, as long as one is patient. The same is true for Visa and Disney and many other great companies and now is a good time to buy these companies if the market continues to panic sell. I understand that some people may not share the same view. So I kindly request that you share your views instead of criticizing my post without any explanation.

Thank you!","Not all countries are China, see Italy and US. It’s very unclear what happens when countries basically give up on containment and move to just slow the disease.Economic impact will likely be greater then a few airlines and hotels as many companies in entertainment, food service, tourism and professional services don’t have capacity to weather loss of 1/4 or more of annual revenue will go bankrupt.Recession will generate a host of issues all by itself, layoffs, declining housing values and lack of demand for luxury items.You are also assuming the recent record highs were rational and warranted, which may be true, but I’d argue is not a given.Yes over the long haul buying the stock of a rock solid company at any level below a record high will likely be a good move but why do that move when you know markets always overreact? Worst case scenario this isn’t a minor demand issue this is a tidal wave of a demand issue. Consider rolling waves of several week long nation wide quarantine repeating itself over and over for a year until a vaccine is finally available.

Thank you!","Very thoughtful and insightful post. I wish that more people could write post like this.I agree. But my point is that China has proven that the coronavirus is a fixable problem. I would say at this point, Covid-19 is not a black box and if the worse indeed happens, we already know the solution to solving this problem. Unlike probably a month ago where everybody was trying to figure out something, we could be reasonably optimistic that the problem is fixable. So, one should not have that much fear.Totally agree. That's why as an investor, one should avoid these companies unless one is sure that they have ample cash to withstand this temporary downturn. In other words, avoid companies with a lot of debt.AgreeAgreeMy advice is this. Let's say somebody has an extra cash of $10,000 or $100,000 or whatever. Let's say over the course of the year, there is indeed volatility. One should not panic but instead buy these great companies every time when there is a dip and avoid buying it on days like Friday when it's up significantly. Don't you agree that this buying method will very likely make money in the long term, perhaps in 2 years time? My argument is that since there is so much volatility that we have not seen in a long while, a rational investor can keep buy these great companies, assuming the volatility stays, at prices that are irrational on certain days.I'd like to add that the future is never certain and if it was, there is no need for people to invest. Furthermore, when the future is clear and bright, you would be looking at totally different valuations. I think the traditional saying is that one should be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when everybody is greedy and also the best time to buy is when there is blood on the streets. I am saying that perhaps now is there is blood on the streets and hence is right time to initiate a position in all these great companies at a decent valuation because the market is indiscriminately selling all companies on certain days. However, one has to buy them consistently, especially on days like Thursday.",1,0.528,0.593,POSITIVE

But if we were to look at China, the cases have stopped increasing as quickly as they did in the past 1 month or so and life has largely continued as normal in China. For example, Apple has decided to close stores outside of greater China (https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/03/apples-covid-19-response/), which to me is a telling sign that China has done a good job in controlling the spread of the virus because otherwise they would be closing all stores worldwide.So my point is that the Covid-19 virus is largely a fixable problem and I believe the US government will ultimately take the right steps in controlling the virus. I am making this assumption because this year is an election year and while I do not favor one candidate over the other, the handling of the virus, which has a severe impact on the economy, will be major talking point of both candidates running for president. So the current administration will have a strong incentive to do the right thing.Hence, even though there are layoffs happening, I would think that once the coronavirus is gone, the consumers will be spending again and the economy will recover.Please let me know if you have an alternative viewpoint as I'd love to hear them.

So even if the US economy goes into a recession, and that's a big if, China will continue to buy Nike products and drink Starbucks coffee.
