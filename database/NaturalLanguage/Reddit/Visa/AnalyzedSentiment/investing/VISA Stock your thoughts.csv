,,"These threads are awful.Every fucking time. It's a post with nothing to it other than saying ""what are your thoughts on $xzy stock."" Nothing more. I always wonder how much actual investing decisions the people who make threads like this do based on the random comments on Reddit. I'm only being partially serious, but the amount of threads we get on here with posts like these almost make me think we have definitively hit a top.I mean, god forbid they actually have to do their own research on a stock or actually provide valuable information to a board. Heck, even just providing a nugget of context in the question would be helpful here.And for whatever it's worth, I have nothing against asking for advice or seeking some discussion. But just saying something like ""thoughts on $xyz"" is ridiculously lazy and just spams these boards.",0,0.527,1.0,NEGATIVE
