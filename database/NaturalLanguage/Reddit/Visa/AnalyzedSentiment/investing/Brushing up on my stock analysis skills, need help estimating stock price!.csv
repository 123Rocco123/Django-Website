,"As title says. I finished my Finance major last December but have fallen a little dull on analyzing and comparing firms. Right now i'm torn between Visa and Mastercard, so why not use this as an opportunity to compare the two? I decided to go with comparing ratios, percentages, and other important line numbers cause i can't be bothered with a full fundamental analysis and i like this way. Anyways, i'm down to estimating stock price, and i'm using the Dividend Discount method, however, i must be doing something wrong...let me walk you through what i've done... Step 1: I found the annual dividend history of Visa for the past 5 years. From 2013-2018, it is as follows: $0.35, $0.42, $0.50, $0.59, $0.69, $0.88. **Step 2: ** Since these are not constant growths, i brought them back to present value, using the rate of 10%. At first i used 7%, but the resulting growth average exceeded my expected return and would not work... $0.35, $0.35, $0.38, $0.40, $0.43, $0.50 Step 3: Now i estimate 2019's dividend. The original average dividend growth rate not brought back to PV is 20.44%. Given this, 2019 would be $1.06. At the PV growth rate, it should be $0.54...which one should i use in the final estimation? Step 4: I use CAPM formula to find the estimated rate of return right? The beta of Visa is 1.06, the risk free rate is used is 2.53%, I used a market return of 10%...CAPM i got was 10.45% Step 5: Estimate stock price...D/(r-g) should get me the estimated price. Using the dividend brought back to PV i did $0.54/(10.45%-9.5%)...$57.62...That'd mean Visa is way overpriced. Using the standard dividend estimate ($1.06/[10.45%-9.50%]) i got $112.27, still overpriced, but seems to be more realistic. Since i'm using 5 years of data, should i base the expected market return off the average S&P 500 returns of the past 5 years, or the standard 7 years? The average annual return of the past 5 years is 8.8% right? That number wont work in the end, so i used 10%. Be easy on me, ya boy rusty",Don't use the dividend discount model. There's no fundamental reason why it generates a reasonable valuation. Use DCF or valuation multiples.,0,0.516,0.998,NEGATIVE

Be easy on me, ya boy rusty","I totally forgot about DCF, but i'm pretty that would require me to forcast the IS and BS, both of which i can't be bothered to do since they'd probably take me days to do...I'm comparing valuation multiples and bottom lines, thought it'd be nice to throw in a little extra...DDM, DCF, APV, P/E Ratio method, and probably one more...The only one that doesn't require me to forcast statements is DDM",1,0.528,0.957,NEGATIVE
