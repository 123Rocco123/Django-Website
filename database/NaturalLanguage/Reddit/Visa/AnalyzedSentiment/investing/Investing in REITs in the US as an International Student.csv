,"Hello, Does anyone know whether it's legal or advisable to invest in REITs as an International Student (F1 visa)? I know that many international students invest in stocks in general, but haven't read or heard anything about them investing specifically in REITs. I'm aware that I will have to pay taxes and all that. I'm above 18 yrs old, and don't intend to invest in them at the frequency level of a day trader, more like just passively buying/selling here and there (maybe once or twice every couple of weeks). Thanks.","Thanks. I've always known it's possible, just unsure with REITs in particular",0,0.506,0.945,POSITIVE

It looks like it's allowed but you will have to report gain/loss to IRS and then pay taxes on gains.Think about if you can afford to lose money in the stock market as a student and specially as an international student.,0,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE
