,"What does it mean when there's a considerable divergence between the Average True Range and the RSI? For context, I'm talking about Visa specifically: I would've expected a much higher volatility due to the recent price increase, however the ATR is still really low while the RSI signals obviously overbought; see daily chart: https://ibb.co/JHZCkPW According to the Pivot Point Standard it has already broken 2 resistances (R1: 198.70 / R2: 206.67 / R3: 212.33), the next one being 217.98. Since it's an uptrend, should I take it as a signal that there is still room for Visa to grow? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Yours truly, a newbie","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

Yours truly, a newbie",Think about this way... a stock or etf will move up in an orderly manner and have low volatility when its trending so ATR will be decreasing. ATR increases during reversals or large volatility. So this stock or etf is moving up in an orderly manner and can stay overbought(rsi) as long as the moves are 1ATR or less (no crazy euphoria).,0,0.535,0.936,NEGATIVE
