If they’d done the same thing on a MasterCard or Visa they wouldn’t be getting interviewed at all and just told to accept they’ve learned a very cruel financial lesson the hard way.I understand not everyone has the best advantages in life and there’s a lot of ignorance around credit but credit card companies have been giving out predatory financing for decades without issue (I got my first credit card 18, I told them I had I had virtually no income and they had no problem giving me a 4 figure credit limit with a sky high interest rate)It’s ethically questionable but this is r/investing not ethics.

The reality is that this is a much worse world - a world where everyone pays much more for goods and services than they otherwise would, so companies like APT can pocket a massive, parasitical middleman fee.... fast, secure, and affordable digital payments, as well as on-the-spot consumer credit, is already a solved problem. And now along comes APT, and wants to provide a similar solution at triple the cost. It doesn't make any economic sense. The reason there is so much confusion is that (1) from the consumer perspective, they falsely believe they are saving money (as the APT costs are hidden and incorporated into retailer prices); and (2) many merchants testify that they have benefited from APT, but as discussed, this was due to the early-adopter cannibalisation, and consumption pull-forward effects. What this means is there is an incredible lack of clear thinking and prevalent misinformation with respect to APT's business model and its likely ultimate effects.“",0,0.519,1.0,NEGATIVE

I can see the pull of it. I've had my eye on a $350 pair of sneakers - I've only ever in my life spent a third of that on a single pair of shoes, and it felt really extravagant - but I'll be damned if that ""pay $25/month for 18 months"" didn't have me briefly considering it. And it's not like I don't have $350 of disposable income anyways, this would not be a big deal for me if it weren't for ""but they're SHOES and we're in a pandemic and I'm not even GOING anywhere."" It's not the expense as much as it is the relative usefulness, you know? I of course didn't do it, because an 18 month payment plan on a pair of shoes is as bad as an 8 year note on a car, but I certainly see how people fall into that trap. It's specifically designed to allow people who don't have a ton of money to feel like they can afford a certain amount of luxury. And those of us who aren't young and broke certainly aren't immune. I take home in the comfortable six figures annually, but I was still like ""hmmm, maybe I can justify this extravagance."" I remember being young and broke and coming home from my barely minimum wage line cook job one day to see my roommate with a whole new Xbox 360 system and games financed with his Best Buy credit card, and I'll be damned if that credit card didn't get him into massive trouble. (No joke, I saw him buy a bunch of snacks there once the day before payday, because his checking account was in the red and the Best Buy credit line was the only liquidity he had available. Snacks from Best Buy were literally the only way he could eat that day.) You see a shiny toy and a bunch of cool games on the shelf for $500, no way - but you can certainly justify the minimum payment on that card of $30/month for all that fun, and you're not financially literate enough to calculate how long it'll take to pay off that $500 when you're just making minimum payments, and that you'll end up paying at least double that when it's all paid off.Anyways, sorry for the ramble.

,"I see these Buy Now Pay Later services absolutely everywhere now. Seems like it’s rarer to find an online store that doesn’t have one or more of these as a payment option. I’m sure they represent just a small percentage of total ecommerce transactions still, but given their growth it seems completely possible that they grow to a point where they are taking real share away from traditional credit and debit card purchases (since using BNPL totally bypasses these traditional payment rails), which impacts credit card issuers like Chase and Amex and also the card networks like Visa and Mastercard. It also impacts traditional card payment processors like a Stripe or Adyen. Point is I’ve up until recently just assumed that payment processors and Visa and Mastercard were untouchable winners in the continued shift to e-commerce but these new services have come out of nowhere and seem to be catching on really fast to their detriment.","Yeah haven’t really thought about valuation, but at $20B or whatever it’s tiny compared to any piece of the entrenched card industry eg credit card issuers, processors, networks...I mean Visa and MC have a combined like $800B valuation.If you believe that BNPL can be something like an Amex (basically both their own network and issuer) and this trend continues and becomes much more mainstream then the question is what value does BNPL have when people start saying “we accept Affirm/Afterpay first and cards second”",1,0.509,0.834,NEGATIVE

If Affirm is valued at 20B, you're saying that right now, Affirm is worth almost 5% of Visa. I don't think it's even close to that.Which isn't to be down on these companies. I think Affirm, Unity, Roblox, Airbnb, Wish, and on and on, are fantastic companies. but they're getting a massive inflation just because of industry, and it's unsustainable.I've said it before, and I know it's unpopular, but these past 2 years and projected next year are exactly, to a tee, what happened during the dot com bubble. I see a huge pop up ahead, and even if that doesn't happen since the Fed essentially made it illegal for the market to go down, it's Luckin Coffee level artificial inflation, and I'm not risking my retirement betting on a fake system staying as such.But Affirm as a company is going to do good things, and I'll be excited to watch their growth.

If that happens then what is the appropriate valuation for either this whole category or for any of these cos?",3,0.527,0.999,NEGATIVE

Essentially that’s what credit cards already are: you swipe a piece of plastic (or touch it to a reader) and don’t pay until the end of the month. Many cards have 0% interest for a certain amount of time.The only difference I see is it’s flexible financing offered through a 3rd party at checkout. I don’t see a big enough difference to matter much to the consumer. Even if I’m seriously out of touch on this, if the service is popular enough Visa / Amex / etc will just offer their own service. Heck, they could even tie it to your current credit card account, so you can choose to finance that purchase separately from your normal account and maybe give the flexibility of transferring the BNPL payments to your regular credit balance.Then again, I thought Twitter was dumb and would never really be more than a passing fad.",0,0.513,1.0,NEGATIVE

The way you describe it is exactly how it works - it’s set aside in a separate “account” that doesn’t gain interest like your normal balance would, and that Pay Over Time account has a set limit, as well. It’s all folded into your credit card account so when I say “Pay Over Time account,” I’m referring to a virtual account within your existing account.",1,0.511,1.0,NEGATIVE

The point is they want extra time to pay without revolving a balance and paying 18% interest or whatever.And credit cards already let you split a purchases and pay over time.So there are other reasons why people are using these services above and beyond what you’ve mentioned.,1,0.518,0.998,NEGATIVE

They charge e-commerce companies for *borrowing money* for their customers. It's a win-win strategy: Klarna gets its fees, customers save money because they don't have to spend them immediately, shops receive more sales. A lot of projects are reimagining loans atm, and Klarna is just one of them. So no, Klarna won't replace credit services alone, but together with other platforms.There should be a name for this market, does anyone know it?",0,0.551,0.996,POSITIVE

They do run a credit check on you and start you off with a small credit limit but it works out really well if you only stick to certain things you could afford to buy outright. After 6 months they gave me an automatic £120 credit increase on top of my original credit limit and added the boost option for me. I always try to either pay it off early or meticulously keep track of my payments using an online payment diary that sends me emails whenever I need to pay. I think if you are disciplined it can be a very very good tool.,0,0.521,0.995,POSITIVE
