,"I've got nothing against the biggest components of the S&P 500 (http://siblisresearch.com/data/weights-sp-500-companies/), in fact I own several of them individually. I just want to buy a fund whose performance isn't so easily swayed (because the funds are weighted) by just a few of companies. I want to truly invest in the whole US market but not have a few massive companies really determine the fund (just one company like Apple having a bad quarter can tank a typical S&P 500 fund). Also, I want to diversify, and I'm already heavily invested with individual stocks in most of those top ten companies. Is there such a fund out there - like VOO or VTI but MINUS some or all of the top ten: Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Berkshire, Exxon, Google, Johnson & Johnson, Chase, Visa? *EDIT: Looks like I should look into equal weighted funds like RSP or EUSA. Why are these not more popular? Apple has an iPhone that's not that interesting, Facebook or Google get hit with privacy or antitrust lawsuits, oil drops and Exxon profits go down, and suddenly the vaunted ""buy the market"" strategy totally tanks because of just a few companies. Doesn't seem like a true representation of how the US economy is going (which market-buying is all about).",There's the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP). Each of the 500 companies is supposed to have an equal weighting of 0.2%. The fund and the index are rebalanced quarterly.,0,0.514,1.0,NEGATIVE

But the expense ratio is also 0.2%. I noticed someone else mentioned EUSA. At least the fee is a bit lower at 0.15%. The fees are higher because they have to rebalance quarterly.They're not popular right now because we're in a bull market.

Certainly the fund is going to have higher turnover and trading costs. In addition, it's AUM is probably much smaller than a typical market cap weight SP500 fund.

Thank you!RVRS - that's an interesting fund, though not for me. I guess the idea is that you want to invest in small cap, but also have a little bit of mid and large cap there too?
