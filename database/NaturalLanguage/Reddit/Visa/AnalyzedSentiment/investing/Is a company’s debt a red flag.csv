,"So my question is, should debt turn me away from a companies stock? I’ve read that some debt can be good debt, but how much Is a healthy amount of debt? I’m looking at Mastercard(MA). And over all I’m pretty happy with the stock, but the amount of debt they have is making me cautious. I’ve done reading and people seem to think pretty positively of Mastercard(& Visa). Why are people not turned off by the amount of debt that this company holds?","It depends on what it’s for and if the company can repay it. If I told you a person had $500k of credit card debt, you’d be horrified. But if it were a $500k mortgage, that’s much more palatable",0,0.545,1.0,NEGATIVE

Why are people not turned off by the amount of debt that this company holds?",It depends. If they are able to leverage other people's money (debt) and get a higher return off it then it's good. If they do the opposite that's the road to bankruptcy.If they took on debt in the past at a low rate and now have to renew at a high rate that could be a problem.MA is kind of neutral here. I think people thought the recession won't happen so there in no current concern.,0,0.519,1.0,NEGATIVE

Level of debt load can vary by sector, and companies usually prefer some amount of debt because debt repayments are tax protected.",0,0.512,0.938,NEGATIVE

Why are people not turned off by the amount of debt that this company holds?","It could be. In the case of Mastercard, the debt-to-equity ratio is around 2, which is pretty high, but Mastercard has very high cashflow. For the $14B in long-term debt, at the same time it rakes in around $10B annually in operating cash flow. In this case, I'm not concerned.",0,0.545,0.981,NEGATIVE

Why are people not turned off by the amount of debt that this company holds?",It depends on their ability to afford that debt and being able to pay it off.

Why are people not turned off by the amount of debt that this company holds?",Because their interest and capital expenditure is a mere fraction of their income. It is reasonable to assume this will continue for some time. They also don't have that much debt and this grew most rapidly when rates bottomed. These guys know what they're doing.,0,0.541,0.982,POSITIVE

Why are people not turned off by the amount of debt that this company holds?","You’ve got to look at interest coverage (What % of pre-interest cashflows go towards debt service) and other measures like debt outstanding as a % of EBITDA (How long would it take them to repay all the debt if they diverted all profits towards debt payoffs) to gauge how risky it is. You also need to look at the maturities of the debt to see how much liquidity matters in the near term if capital markets get dicey.In the case of Mastercard, they have super strong cashflows that easily services the debt, so it is a non-issue, unless you think the business profits will materially degrade.",0,0.531,0.937,NEGATIVE
