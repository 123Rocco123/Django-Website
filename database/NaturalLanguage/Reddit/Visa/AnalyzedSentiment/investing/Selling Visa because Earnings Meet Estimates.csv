But what am I missing?,Europeans are too austerity to use credit card.Uhm in some EU nations paying with cash is already the outlier. It varies heavily between nations with Germany probably being the most pro-cash. Mainly because people there put high value of privacy and dont want the government to be able to track their purchases and have a literal movement profile of them. Of course thats largely a generational thing since young people all have smart-phones anyways and such privacy isnt possible to begin with.,2,0.508,0.982,NEGATIVE
