,"Hi Guys, Quick Background; I am an independent contractor so I have my retirement with Wealthfront as a SEP IRA (for now). I am not dissolving this so lets avoid that feedback. This is also which I invest most of my money. I opened a Roth IRA a few years ago by accident (meant to open the SEP) But for now its fine. I am trying to see what I should do Sith my current ROTH holdings and I have about $2500 in cash in the ROTH account. I know a lot of people suggest, VOO, VIG, VYM and VNQ but this is my dilemma as there is a lot of overlap between the suggested ETF I just mentioned and what is in my SEP IRA and ROTH. anyone have any suggestions of some ETF that I my ROTH should focus on assume I do keep this for a long time. Ideally id love to max out yearly one account then add funds to another. As of right now though, im not adding any funds into the ROTH. Voo – Microsoft, amazon ,apple, FB VIG – ALREADY OWN VYM - Likely will Buy VNQ – IN WEALTHFRONT WealthFront Account VTI – Micro, amazon, apple, alphabet ITOT – Micro, amaxon, FB, apple SCHB – Micro, amazon, FB, apple SCHF – Nestle, NOrvatis, Roche VEA VWO Schwab ROTH account Currently VIG – Micro, Visa, proctor, Walmart VNQ – Real Estate SCHX – Micro, apple, amazon, FB (thinking about selling since so many Microsoft holdings) SCHF - Nestle, Norvatis, Roche, Samsun FHLC Healthcare CIBR -","Overlap is fine if you are doing broad index based funds like VTI or ITOT. You also only need one per category. No need to have ITOT and VTI and SCHB. Edit: Can probably drop VOO in this as well.Why are you holding Vanguard and Fidelity funds in a Schwab account? You're almost certainly wasting money doing that.Edit: And for the Roth IRA, look into the mutual funds: SWTSX, SWISX and SWAGX.Edit: You may want to read up on the 3 fund portfolio: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio",0,0.517,1.0,NEGATIVE

VTI, and SCHB are held in the Wealthfront portfolio so I cannot change that. I plan to down the road remove my funds and manage myself, but I want to hit a certain $ before I do that.When I opened the ROTH I didnt know what I was really doing and searched like Top healthcare ETF and Fidelity likely showed up. Same with the vanguard.I did see that Vanguard has ""retirement funds"" where I can just throw money into one of those...may look for whatever the equivalent of that is for Schwab. I did review that link you sent, but again Micro, amazon FB etc keep being the top 3 and I feel I should at least diversify a tad?",1,0.513,1.0,NEGATIVE
