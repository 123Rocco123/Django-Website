,"So I just start investing a month or so ago, I‚Äôm 18 and am investing roughly 50% of what I make at my part time job into stocks that pay dividends in hopes to have passive income at an early retirement age. I own shares of a couple of dividend ETFs, companies like Coca Cola and AbbV and Visa, and a few other things. I currently have minimal stock in Kimco and Arbor Realty as I was recommended those for real estate. My goal was to grow those two until I had money to get into real estate myself. However, knowing very little about real estate, I figured it may be a better idea to look into an ETF. I‚Äôm between the two listed in the title, but wasn‚Äôt sure if the dividends would be worth it or if they would snowball enough over the next 20-25 years to make it worth the investment. Does anyone have a preference between the two that I mentioned, or should I leave real estate out of my stock portfolio? If it‚Äôs worth anything, my largest share of my portfolio is Schwab‚Äôs ETF, and didn‚Äôt know if using Vanguard would be safer to avoid having all of my ETF‚Äôs be Schwab. Any advice at all is appreciated. Thank you Reddit brokers üôè","Considering your age, I would forget about REIT's for now. While it is nice to look at the dividends at the end of the month or quarter, you are giving up on growth stocks. The other thing is that you will pay taxes on dividends which impacts the profit during tax time. So I would recommend sticking with a large ETF like VTI or SCHB and you'll still get a dividend but presumably lower tax than a REIT. Both are basically SPY trackers and should be fairly safe and maximize the growth of your money.As far as Vanguard vs Schwab, meh. They are fairly similar with a slight nod to Schwab for self directed investors and a few more bells and whistles with the Vanguard for more of a buy and hold simple investor easiness. However, do what you want with the money, 18 is fabulously young to invest and you can shape a strategy for yourself.",0,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE

REITs a bit more like value investing returns. But to show you my suggestion to not worry about REIT or dividend investing and go into something like VOO https://portfolioslab.com/tools/stock-comparison/SCHD/VOO. You'll get a better return on your money in the long run. I would only do a REIT if you have a tax leveraged account or are older and are looking to preserve capital.",2,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE

Any advice at all is appreciated. Thank you Reddit brokers üôè","Kimco and Arbor are fairly fine REITs in their respective sub-industry lines, but be advised that they are very focused on very specific areas as far as REITs go.That means there is a meaningful chance the RE sector may be up in any given year while you may be losing money.If you dont know much about RE, and dont have the time to spend to learn, I would stay away from mREITs all together and invest in VNQ and/or XLRE. I dont know much about SCHH, but its returns dont seem very appealing over the last 5 to 8 years compared to the other two.You can certainly accumulate S&P 500 beating gains in RE, and it's an excellent area for income focused investors, but it's fairly complex and there are tons of players.I would focus on accumulating as much SPY, or similar ETFs, as possible for now. Once you hit something like 100K or more, then you can start thinking about focusing on specific sectors and maybe income generation.The fact of the matter is, if you are not investing in a tax advantaged account, you want your investments to be in high growth stocks that pay little to no dividend and instead invest that money in themselves for excellent returns or do buybacks. Dividends eat into your compounding. So no reason to take a hit to your compounding while you are still accumulating wealth.",0,0.522,0.713,NEGATIVE
