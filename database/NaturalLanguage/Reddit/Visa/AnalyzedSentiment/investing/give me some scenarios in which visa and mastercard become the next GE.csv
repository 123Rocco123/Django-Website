,,"Sorta different though because these are both credit card services, meaning there’s some aspect of money being extended on credit in your name for the period (one month in most cases) which you pay back. Although I see what you’re saying if the banks set up “credit accounts” and cut out the middle man servicer.",1,0.525,0.665,NEGATIVE
