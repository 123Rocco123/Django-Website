,"I picked up about 5,000 dollars worth of shares at around 70 a share a few years back and have been holding ever since. I usually don't hold too many stocks, just ETFs, but I decided to hold onto this one and its had some nice gains. I picked it up as pure speculation and luck, no actual research. The one aspect I liked about AXP is the incredible brand loyalty and their relationship with businesses. Does anyone view american express as a long term buy? I'm debating whether I should take my profits now. I only own a few other stocks, Visa, MA, amazon and microsoft which I'm not selling and holding for long term. American express is the only one i'm having doubts about long term.","If you bought at $70 and it's at ~$116 now, if you're feeling iffy about it or unsure, just put a stop loss at $105 to secure a 50% gain minimum, especially since you're so positive you never plan on selling the others.This way, if it keeps going up, your stop loss won't be met and your shares will keep gaining value. And if you are forced to sell it, well, it's still a 50% gain. And not only that, but you can keep increasing your stop loss accordingly as the price increases, thus locking in higher gains.I know you're really looking for somebody to come in and give their opinion on AXP itself, but I hope my advice was still helpful.",0,0.522,0.711,POSITIVE
