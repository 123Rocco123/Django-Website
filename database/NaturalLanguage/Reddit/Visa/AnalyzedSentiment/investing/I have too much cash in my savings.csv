,"So I feel I’m in an odd situation but probably common for people who browse this subreddit. I’m 26, I have roughly 70k cash. Breakdown 4K in the market(few etfs then stocks such as Visa, Microsoft, United health, intel), 11k roughly within my brokerage account that I’m not doing anything with. Student loan debt: 18k 4 percent interest, car loan with 4.5k left 4 percent interest I had way more in the market a year ago, about 15k, but I was new to investing and I got scared and pulled out. Dumb move, I’m aware. The rest is in a money market savings where I’m getting almost a 2 percent return. I am aware that time in the market > timing. I also feel that I’m currently being way too passive and have missed out on great returns these past few months. At this point I am trying to figure out what to do. What I’m thinking is the following. I don’t think just doing a big buy of let’s say 20k is the right call. If the market was in a decline, I would be more aggressive and buying heavily over that period of time. But right now doing something like that to me seems at least in the short term I’d lose hard. I do think though that I should be buying. How much though I am unsure. I’m aware that we truly don’t know where the market is going. But I feel I should be maybe putting half of what I save per month into the market. Probably more given my savings already. So if I save 2k in a month, 1k savings, 1k market. I know I’ll save roughly 20k from my job this year. So having 4K out of 85-90k In stocks/etfs is silly and not a smart choice.

If you were in my shoes, what would you do?","A Roth IRA is a good place to have your emergency fund.https://www.morningstar.com/videos/915162/investing-insights-fund-upgrades-roth-iras-and-all.htmlI often recommend a Roth IRA because you have so much flexibility in terms of those withdrawals. So, you can withdraw your contributions at any time and for any reason without any taxes or penalties. That's one reason why I recommend a Roth IRA as a good emergency fund vehicle. Even if you have the best of intentions and you plan to leave in the money in there until your retirement, you can save within the confines of a Roth IRA, presumably in something a little bit safer, and build up critical mass in safe assets before you start saving in long-term assets.The stock market is a bad place for an emergency fund. But that doesn't rule out an IRA. For instance, you could open a Roth IRA at Ally and get 2.2% in a Roth IRA savings account.https://www.ally.com/bank/ira/ira-account/You could get a slightly better (not FDIC insured rate) by opening an account at Vanguard and just leaving it in the settlement fund. The advantage with Ally is that you can instantly transfer money from the Roth account to a checking account - giving you access to the money via ATM or check as quickly as you can navigate their site. (Check with a customer service rep about this - I don't have an IRA account there, but that's my experience with other accounts.)Since you can only put $6k/year into a Roth IRA, you will at least start out with some emergency fund that's not in the Roth IRA which will allow you to treat the Roth as a ""really bad emergency"" fund. In that case, you can consider putting it into a Roth CD that will get higher rates.You can get to the money in most CD's before they mature, but you typically have to take all the money out of the CD and you will pay an early withdrawal penalty. If the rate is the same between all balance tiers, consider taking out multiple smaller CDs which you can break one at a time. Look into CD ladders.To understand early withdrawal penalties, seehttps://www.depositaccounts.com/tools/break-cd-calculator.aspxAs time passes, you may decide that you have enough savings outside of the Roth savings or CDs to withstand emergencies. That's a good time to shift your Roth from emergency mode to investment mode - roll over the money to a Roth brokerage account and put it into the market. Be careful with this transaction - get help from the brokerage company to be sure you do it right else it can turn into not-a-roth-account and a tax penalty. If you reach this point in 5 years, that means you could have over $30k to invest and grow tax free over your lifetime. If you never touch it (add or withdrawal) and make 7% per year in the market (reasonable average for S&P 500 or total market) that $30k will be $392k when you are 70.",1,0.526,0.987,NEGATIVE

If you were in my shoes, what would you do?","IMO - as others have said - pay off the debt ASAP. You have the cash available. Sure you could make more in the market, but you also may not. Paying off debt is a guaranteed return, and it's not scary.That would leave you 48k in cash, which is not a bad number for an emergency fund, maybe a bit higher than you want right now. You could trim about 12-24k off that for investing, still leaving 24-36k for an ER fund.BTW Vanguard MM is doing 2.37% right now, so you should definitely be doing better than 2%. Look around.As for the investing part, yes definitely. Just keep making steady investments on a regular basis, e.g. monthly or quarterly, on stocks, funds or other investments you've researched. Use some of that cash reserve, some of your new money, and make sure to diversify so all your eggs aren't in one basket.No reason to drop 20k all at once - 28% of your cash - as if you were in a casino putting it all on black. That's a recipe to get scared and pull out if things don't go so well. I like DCA (dollar cost averaging) instead of investing in a lump sum. Slow but steady, it's not a race.

If you were in my shoes, what would you do?",I think that the following would be a good solution for your “too much cash” problem.The first step is probably the hardest and it would be to pay off the debt. It would be hard for anyone to see nearly $23k be deducted from their account without immediately receiving something for the transaction but in your situation you already have the goods! Your education and a vehicle.Next on the list would be to create an emergency fund for your self. Something that is equal to 3-6 months of your monthly expenses in the unfortunate case that a major event occurs in your life that can put your financial stability at risk.The third step would be to make a contribution in full to either a Traditional or Roth IRA. Most likely investing this money in a Target Date / Retirement fund would perfectly fit your situation.I think the last step is to then sit down with someone who can help you gain a concrete understanding of the goals that you wish to achieve by investing in your brokerage account. It may be helpful for you to assess why you have chosen your current investments in order to understand how they are helping you achieve your goals.EDIT: I should have asked this question.
