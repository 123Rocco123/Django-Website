,"The treasury direct website (https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_ibuy.htm) mentions that you need to be either a citizen, resident or civilian employee.

Does resident here mean tax resident or permanent resident (like a GC holder)?","I saw this last night and was hoping someone more qualified would answer, but that hasn't happened yet so I suppose I'll do my best to answer here.The site you linked says (under ""Who may own an I bond?""):Yes, if you have a Social Security Number and meet any one of these three conditions:United States citizen, whether you live in the U.S. or abroadUnited States residentCivilian employee of the United States, no matter where you liveSo you clearly need an SSN. I am pretty sure the only way that can happen is if you are a citizen or hold a green card. If there's any other situation that would give you a SSN then that should also work.If you are a non-citizen it seems like the requirement is that you have to currently live in the US or be employed by the US government. If you are employed by the US government, then you can buy them no matter where you live (presumably since you might be stationed over-seas as part of your job).",0,0.519,1.0,NEGATIVE
