,"This post is less asking for advice, more so wanting to hear what people think about having strong conviction of certain companies, and putting plenty of eggs in one basket. Really just looking for discussion, and sharing what’s going on with my portfolio. So, I’m young, 23 years old. I have a well paying job and I have been investing since I was 19. My money kind of looks like this right now- Roth IRA- $27k spread into ETFs because I don’t want to risk my lump-sum retirement payment. Individual brokerage- $15k in JEPI, basically where I park some cash that I don’t want to spend on stocks if I find nothing attractive to purchase. $87k across 8 stocks, roughly the same position size, give or take a couple thousand. I own FICO, Mastercard, Visa, S&P Global, Google, Texas Roadhouse, Markel Corp, and VICI. All these positions are in the green. So I’m highly concentrated in this portfolio, I believe what I own, I strongly believe they will continue to do well. Concentrating my positions has led to outsized returns… and truthfully I wouldn’t say I took much extra risk by owning so few stocks. Now the point of this post boils down to this: I would like to concentrate even more deeply into FICO, VISA, and S&P Global because I think they are practically indestructible businesses. I’m willing to sell my TXRH and JEPI and split that ~$22k between the three. That would bring the allocation percentage of those three positions to approximately 17%, 19%, and 16%, respectively. (if you include my Mastercard position with visa, that number is actually up to 26%) I have been invested in these companies for a while and have been following the earnings reports for a couple years. These companies continue to absolutely kill it. This post is seeing if anyone has dealt with the same feelings regarding having a concentrated portfolio, because making these big, highly calculated decisions has served me well so far. But I don’t know if I’m setting myself up for a catastrophe. Thanks","its great until it isnt , think Nokia and IBM.have at least 50% in something broader like S&P500 , this will give you about 508 companies. Obviously not spread evenly, but a lot more safer.",0,0.522,0.995,NEGATIVE

Some of the most successful value investors of all time also take the same approach.To everyone who says you should invest in an index fund such as QQQ, the truth is that they're in no different position than you when around 80% of their returns are derived from 7 companies. They just have a false sense of security based on illusory diversification.From reading your description, it sounds like you actually know what you're talking about. (I may be biased because I take a similar approach and because I'm also bullish on some of your holdings). If you were betting it all on meme stocks or some random biotech startup, I'd say you're unlikely to be successful. That's not the case here.At the end of the day, if you're beating the market, you know the companies, their businesses and their industries well enough and you also have strong convictions in all of your holdings based on solid fundamentals, don't fix it if it's not broken. You're well ahead of anyone I've ever met at your age and you've got plenty of runway to change course if needed.",0,0.539,0.995,NEGATIVE

You are correct, the fate of any company, country, empire, or person is the same.So a good lens to view this through, is what companies are still on the way up? Which are on the way down? Which are in their infancy, that may prove themselves in the market before a meteoric rise? Which companies have had their space infiltrated? What is the success of that infiltration?PayPal is a good example. Their space has been so deeply infiltrated that I don’t think they’ll ever see their heyday again. Venmo is great, but that’s not taking them to a beautiful stretch of incredible, uncontested compounding.Automotive, consumer defensive, and airliners are good examples. It’s a race to the bottom, slim margins and not a lot of room for real innovation. I don’t want to own any of them, but with indexing; I am forced to.So look for companies that are deeply entrenched in the fabric of society, that have little to no competition, and have extremely deep and wide moats. These companies, like FICO and VISA + MA, are the ticket to incredible returns. Just carefully monitor them, and read news about competitors every now and then. It doesn’t take much effort to know what competitors are on the horizon, and then tracking those major competitors.There are other businesses out there that will never tell you how incredible their monopolies are, so you have to look around at the world, and if you look closely enough… they’ll be right in front of you all along.

That message stuck with me, as well as being willing to pay a premium (30-60) PE for truly special businesses.Sooooo….When I find a special business, buy it, read the earnings reports, and do nothing in the meantime. It’s truly a relieving feeling that I’ve owned visa for a little over two years now and I sincerely trust that business to protect my money.

More importantly, it's likely to hurt your saving rate.Buying individual stocks or sector funds creates unnecessary & uncompensated risk; I avoid doing so. Index funds are boring, but better for making money. If I wanted to talk about my interesting investments at parties or wanted a new hobby, I might invest 5-10% of my portfolio in individual stocks. As it is, I own pretty much every publicly-traded company in the world; that's interesting enough for me.All of the individual stocks & sector funds are being followed by thousands or millions of other investors. Current prices reflect their collective knowledge of future expectations for each one. I'm a member of the Triple Nine Society, but I'm not smarter than all of them. If I found a stock or sector that looked like a bargain, the most likely explanation would be that the others know something I don't.You have more important things to do with your time. Your savings rate is probably far more important to building your wealth for the next decade or two than your rate of return. Stock picking is unlikely to help your rate of return, but it's almost certain to distract you from doing things that can help you increase your savings rate.

And truthfully, most people have absolutely no clue what they’re buying in the market. My parents, my parents financial advisor, some friends people I work with (who make great money) all pitch me dogshit nobody-stocks and dogshit market forecasts, buying dogshit companies that are literally burning money everyday, pre-revenue companies, people selling everything at the beginning of the year thinking a crash was coming and missing this whole year of gains.This stupid shit behavior knows no bounds, no matter how educated you are, what titles or certifications you have, money manager, CFA… nothing stops you from being an emotional dumbass that will buy dogshit thinking it’ll make you rich.It takes about 3 minutes to skim over a stocks financial history.90% of the time you’ll say “no” immediately.5% you’ll look further into and say no3% you’ll buy after carefully reading on them, and they’ll underperform2% will be real winners and mooorrrreee than make up for any losses or underperformance in the 3%.I abide by simple rules:Don’t buy dogshit.Buy good shit.Pay a decent price for said “good shit”Follow the companies business performance.Do nothing else in the meantime.",1,0.545,1.0,NEGATIVE

If you can handle it and understand what you own then go for it. If you feel like you'll start bailing during a drawdown you could end up hurting your portfolio. Most importantly you should assess that if your portfolio hits a prolonged drawdown for say 3 years and even if you don't sell your positions will you financially be okay ie. Not be a forced seller? Also, expect to hit market cycles where these stocks will underperform, that's just the nature of the stock market.Concentrating positions is like leverage, it's not necessary good or bad and most active performers beat the market by running high conviction concentrated positions but it also amplifies the downside. A good real life example of this is to study the history of Sequoia Fund that is currently going through a prolonged rough patch that uses a similar strategy.

My money kind of looks like this right now- Roth IRA- $27k spread into ETFs because I don’t want to risk my lump-sum retirement payment. Individual brokerage- $15k in JEPI, basically where I park some cash that I don’t want to spend on stocks if I find nothing attractive to purchase. $87k across 8 stocks, roughly the same position size, give or take a couple thousand. I own FICO, Mastercard, Visa, S&P Global, Google, Texas Roadhouse, Markel Corp, and VICI. All these positions are in the green. So I’m highly concentrated in this portfolio, I believe what I own, I strongly believe they will continue to do well. Concentrating my positions has led to outsized returns… and truthfully I wouldn’t say I took much extra risk by owning so few stocks. Now the point of this post boils down to this: I would like to concentrate even more deeply into FICO, VISA, and S&P Global because I think they are practically indestructible businesses. I’m willing to sell my TXRH and JEPI and split that ~$22k between the three. That would bring the allocation percentage of those three positions to approximately 17%, 19%, and 16%, respectively. (if you include my Mastercard position with visa, that number is actually up to 26%) I have been invested in these companies for a while and have been following the earnings reports for a couple years. These companies continue to absolutely kill it. This post is seeing if anyone has dealt with the same feelings regarding having a concentrated portfolio, because making these big, highly calculated decisions has served me well so far. But I don’t know if I’m setting myself up for a catastrophe. Thanks",Has this beaten the 500 or QQQ? That is my gauge. I do own some individual stocks…but not many.,0,0.507,0.994,POSITIVE

Hard to know for sure, as I add money to the account, my total percentage return gets diluted.I usually benchmark it against my Roth IRA because I usually put only a couple ETFs there, and that percent return gets diluted once a year as well.Im at 8% return on my Roth vs 13% in my individual brokerage. So, so far it’s working, but a couple years is not really enough time to tell.",1,0.537,1.0,NEGATIVE

Then I went down to 100% TSLA in 2018-2019 and suddenly I'm a multimillionaire. I sold a good bit to buy some houses and started an Airbnb business, but I still have millions on TSLA.Yes I got quite lucky and there's a lot of stories like mine.

Congrats, truthfully I’m not pursuing a story like yours, but that mindset of knowing what you’re buying (if you can afford to take the risk), and going deep can be life changing, as it was for you.Edit, it’s funny because I had some serious conviction on Crocs footwear. Incredible brand in my opinion. Really good financials. At the time, I was head over heels for this stock and put like 3k into it. It was the first stock I had made over 100% return on. I was in a bunch of “value stocks” at the time, but yeah. I found a good company, went in… and boom, huge gain. Coulda shoulda woulda, but I’m feeling the same things now for the companies I own and why let. 1-2% of your portfolio sit in such incredible businesses?",1,0.538,1.0,POSITIVE
