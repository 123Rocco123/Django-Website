Mastercard was collectively owned by its member banks until it became a public, standalone company in 2006. From 2006 through 2018, it grew revenue 13% compounded annually and free cash flow per share 27% compounded annually as operating margin expanded from 20% to more than 56%. Akre Focus Fund Investment: Our investment in Mastercard began in February 2010 under the cloud of uncertainty presented by the Durbin Amendment (part of DoddFrank) and its potential impact on Mastercard’s debit business. Through appreciation and subsequent opportunistic purchases, as of June 30, 2020, Mastercard represented 10.6% of the portfolio.Investment Thesis: Approximately 85% of the world’s purchase transactions today are done using cash and checks. This presents an enormous market opportunity for Mastercard - perhaps the largest imaginable if one thinks of Gross Domestic Product as the summation of all the purchase transactions in an economy. In Mastercard, we believe we own a business with increasing odds of profiting from the growth and secular movement of those purchase transactions to electronic means of payment, earning a small piece on the trillions of dollars transacted over its network. This ongoing shift continued to be aided by the growth of e-commerce, new acceptance locations/categories (mass transit, B2B and P2P payments), the increasing inclusion via prepaid cards of 2.5 billion unbanked consumers worldwide, mobile commerce (given the lack of wireline infrastructure in many countries), and the government moving payment disbursement programs (e.g. Social Security, Veterans benefits) from paper checks to electronic payments. Furthermore, Mastercard has no net debt, a 40% free cash flow margin, pricing power, and is able to repurchase billions of dollars annually of its stock while reinvesting in what it calls “the war on cash.”Page 15:https://www.akrefund.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Akre-Focus-Fund-Pitchbook-2020-Q2.pdfMCO & AMT aren't bad companies either ;)",0,0.543,0.511,POSITIVE

It could continue to do very well but is out of my risk tolerance (valuation and still too early, they will need to challenge bigger players to penetrate the larger market) I’m less concerned about pypl’s valuation because they already have broken into the mainstream market especially government issued payments. In general regarding valuation in this space they are all going to be higher current valuations because they are al high quality businesses with high expected growth rates I believe you have to analyze the potential addressable market and probability they can enter and take market share that you can come up with your own estimation of fwd P/E say 3-5 years out or else you will always look at the next year fwd PE and say it’s too high...So the way I see it-pypl is the high growth play -v and ma are the established mature companies in this space that can still do double digits -fiserv is the value play -square has been on a tear and is in more speculative territory",2,0.543,0.998,NEGATIVE

Europe creating their own payment network infrastructure is a solid idea for them, but Europe has a history of poor execution regarding banks of different countries cooperating and it will likely be a headache, and it’s not slated to be used until 2022 so it’s pretty far off for Visa and MasterCard to accelerate growth elsewhere, such as emerging markets, more attractive B2B payment networks, and a play at decentralized currency (visa has some promising patents). Their margins are ridiculous (50%) so they have great FCF that can be used to continually grow their dividend and buy back stock, something that Visa does a lot of.",0,0.534,1.0,NEGATIVE
