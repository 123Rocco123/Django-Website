,"I haven't invested since August, and their haven't been any dips in the market since early November. Even then, it was a small dip and the market shot up 800 points or so for the next few days. The market also seems to not be making any sense because every time the unemployment numbers are increasing the market shoots up. It's mainly due to injections of liquidity from the fed reserve. But, at some point the house of cards has to fall. A lot of these companies that are going up are IPOs that solely went up because of niche markets that would not have been as big if the coronavirus had not have happened ex: peloton, zoom, some cloud stocks etc. Now it's hard to even find a stock under $100 because the whole market has been overflooded with newby investors, liquidity, and activist hedge funds that are trying to keep retail and manufacturing relevant that is keeping the blue chip stocks propped up as well. With that said, at these prices is it still worth it to buy a couple shares of these overvalued firms like Zoom, Netflix, Amazon, Peloton, Tesla etc. Look for another IPO that may or may not go up? Draft Kings, Air bnb, Snowflake, beyond meat, rackspace, etc Or just wait it out logically like Buffett used to say in one of speeches be patient and only buy something if you know you can hold it for 10s. However, the more I feel I'm waiting the more I feel like I'm just letting my money sit doing nothing and I'm losing out on opportunity cost. These values just make no sense though, and every IPO that comes out sees even higher percentage gains than the one before it. The regular blue chip stocks that are steady like Microsoft, Visa, Proctor and Gamble, Walmart etc that seem like the best companies profit, revenue, and management wise don't rise up in value near as much as some poorly invested startup IPO in a niche market that has negative earnings every quarter. It just makes no sense. So, basically is it still worth it to invest in 2021, or should we all just sit out and wait for it to drop like how much higher can it go? And if so what makes for better investments in our current times blue chips that are less worrisome, tech companies, solar/renewables, or IPOs?","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

Index funds are in bubble territory. It's just Market which can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent due to endless money printing and pumping into assets. Also there's no hard and fast rules that backs the claim ""it won't wipe out last 50 years of gains"". Just because something never happened doesn't mean it won't happen in the future. Right now, majority of stocks are overvalued when compared to earnings. On top of that we have all sort of moon boys claiming various fundamentals to justify their overvalued MLM stocks. It's better to sit in on cash for 10 years than going for risk on mode. Value investing is all about finding mismatch of price and using it favor of an investor. How many stocks do you think you can find which is priced around PE of 10 as of now? None. A crash makes the life easier for picking stocks.Also if you don't know how much leverage is involved in this recent 2015 - 2021 index rally, you might not know enough to hold stacks in most companies.Strategies like DCA has its place but one should not DCA randomly. There should be specific pivot points to place orders and should have logical reason for that.March 2020 = stocks sell off because of a global pandemic.March 2021 = stocks sell off because the 10-year Treasury rose 0.20%.It's funny when price keeps going up in a bubble, even stupidest fundamentals are justified.",2,0.537,1.0,NEGATIVE

You bought 1000 each year for a $15,000 investment.You'd buy:105 shares in 199842 shares in 199918 shares in 200026 shares in 200155 shares in 2002That's $11,400 today. That doesn't even include dividends which would compound importantly. And, it pretty much the worse period. If you did the same thing but starting in 1997 and stopping one year earlier, it would be closer to $15,000.Keep in mind if something is at 100, goes down to 20, and then goes to 40 you'd actually make money if you bought equal amounts at both 100 and 20. For instance, if spent $1000 on 10 shares @100 and $1000 on 50 shares at @20 then when it is at 40 you'd have $2400.

Draft Kings, Air bnb, Snowflake, beyond meat, rackspace, etc Or just wait it out logically like Buffett used to say in one of speeches be patient and only buy something if you know you can hold it for 10s. However, the more I feel I'm waiting the more I feel like I'm just letting my money sit doing nothing and I'm losing out on opportunity cost. These values just make no sense though, and every IPO that comes out sees even higher percentage gains than the one before it. The regular blue chip stocks that are steady like Microsoft, Visa, Proctor and Gamble, Walmart etc that seem like the best companies profit, revenue, and management wise don't rise up in value near as much as some poorly invested startup IPO in a niche market that has negative earnings every quarter. It just makes no sense. So, basically is it still worth it to invest in 2021, or should we all just sit out and wait for it to drop like how much higher can it go? And if so what makes for better investments in our current times blue chips that are less worrisome, tech companies, solar/renewables, or IPOs?",Thanks for the thoughts!

The regular blue chip stocks that are steady like Microsoft, Visa, Proctor and Gamble, Walmart etc that seem like the best companies profit, revenue, and management wise don't rise up in value near as much as some poorly invested startup IPO in a niche market that has negative earnings every quarter. It just makes no sense. So, basically is it still worth it to invest in 2021, or should we all just sit out and wait for it to drop like how much higher can it go? And if so what makes for better investments in our current times blue chips that are less worrisome, tech companies, solar/renewables, or IPOs?","Invest in something undervalued. If people are upvoting it on this sub, it's most likely not. It feels much better seeing a stock you own go up 100% and feeling confident it will go up more, vs. knowing you're investing in a fomo stock that can fall to its real value at any moment.",0,0.543,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I haven't invested since August, and their haven't been any dips in the market since early November. Even then, it was a small dip and the market shot up 800 points or so for the next few days. The market also seems to not be making any sense because every time the unemployment numbers are increasing the market shoots up. It's mainly due to injections of liquidity from the fed reserve. But, at some point the house of cards has to fall. A lot of these companies that are going up are IPOs that solely went up because of niche markets that would not have been as big if the coronavirus had not have happened ex: peloton, zoom, some cloud stocks etc. Now it's hard to even find a stock under $100 because the whole market has been overflooded with newby investors, liquidity, and activist hedge funds that are trying to keep retail and manufacturing relevant that is keeping the blue chip stocks propped up as well. With that said, at these prices is it still worth it to buy a couple shares of these overvalued firms like Zoom, Netflix, Amazon, Peloton, Tesla etc. Look for another IPO that may or may not go up? Draft Kings, Air bnb, Snowflake, beyond meat, rackspace, etc Or just wait it out logically like Buffett used to say in one of speeches be patient and only buy something if you know you can hold it for 10s. However, the more I feel I'm waiting the more I feel like I'm just letting my money sit doing nothing and I'm losing out on opportunity cost. These values just make no sense though, and every IPO that comes out sees even higher percentage gains than the one before it.
