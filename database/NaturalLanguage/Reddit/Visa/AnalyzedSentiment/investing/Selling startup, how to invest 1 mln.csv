,"Hi everyone, Next month I’ll sell my share in a company/startup I was working on for the last 3 years. I’m 32, and the project didn’t become “next Facebook”, so I’ll cash out $1 mln next month and another $1 mln in the next 2 years. There’s also stock of the company who is buying us involved, but I guess it’s not relevant as I can’t sell it for another 2 years. The deal will happen because I’m burnt out and need some kind of a break, just have no more willpower to trying to grow to it. The question is - what is the best way to invest this $1 mln? This is not the money that will let me chill for the rest of my life (not that I want to), so how do I invest them smartly? I understand there are a lot of related questions, so: I have a 1 year old daughter Don’t have a proper house yet, not that I need it at the moment Living in Estonia, Tallinn atm, main dream is relocate to some place with nicer climate, but US doesn’t grant me a visa, and I’m not ready to retire to an island. The main goal is to invest this money and grow them x10 in the next 10-20 years. Greatly appreciate your advice!","If you find the investment that can bring a 26% return annually for the next 10 years (to 10x your money), will you let us know? Set realistic goals, even letting your money 10x in 20 years still requires an average return of 12% annually. The stock market isn't some get-rich-quick scheme, and your expectations are way too high.Next to that, don't take investment advice for 1-2 mil from strangers on the internet. Go talk to a professional.",0,0.541,1.0,NEGATIVE

I am setting realistic goals and obviously x10-20 is far fetched. My current investment is around avg 6% net return.

Greatly appreciate your advice!","Lets start with your point 4.-a) If you want to make 20 million from 2 in 10 years: Return Required ~18% a yearb) If you want to make 20 million, but now in 20 years: ~8.5% a year*Based on point 1. and 2. I would assume you dont want to lose it all trying to achieve 4.a) what is kinda out of marketNow, even for top-notch professionals, achieving 4.b) (8.5% a year for 20 years) is super hard, but here are some ideas:Since you are 32Y old, still working (generating extra income), you should be able & willing to take on more (relative) risky assets in your allocation for the next 20YLets simplify 1) with a ""100% - AGE/2"" Equity allocation ( with annual review), so that your current equity exposure would be: ~84% (rest is Fixed Income (Bonds))Before discussing allocation, when going for the long long term (20Y): LOW COST & LOW MANAGEMENT FEES.This means, build your own portfolio with ETF´s, low cost Mutual Funds (passive-ish) or directly going to the stocks.This also means: pay attention the TAX STRUCTURE of your available vehicles (are they taxable? what about the tax exempt ones? Long term capital gains vs short term capital gains.. this is KEY)Rest is up to you... get trustworthy advice or keep it simple...Regards,The content on this post is for informational purposes only, you should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.
