,"So I recently learned that the MSCI index that VGT tracks is moving the three stocks I listed, as well as lots of others, out of the tech sector. I really liked VGT as a tech tilt because it has these “financial” stocks. What do you all think about the restructuring? How much do you think it will affect VGT?","With FedNow instant payments coming next year (with utility pricing of USD instant payments), it's a good time to better recognize these firms as finance versus tech. No explosive growth is coming, they're financial utilities.",0,0.56,0.906,POSITIVE

So, are you saying it’s a good thing for the tech sector to lose these stocks because of the limited growth potential?",1,0.541,0.533,POSITIVE

Otherwise, you’re buying indexes with suboptimal allocations (“there’s finance in my tech equity!”).",2,0.526,0.572,POSITIVE

A lot of the payment processor adjacent stocks (SQ, AFRM, FISV, etc) had a lot of growth in the past several years and I think removing them will negatively affect VGT's growth.Was there an official place you saw this? I found a Seeking Alpha article on it (not sure if links are allowed here) which seems to imply that changes like this are deliberately made more ""invisible"" to investors. And it also suggests that the reason for these rebalances is to keep sectors balanced, so investors won't abandon lagging sector ETFs which costs MSCI fees.",0,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE
