,"If the stock market is all about forward thinking and how much growth is expected, how much more room can these companies grow?",I’ve owned MA since the summer of 2009 and V for the last year. I have no intention of selling. Both are great in all economic situations. Booming economy people spend more. Poor economy people swipe more times in smaller transactions. It’s win-win. Both great long-term holdings IMO.,0,0.537,1.0,POSITIVE

,"If the stock market is all about forward thinking and how much growth is expected, how much more room can these companies grow?","Of course any precise answer is just a guess. The real question is their ability to penetrate emerging markets where cash still predominates. So it can be hugely exponential going forward. But it may be less than huge depending on what international competition and regulation gets in the way. Of course few will be better able to navigate such regulation than these two - new regulation is more likely to hurt their smaller competitors than it is to hurt V and MA. But it could also favor the home team in a foreign market.My best guess is that in the near term, after the big run up in share price of the last couple of years, there isn't going to be as much growth as many would hope for, but in the long run growth may still be surprisingly large.",0,0.544,0.97,NEGATIVE
,"If the stock market is all about forward thinking and how much growth is expected, how much more room can these companies grow?","I love them both because in the big picture, they have shown to be undefeated. Look at their charts, nothing but slow, steady growth year after year. You aren't going to get crazy rich off of them, but as far as consistent winners, it's tough to go wrong. Will it last forever? Maybe. Maybe not. That's why we have the sell button.",0,0.559,0.999,POSITIVE

,"If the stock market is all about forward thinking and how much growth is expected, how much more room can these companies grow?",The biggest risk to Visa and Mastercard in my opinion is the rise of mobile payment giants in Asia notably in China where there is little meaningful market penetration by Visa and Mastercard.,0,0.538,0.938,NEGATIVE

,"If the stock market is all about forward thinking and how much growth is expected, how much more room can these companies grow?","One thing you might find useful is to see what Visa themselves have to say about their growth opportunity. You could find that in their latest Investor Day presentation - as well as that, you could check out the transcript of everything that went down that day and get a lot more detail.With the transcript, be aware it’s a 72 page PDF that includes a Q&A segment with analysts there at the time - but Visa’s CEO specifically talks about their enormous growth potential and why he feels it's sustainable from pages 51 to 58.",0,0.526,0.931,NEGATIVE
,"If the stock market is all about forward thinking and how much growth is expected, how much more room can these companies grow?","They are overvalued right now, best time to buy them was in 2016 I’d say.

,"If the stock market is all about forward thinking and how much growth is expected, how much more room can these companies grow?","I'd just see what happens before/during the summer and make a first move during that time. I don't really see it going down within the span of a few years but short-term volatility might be the way to go. In short, invest if you think the company is good and can stay profitable, then the 10~$ difference won't mean as much after a few years of holding, imo.",1,0.548,0.968,NEGATIVE

,"If the stock market is all about forward thinking and how much growth is expected, how much more room can these companies grow?","What are you using for Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc? Your Visa, Mastercard, etc. Additionally, mobile payments haven't taken off in the US for a number of reasons (lack of NFC support, awareness, etc.) I think most people in this country (obviously this is unscentific) are so used to pulling out plastic that they're in the habit of it and mobile payments to them is a ""if it's not broke, why fix it"" in terms of using plastic. There are benefits to mobile payments but I don't think they've been promoted well. Samsung Pay is the only one where you can use it everywhere; the other two are held back by inconsistent NFC use (point of sale doesn't offer NFC, or it's turned off/not enabled) at point of sale. There's so many places I shop where the POS doesn't have NFC.Mobile payments needs to be like SamsungPay; it needs to be something where I can use it everywhere and not have to look at the POS terminal to see whether it's NFC enabled or not. Even with Samsung Pay though, it's awareness and changing habits (pulling out plastic) that have been going on for decades.It has a 0.000000000000001% chance of happening, but Apple buying Square in order to more aggressively push out payment infrastructure en masse in order to jumpstart Apple Pay acceptance while also getting a foothold into a large amount of small/medium and some large businesses to sell them subscription services (iBusiness? iMerchant?) isn't ludicrous. It'll never happen but it's not ludicrous.And I don't know that Apple wants to be making small business loans a la Square, but Square is trying to get a bank license and Apple buying a Square could be a way for Apple to enter into all manner of financial technology opportunities (payment processing, etc) and offering financial products to businesses and consumers. Apple already sells Square products, as well.So, again: it'll never happen but I don't think Apple going the financial and business services route via something like that is ridiculous at least in broad theory.",0,0.53,1.0,NEGATIVE

,"If the stock market is all about forward thinking and how much growth is expected, how much more room can these companies grow?","A few years ago, Walmart and other retailers (Target, Best Buy, CVS, etc) spent a ton of money building a mobile payment platform called MCX (then CurrentC). The problem was that you had to attach your bank account but also that you had to jump through hoops in terms of verification to even be able to do that.Walmart literally built MCX in order to create a mobile payments alternative that didn't include credit cards. It wasn't for the consumer benefit, it was for their benefit and the consumer wants to use cards. A couple of years later, MCX was shut down and I don't think they got past testing in a market or two.Now, you look at Walmart Pay (which has been successful in getting people to adopt) and it does note that you can use any credit or debit card, as well as Walmart gift cards, etc.) It doesn't note anything about bank accounts, which was the only option for MCX.It wouldn't surprise me if there are other non-card mobile payment account aps pushed in the future en masse, but I think it's been a difficult enough time convincing people to use mobile payments in the US as is, and I think that too many would be concerned (and really, question the benefit to them in terms of not getting points and not having card fraud protection) in terms of not using their cards for mobile payments.People like using cards in terms of rewards and fraud protection, CurrentC benefitted the retailer in terms of trying to avoid people using cards, but that didn't do anything for the customer. If anything, CurrentC and other things (carriers blocking Google Pay years ago because they wanted people to use their IsisPay (later changed to Softcard, then later Softcard was actually sold to Google) only served to take away from progress in mobile payment adoption.",2,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE

,"If the stock market is all about forward thinking and how much growth is expected, how much more room can these companies grow?","""how much more room can these companies grow?""Think about the business model which - as I've said before - is basically one of the most beautiful business models. It's basically a toll booth for money and over time, prices of things go up and Visa/Mastercard takes their fees from a gradually larger and larger $ amount.They aren't the ones extending credit to the consumer, so that credit risk is someone else's. American Express former CEO Ken Chennault upon retiring from Amex:""Breaking off the card networks “was one of the biggest strategic blunders of the last 20 years,” said Chenault, 66, who will step down as chairman and chief executive officer in February. “They didn’t understand what they were giving up, and they lost sight of where the puck was going. Along with yielding pricing power to the network, the banks also limited their access to data and merchant relationships at a critical time. “They gave it up on the cheap, and now the roles are totally reversed,” Chenault said, calling it one of the most amazing business stories of the past 20 years. “An industry literally transferred wealth over to two associations. They were nonprofits. That’s unbelievable.” (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-05/ken-chenault-s-parting-warning-banks-made-big-error-on-payments)I mean, think about it: how much more will e-commerce grow, how many sectors of the economy will start having to offer mobile payments that don't? How many businesses are now able to more cheaply get payment processing abilities that previously weren't via things like Square or Shopify? How many more digital payments in the restaurant industry are occuring today that weren't 5 years ago because of services like Grubhub? How many farmers market, flea market, art fair, music fair vendors, food trucks, etc will take cards 5 years from now? How many did 5 years ago? How many stores will start getting rid of checkout and move towards self checkout or cashiers walking around stores, how much will online delivery of groceries grow in the coming years? (a lot.) A lot has changed, but a great deal is still yet to change in how people buy things.There will be competition and I do think that Visa's enormous scale is a buffer against that but I see many more years - and if anything, I think there's a significant possibility of acceleration in a lot of digital payment themes that would benefit Visa.I think there's growth not only in Visa, but in other names - Square, Paypal, etc.",0,0.534,0.998,NEGATIVE

,"If the stock market is all about forward thinking and how much growth is expected, how much more room can these companies grow?","Like others have said, it all depends on emerging markets. Some markets are simply not conducive to using non-cash financial products. Mexico is a good example where cash is so ingrained into the culture that V and MA have spent millions trying to convince the population to switch with little to no impact at all. Also most businesses refuse to accept it because they don't want to pay the processing fees. For consumers it becomes more hassle than it is worth so everyone just sticks to using cash.It is also becoming an issue in the United States where lots of merchants are dumping the processing fees on to the consumer through ""convenience fees"".
