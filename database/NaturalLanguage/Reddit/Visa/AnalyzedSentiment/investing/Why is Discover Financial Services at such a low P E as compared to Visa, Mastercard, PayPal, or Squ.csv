,,Discover does a lot of loans as well as credit cards. Expectations is many loans are gonna default,0,0.514,0.741,POSITIVE
,,"Discover gives credit to people and doesn't have much growth. It's a business that is a fine enough business, but I think clearly people have been more enamored (and rightly so) with V/MA given that both are toll roads w/o credit risk.",0,0.533,0.998,NEGATIVE
,,Pretty sure Discover is known for being the first credit card for those with no credit. Credit cards are going to be the first debts to default,0,0.511,0.938,NEGATIVE

,,"SQ and PayPal shouldn’t be grouped into this Discover, AMEX, MA and V are all in the same exact category.",0,0.502,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"Discover and AMEX are a superset of MA and V, right? They are their own network (like MA and V), but also they are their own financial institution, which carries more risk, so I think MA and V are significantly better businesses, no?",1,0.526,0.951,NEGATIVE
,,I need to do more research but I think you are correct. Amex has some cards that are with banks tho,2,0.502,0.826,NEGATIVE
,,That’s correct,2,0.5,0.994,POSITIVE
,,Aren't they all payment processors for the most part?,1,0.512,0.959,POSITIVE
,,"MA/V/Discover/AMEX are payment networks. Processors will subscribe to one or more network to run their payments through. Square and Paypal just provide the hardware/software to processor payments through the credit card networks, they don't offer much in the way of alternate payment networks. When a merchant accepts a credit card, part of the fee they pay goes to the card network and part of it goes to the processor.",2,0.521,0.605,NEGATIVE
,,"Thank you, I appreciate this response.From my perspective, both the payment networks and processors are in the business of solving the same problem for businesses - making payments easy and convenient, and taking a cut of the payment for doing so.So their business outlook should be roughly correlated.So why is the price/earnings for Discover so low as compares to the other card networks? And the other payment processors, if we wanted to group them together?",3,0.54,0.642,POSITIVE
,,"Discover is also a bank, so they're more similar to Amex than to Visa or MC.",4,0.545,0.807,NEGATIVE
,,"It's less than half of AMEX's P/E as well.It looks like Discover has a lot of debt, which is making people skittish.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-discover-financial-servicess-nyse-113839364.html",5,0.512,0.999,NEGATIVE
,,"Yes, it's the debt and the (higher) risk that is the reason for the lower PE.",6,0.491,0.671,NEGATIVE
,,"Sort of but not really, do a tad bit more research.",2,0.502,0.999,NEGATIVE
,,That's what I'm trying to do with people in this sub! :p,3,0.583,0.843,POSITIVE
,,"Amex and all those places give credit to people and make money off interest and transactions. The others are mainly transaction, hardware and software based",4,0.523,0.889,POSITIVE
,,"Ok, so if Discover is in the same category as V and MA, why is its P/E so much lower?",5,0.492,0.993,NEGATIVE
,,It is almost like a bank too,6,0.533,0.972,NEGATIVE
,,"""Ok, so if Discover is in the same category as V and MA,""It's not tho. See what I said above.",6,0.596,0.998,NEGATIVE
,,"D is more similar to AMEX than to V, i think. both the former provide loans, while the latter is only a payment processor.",2,0.511,0.501,POSITIVE
,,"Unlike PayPal, V, or MA, Discover is not just a payment processor, they’re taking on the credit risk as well because they’re both the bank and the processor when it comes to their credit cards. When comparing Discover to Amex, one of the issues is that Amex has a wealthier client base and are far less likely to default. In addition, Discover also acts as a bank and they give out loans to people who are often less than credit worthy. Before corona they significantly increased their provision for loan loss and now with massive unemployment, those already risky loans will surely default.",0,0.519,0.522,POSITIVE
,,It's not as widely accepted and you nobody accepts it internationally. Try paying for something anywhere in Europe with a Discover card and they won't accept it.,0,0.517,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,well good thing that nobody is traveling right now.,1,0.535,0.998,POSITIVE
,,I looked this up the other day and the other comments are spot on. Only thing to add is that I don't think many people have even heard of them.,0,0.505,0.995,POSITIVE
