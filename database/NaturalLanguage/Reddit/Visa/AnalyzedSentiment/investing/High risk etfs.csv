I would suggest skewing toward small/micro as well as biotech/biopharma if you really want to swing for the fences.For example, the ARK Investment ETFs include several interesting options, two which might particularly interest you are $ARKG (genomics) and $ARKW (Web 2.0). There’s also $ARKK, which includes holdings from the three specialized ETFs. These are all managed ETFs, so they’re actively trading every day.Less risky is $IHI, which follows a health (medical devices) index, composed of most large- and giant-cap companies. It tracks similar to $VGT, a low-cost tech (IT) ETF. Neither of these are swing-for-the-fences plays, which is a trade-off for lower risk and lower volatility.You should also consider looking at emerging economies. For example, Argentina was poison in 2018 but the YTD return for $ARGT is over 40%.",0,0.519,0.999,NEGATIVE
