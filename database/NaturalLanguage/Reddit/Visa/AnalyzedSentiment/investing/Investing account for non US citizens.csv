,I am working in the US on a NAFTA visa which is not really a visa but rather a stamp in my passport. I tried to open an account with TD Ameritrade but they absolutely and definitively require a visa number which I don't have. I already have an account with Fidelity through my employer but wanted to open an account with TD for all their educational resources. Anybody ever had a similar experience? Any suggestions?,"Try calling to see if they have a global account that you can register for.Unfortunately, the patriot act among other regulation can make it difficult to have a US based brokerage account. Sometimes firms like Schwab, Vanguard or Fidelity have global accounts that semi side step some of the US rules. You have to call each of the firms to ask what they require.",0,0.518,0.988,NEGATIVE
