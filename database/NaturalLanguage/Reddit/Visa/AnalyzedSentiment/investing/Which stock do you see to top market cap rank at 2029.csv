,"Interesting note: 2010-2020 was a time of a huge shift in mindset of investors and landscale of large companies.For biggest part of 20th century, stock market was dominated by the same names: AT&T, Exxon, General Motors, IBM, General Electric. For 35 years from 1960 till 1995, these 4 companies rotate each other in TOP-3 list by market cap. In 2000s after dot com bubble, new names enters the list. We start seeing Microsoft, Walmart, Pfizer, Merk, big banks like Citigroup of Bank of America, while IBM drops off, but still Exxon and GE keeps their presence. 2010 list was dominated by high oil prices: Exxon, PetroChina, Royal Dutch Shell, Petrobas. And in 2010s the dramatic of change was unprecedented. Just in 10 years, 8 out of 10 top market cap companies drops from the list. The only 2 who remain are Microsoft & Apple. Now list consists of 7 tech stocks (even 8, if we count Visa as a tech company due to the full IT dependence of its payment system), with only JNJ and BRK as non-tech left. In the entire market history it was never the case like this. 10 years which changed absolutely everything on the market. Hence, the question: do you think FAAGM will dominate the world in next decade too, or new names (TSLA? NVDA?) are coming to take to royal place soon? Personally, in my opinion, current tech area is not properly regulated by anti-monopoly law (especially Facebook, owning information flow of 2bln people, and fully managed by Zuk, who holds majority of shareholders vote), and I will not be surprised to see FB & Google to be divided into different companies like it was century ago with Carnegi & Rockfeller companies. Amazon with P/E close to 150 and extreme low marginality (part of their strategy to kill all competitors, so-called, Amazon effect) eithr should increase marginality soon, or investors might correct the price of the company. Apple will live till new revolution personal device enters the market (NeuraLink?) and only for Microsoft I don't see the way it might fail soon.",I cannot imagine a future where Amazon isn't dominant in some way or another,0,0.512,0.975,NEGATIVE

They're already 1.5 trln companyAs an IT person I would say they're going into Oracle direction with thier AWS. Already now you won't deal with AWS without dedicated 2-3 specialised cloud engineers with certifications. Hundred of services, a lot of of them duplicate each other (just try to google how to enable logging & monitoring in AWS). The same was with Oracle 20 years ago, their RDBMS was like invetiable, but very very complex and the cost of adopting Oracle grew every year. The same story with AWS now, as for me.",1,0.54,0.999,NEGATIVE

,"Interesting note: 2010-2020 was a time of a huge shift in mindset of investors and landscale of large companies.For biggest part of 20th century, stock market was dominated by the same names: AT&T, Exxon, General Motors, IBM, General Electric. For 35 years from 1960 till 1995, these 4 companies rotate each other in TOP-3 list by market cap. In 2000s after dot com bubble, new names enters the list. We start seeing Microsoft, Walmart, Pfizer, Merk, big banks like Citigroup of Bank of America, while IBM drops off, but still Exxon and GE keeps their presence. 2010 list was dominated by high oil prices: Exxon, PetroChina, Royal Dutch Shell, Petrobas. And in 2010s the dramatic of change was unprecedented. Just in 10 years, 8 out of 10 top market cap companies drops from the list. The only 2 who remain are Microsoft & Apple. Now list consists of 7 tech stocks (even 8, if we count Visa as a tech company due to the full IT dependence of its payment system), with only JNJ and BRK as non-tech left. In the entire market history it was never the case like this. 10 years which changed absolutely everything on the market. Hence, the question: do you think FAAGM will dominate the world in next decade too, or new names (TSLA? NVDA?) are coming to take to royal place soon? Personally, in my opinion, current tech area is not properly regulated by anti-monopoly law (especially Facebook, owning information flow of 2bln people, and fully managed by Zuk, who holds majority of shareholders vote), and I will not be surprised to see FB & Google to be divided into different companies like it was century ago with Carnegi & Rockfeller companies. Amazon with P/E close to 150 and extreme low marginality (part of their strategy to kill all competitors, so-called, Amazon effect) eithr should increase marginality soon, or investors might correct the price of the company.
