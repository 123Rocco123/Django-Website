,"Forgive me if this a dumb question as I may not be thinking about all of the variables..... but wouldn’t investing in 4 of the biggest companies in the world be better than investing in a etf like SPY or VTI? For example, a portfolio consisting of Walmart, Visa, Microsoft, and McDonald’s. I understand that you aren’t as diversified as with the etf but do you really need to be? These companies are the definition of too big to fail. Their reach is global and they should be at the forefront of each of their sectors. I would guess your returns with this simple portfolio would be slightly better than either etf and you wouldn’t have to pay their fee. Please point out the flaws in my thinking, I’m here to learn.","Your logic is a bit circular: admittedly, if you’d been invested in just those 4 stocks, over the past decade yes you would have outperformed SPY. But, the only reason those 4 jump out as “big stocks” is because they’ve been the top performers of SPY over the past 10 years. If you’d looked at the “biggest” stocks 10 years ago, you might have picked GE, for example, and as a result have underperformed the market. So no, buying the current best stocks isn’t an easy hack to beating SPY, at least not in the long term. Only way you’re gonna beat it is with careful market research and good predictions about the futures of these companies.",0,0.533,0.93,NEGATIVE

My investments are securely tied up in target date funds and broad index etfs. This was just a thinking out loud post to get some insight from people smart than me at this.

That gives you an opportunity to do better than VTI alone without all the risk that comes with owning just 4.

Also, if you can match the S&P without holding the exact index, you needn't license from S&P.But even if you only hold the largest 100 stocks in the S&P, you introduce significant ""tracking error"" -- and because we have S&P 100 funds, we can compare these returns to the 500 stock flavor. . . and the answer is, the S&P 100 trails the S&P 500, by a considerable margin.I have seen quantitative finance guys show work where they claim that you can capture much of the S&P 500 with 30 stocks or so, but I've never seen anyone suggest they can do it with fewer than 10.",0,0.523,0.875,NEGATIVE
