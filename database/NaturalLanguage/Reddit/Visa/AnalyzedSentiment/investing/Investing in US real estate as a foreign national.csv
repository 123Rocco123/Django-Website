,"Hi folks, As the title states, need some advice on foreign nationals investing in US real estate. My friends parents who have nothing to do with US beyond a visitor visa would like to move their savings into US real estate. My friend lives in the US and can help with stuff. They would be able to afford to buy a small but in good condition single family home with cash. Thinking to rent it out. Is this a good idea? Can anyone share what the process looks like, gotchas, etc? Thank you","I realize that this is the investing subreddit, but I kindly ask that they invest in the stock market instead of real estate.
