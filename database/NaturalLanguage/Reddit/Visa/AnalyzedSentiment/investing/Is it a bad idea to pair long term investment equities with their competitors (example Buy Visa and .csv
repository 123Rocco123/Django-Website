,"It seems, for long term investing, they usually seem to rise together. Why not just buy both? Is there a name for this kind of investing so I can research it more? Thoughts?","One could argue that in an uncompetitive market (duopoly, oligopoly) the lack of a clear ""winner"" means holding all relevant companies is better - in expectation - than only owning one.Of course one stock might technically outperform the other, but if you just make an industry play rather than a stock specific play then buying all relevant stocks seems a better way to diversify against the risk of not being in the better stock.You point out payments (Visa, MasterCard, PayPal) but I can also think gaming (EA, Activision, TakeTwo), graphics cards (AMD, Nvidia), etc.",0,0.56,0.999,NEGATIVE

Thoughts?","You’re gona get different answers based on one’s investing philosophy. The entire sector is growing and you don’t know which stock will grow the most vs. why would you compete with yourself?I see no issue with buying companies that compete with each other..and neither do a lot of the greatest investors.

,"It seems, for long term investing, they usually seem to rise together. Why not just buy both? Is there a name for this kind of investing so I can research it more? Thoughts?","It is a good idea if there are few competitors (only 2-3 real competitors) in an industry, high demand for that product, and high barriers to entry, which is why that Visa/Mastercard idea has done so well.Less so with the Ford/GM example, because there are too many companies so both could do badly.",0,0.533,0.993,NEGATIVE

,"It seems, for long term investing, they usually seem to rise together. Why not just buy both? Is there a name for this kind of investing so I can research it more? Thoughts?","I wouldn’t simply from the standpoint that while you are diversifying away some company specific risk, you’re over-exposing yourself to sector specific risk.In an “efficient” portfolio of multiple stocks, the end result should be that you diversify away company and sector risk so that you are only left with market risk (beta).",0,0.569,0.991,NEGATIVE

Thoughts?","Buying all the competitors in a sector equally is a pretty normal thing, its how literally all index investors invest.So, you should buy both unless you are speculating that you believe your ability to price assets outperforms the market.
