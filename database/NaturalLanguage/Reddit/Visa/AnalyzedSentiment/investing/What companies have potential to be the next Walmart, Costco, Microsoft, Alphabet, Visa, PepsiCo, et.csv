I'm not asking about companies like Amazon, Nvidia, or Tesla, whose success would have been quite difficult to predict at the time. However, I believe that most of the companies such as Walmart, Costco, Microsoft, Alphabet, Visa, and PepsiCo could have been predicted to have potential to become the size that they are today near their early stages. What other companies do you think currently have this potential?","Anything like PepsiCo is extremely hard because once a food company reaches a certain size they usually get acquired. Also retail like Walmart has such an advantage in terms of pricing it would be hard to compete there.I think maybe companies like uipath, c3ai, pltr. Competing in the ai space have huge opportunities going forward. Also companies like qunatamscape trying to find ways to store energy more effectively.Not saying any of these will be the winners but this is where is look to find the next big opportunity",0,0.546,0.995,NEGATIVE

So there really is no way to reliably or safely dog pile money into one. Your best bet would be to research companies worth <$50B and try to come up with a list of 20-30 stocks that have a ton of potential to become Titans of Industry, and buy them all. If you successfully bag one that becomes the next Alphabet chances are over 10-30 years the gains from it would more than make up for the losses of the others.",0,0.545,1.0,NEGATIVE

This can lead to incorrect conclusions because of incomplete data.But that's not true - not all of the people have come up empty. As you said, it is not impossible, it is merely difficult.You're literally focusing on the entities that passed a selection process (i.e beat The Market) while overlooking those that did not.What in the world mathematics are you talking about?If you were to randomly pick an investor who tried to beat The Market, they are much more likely to have failed than succeed. The probability of an investor beating the market - regardless of their skills and abilities - is astonishingly small.More Evidence That It’s Really Hard to ‘beat the Market’ over Time, 95% of Finance Professionals Can’t Do ItStated differently, over the last 15 years from June 30, 2003 to June 30, 2018, only one in 13 large-cap managers, only one in 21 mid-cap managers, and one in 43 small-cap managers were able to outperform their benchmark index. So it is possible for some active fund managers to “beat the market” over various time horizons, although there’s no guarantee that they will continue to do so in the future. And the percentage of active managers who do beat the market is usually pretty small – fewer than 8% in most of the cases above over the last 15 years; and they may not sustain that performance in the future. For many investors, the ability to invest in low-cost, passive, unmanaged index funds and outperform 92% of high-fee, highly paid, professional active fund managers seems like a no-brainer, especially considering it requires no research or time trying to find the active managers who beat the market in the past and might do so in the future.So, you're absolutely right: if you only focus on the individuals who beat the market (the literal definition of survivorship bias) then you can come away with the conclusion that it is a viable and feasible strategy and it is one that someone should and ought to do.However, when you include everyone who failed to beat the market you realize that while possible, the chances of someone beating the market is roughly 5-10% and therefore trying to beat the market is a bad strategy given expected returns. You're much better off taking a 95% chance of matching the market than a 5% chance of beating the market.A staggering percentage of American adults don't understand lots of stuff, including basic math... and yet others are able to deliver miracles like vaccines, GPS, WiFi, decoding the human genome.As you yourself have so eloquently demonstrated =)",4,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE
