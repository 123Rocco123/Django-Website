,"Hello everybody! I’m a college student that would like to start investing some of my spare money at the end of each month. As I’m not too familiar with investing, I wanted to ask for some advice. I was thinking of either putting the money into an ETF or a small group of stocks. On the ETF side, I caught a glimpse of some popular ETFs that are often recommended on this and other subreddits, so I was thinking of maybe investing in the S&P 500 or MSCI? If I were to go the small group of company stock route, I would probably go into the direction of Apple, Tesla, Visa, Microsoft, Amazon, Thermofischer. Though I’m not sure as to if I should split the money equally amongst the 6 or if it’s better to invest more into one than the other etc? I would really appreciate some advice. Thank you in advance and I hope you all have a nice day!","VTI/VXUS and then don't look back. Avoid individual stocks as much as you can (but I don't follow this advice because I like to have a little fun). International diversification is important.I'd aim for 70% VTI and 30% VXUS. If you want something a bit easier, just do 100% VT for full diversificatation.The S&P 500 is a fine alternative for VTI, I just prefer the diversity of VTI.",0,0.512,0.967,NEGATIVE
