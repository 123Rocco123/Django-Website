At the Port of Los Angeles, 145 drivers have been laid off and others have been sent home without pay as massive ships from China stopped arriving and work dried up. At travel agencies in Atlanta and Los Angeles, several workers lost their jobs as bookings evaporated. Christie Lites, a stage-lighting company in Orlando, laid off more than 100 of its 500 workers nationwide this past week and likely will lay off 150 more, according to chief executive Huntly Christie. Meanwhile a hotel in Seattle is closing an entire department, a former employee said, and as many as 50 people lost their jobs after the South by Southwest festival in Austin got canceled. Economists fear more layoffs in the coming weeks as supply chains come to a halt and people stay home and spend less. “We will definitely see an effect on jobs from the coronavirus, and it could be pretty large in leisure and hospitality,” said Julia Pollak, labor economist at ZipRecruiter. “The first thing we’ll see is a reduction in hours. We hear many reports of employers canceling staff everywhere except in health care.” Monday in Los Angeles, Sam Creighton and about 20 colleagues were fired from the China Visa Service Center. Creighton helped Americans get travel documents to China, but business plummeted as groups and individuals canceled trips to Asia out of virus fear.

I had 21 events from Maine to Hawaii cancel on me, today. ""That is 100% of my business through May 1. Good thing I have SPY puts expiring 4/7. Short it boys, let my autistic and anecdotal story be your trailer park version of insider trading.In size, both. The big events have been slowly dropping for a couple weeks internationally and today was when the wave hit. The closer we get to spring, the closer we are to deadlines on 45 day out vendor contracts. Any event of any decent size that is run competently (by someone like me who is hired for this purpose), will put all our major expenses on contracts that don’t commit me to anything until a lock-in period. Those are 60, 30 and most popular 45 days before event day. That means that an event 45 days from now, in other words all your major spring races across the US are right now, faced with the decision to spend hundreds of thousands of non refundable dollars today and risk the US doing what Austin and Silicon Valley already did. Any client that asked for my advice on if they should commit I strongly encouraged them to cancel. As it’s currently socially and culturally acceptable to do it, like it’s not a bad PR reason to cancel an event. Also, no event or brand will be able to survive the PR storm that comes with being labeled the City of Bumfuckville Marathon that was the source of your states outbreak. There’s no coming back from that.So to answer another part of your question I have clients as small as a museum that puts on a 5k fundraiser to some roles in the biggest road races and cycling races in the US.Hi Man,I own a Security Guard company in Vancouver, and honestly I will say the same damn thing, I have had 5 festivals cancel for me for the Summer time. So far at a loss of almost 40k. I am planning on having to lay off people, but yes this is definitely real.Vegas will get hit hard.Not gonna name it, but think about the Tokyo marathon that cancelled, Paris marathon. Well that’s my industry in the US. Google the top 5 endurance event companies in the US. Their parent companies are all publicly traded.I run tech events and BARELY got away with holding our San Francisco event last week (had it been a day later we would have cancelled). Next event is in June in another West Coast hot spot and we've already booked a backup alternate date so sponsors don't get skiddish, but I'm planning as if it's happening and making the final call the first week of May. I'm paying the deposits for all our vendors because while we're freaked out, they are straight up not working right now. Branding vendor we partner with has lost all their comicon installation business and all their warehouse teams are on furlough. Our furniture rental partner is new to the scene and just dumped a bunch into new inventory for the spring season, and right now I'm the only good call they've had all week.Our clients/sponsors are all tech companies and haven't blinked at the June date YET but we'll see in a few weeks. I am long on elearning companies like K12.My company sells equipment to movie theaters. We are fucked when people stop going to the theaters. Good thing our convention is in Las Vegas at the end of the month.I own a company that rents diesel generators and temporary power distribution to medium / large events.

Let's take something like restaurants into consideration. The ones who specialize in deliveries may actually thrive in this market but most restaurants that depend on foot traffic or has high markups and depend on ambience to attract customers will suffer or shutter. They have to keep paying expensive rent and other overhead costs while customers may take months to slowly return.Expect a lot of businesses to start massive layoffs. Vulnerable Asian airlines will be first. Many airlines like China Airline are already halting recruiting new flight attendants. Others like Cathay Pacific which has negative operating cash flow are asking their crew to take up to month long unpaid leave. They are canceling up to 50% of their flights stretching into at least march. How can they possibly remove the threat of this virus if no treatment/vaccine has been developed? The reason they are shutting down flights will therefore persist, and they will suffer a prolonged period of diminished business.There will be a feedback loop. There are many industries we can FOR SURE predict big problems for in 2020. We are guaranteed to see layoffs in airlines (especially Asian airlines) in the coming months. Set a reminder on this comment if you don't believe. I can even name you specific companies that will probably go bankrupt.Layoffs will compound upon itself. When airlines, hotels, restaurants, malls, etc are firing workers, the workers won't have money to spend on buying things. This means other businesses may suffer enough to also start firing some workers. Businesses in 2020 overall are so overleveraged that a large percentage of them are not going to be able to handle even a few months of lower business. They simply can't pay all the expenses and the debt obligation.And yet when posting such obvious prediction on this subreddit, you would get berated, insulted, and threatened. The Mods even delete your threads and your comments.If anyone is interested, this is the follow up thread:https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fede69/continued_thoughts_on_the_global_economic_impact/Please read the possibility of a paradigm shift in the above thread as this is not being discussed and will still be ridiculed and scoffed at on this subreddit even though its scientific possibility is perfectly valid.This is not a financial crisis, this is a virus that has extremely unique characteristics that make it an agent for paradigm shift if it manages to mutate enough to avoid full vaccination like various mutating seasonal flu strains.Beyond the deaths, sickness, layoffs, bankruptcies, the most crucial news that matters for humanity is the mutations of this virus. This virus CANNOT be allowed to mutate like the seasonal flu while retaining characteristics like up to 14+ days of asymptomatic spread and high hospitalization rates. If it does, then this is a paradigm shift for humanity and the global economy. How we live will change and entire industries like cruises will disappear or change so radically as to be unrecognizable. This is a distinctly possible outcome of this virus, the more hosts this virus gets, the more chances it has to mutate. We already have 2 strains of this virus with the newer strain being more aggressive and it has been reported that its possible to catch both strains (get sick twice) although we need peer review studies on this (which will take months or years).",0,0.517,1.0,NEGATIVE

Instead, unwarranted personal insults were hurled my way. And my comments were deleted.When I posted the information from the second thread I linked to here, I received even MORE hate and vitriol.

Creighton helped Americans get travel documents to China, but business plummeted as groups and individuals canceled trips to Asia out of virus fear. The company processed around 400 visas a month; in February, that number fell to 22. The visa center did not return a request for comment.

I was imagining a scenario in which the disease may be contained and a global economic downturn could be prevented. We've seen this before with SARS and MERS. However, the 14+ days asymptomatic outliers destroyed this possibility for me. And I had to highlight this to reinforce why a global economic downturn was all but inevitable without a treatment/vaccine. A single case can cause a cluster very quickly, and any detection of new clusters will prompt economic actors to drastically and negatively change their behavior. Any realistic containment attempts would only slow the spread, no eliminate it. We need medicine to have any hope of stopping it.",6,0.515,0.98,NEGATIVE

Here is my take:Infection will level off, much like China's.Yes, people will continue to get sick but there will be a point were exponential infection declines and new infections will be lower than recovery rates.The business that go bankrupt, new business will take their place. Governments will provide stimulus to stuggling businesses while we go through this time anyways.A vaccine is a year or two away. There are lots of people who dont vaccinate anyways. When I say lots, I really mean billions. Its a miracle those people are still alive. Vaccines dont always work, either.Once our understanding of the disease actualizes, fear will decline. The fear is much more contagious, and dangerous, than the disease itself. Fear causes people to act irrationally.Financial recovery wont take years, but months.
