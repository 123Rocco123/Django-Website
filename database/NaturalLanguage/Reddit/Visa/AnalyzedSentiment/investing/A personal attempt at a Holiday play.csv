,"In 2021, following Jim Cramer’s discussion on his show, I tried to make a Memorial day play. I moved most of my emergency fund into my brokerage account just before the holiday and purchased Visa (V) with it. I discovered I couldn’t set stop losses and automatic triggers to sell to lock in gains on the same shares. This ended up being quite stressful for me as I tried to set stops (for loss and gain) on portions of the shares, leaving me exposed to losses on some of the shares. I was monitoring these shares daily, wondering if gains were temporary and what would happen the next day. Should I lock in small gains to ensure I didn’t lose, or should I let it run? I lump sum purchased and sold in four lots. I tried to sell in a way to lock in minimal profit, but leave room to make more. In the end, it was an unpleasant experience. With my small to the world, yet large to me, investment of about $9K, I just wasn’t able to make that much profit. I was constantly worried about losing my capital. In the two weeks I did this, I made only $200 on the investment/sale. That is 2.2%, which in only 2 weeks isn’t so bad I guess, and crudely could be looked at as 57% annual (if you could repeat and sustain it). The experience left me assured that day trading isn’t for me, and that you need money to make money. Thoughts?","A TON of research has gone into evaluating outcomes of day trading.My favourite body of work has been done by Terrance & Odean out of UC Davis and BerkeleyIn their 2013 Paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1386418113000190Highlights that “less than 1% of the day trader population in Taiwan is able to predictably and reliably earn a positive return net of fees”I would say confidently, that you probably have better odds in a casino.They have done a lot of additional research that can be found:https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/Papers%20current%20versions/Individual_Investor_Performance_Final.pdfhttps://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/Papers%20current%20versions/JustHowMuchDoIndividualInvestorsLose_RFS_2009.pdfhttps://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/Papers%20current%20versions/Individual_Investor_Performance_Final.pdfhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3423101The TLDR is something like this:Day trading is hazardous to your wealth, the majority of people who attempt it, lose money.This is irrefutable in the empirical data.Furthermore, the prime culprit of day trading persistence is “Overconfidence”There is a famous 2018 National Survey that asked 700 men to evaluate themselves on friendliness, athletic ability and intelligence.100% of men thought they were friendlier than average95% thought they were smarter than average94% thought they were more athletic than averageIF I had to guess - if you surveyed ALL day traders I would guess that at least 80% believe they are a better than average day traderAnd given the above empirical data, you need to be in the top 1% to actually be profitable.",0,0.513,0.998,NEGATIVE
