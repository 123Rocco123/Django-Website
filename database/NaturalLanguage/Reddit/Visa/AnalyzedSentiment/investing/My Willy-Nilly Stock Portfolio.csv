,"Hey, guess what! I'm beating the market YTD! My make-believe portfolio is up 12.2% vs. 11.8% for VOO, a whopping 0.4% advantage. The portfolio holds 38 company stocks. The thing is, I picked the stocks more or less at random — just companies that I've heard of and ""seemed"" like they might do well going forward. No analysis, no research, no balance sheets or company reports, more like ""selective dart throwing"". I think the returns are purely the product of luck and realize that my lead over VOO could evaporate at any time. We'll see. It kind of proves Peter Lynch's belief that any moax can beat the market but with a caveat: if you're lucky.
