I will admit that when I saw some of your earlier posts on bank holdings, I was somewhat intrigued. I was wondering if you had some kind of thesis based on this information. The problem with your post is that it's not contextualized.For one thing - these are WFA holdings and not related to Wells Fargo as a bank.It doesn't make any sense to compare 13f of bank holding companies. If you look at a bank like State Street Bank - it's going to look huge because of all the ETFs managed by SSgA.You admitted to me in your similar post about Citigroup that ""There is no conclusion to be drawn really. It’s just the Top 50 holdings at Citigroup held by investors.""So when u/enginerd03 asked about the value of this post - you did escalate the situation with your own response.",2,0.52,0.998,NEGATIVE
