,"I am a Indian Citizen. I am married to a US citizen in Aug 2022. I was in the US for about 12 years under H1B visa (NO GREEN CARD). I moved back to India last year (2023) in July along with my wife, a year after I got married. I still have my ESPP, 401k and personal investments (MFs and ETFs) in the US. I don't have plans to do anything with my 401K for now other than rolling it over to an IRA. So I am not worried about that. But I am a little worried about company stock that I accumulated through ESPP and personal investments. Because I saw in some places the international tax rate in 30% for international investors. I want to sell especially the ESPP, so I can diversify. And I have a few questions, I am looking to get answered and hope the community can help me with this. Considering I am in India now, Generally, what are the taxes for international investors? Do international investors not have the ability to claim long term capital gains? I also recently learnt of the W-8BEN (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf) which is to be submitted to the brokerages for proper withholding. When am I supposed to submit this form? And what am I supposed to fill in the ""Special rates and conditions"" condition? I am reading through the US-India tax treaty (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/india.pdf). But it is all Greek and Latin to me. Does anyone have any experience with this type of thing? Do I need to fill anything in the special rates and conditions section? How does it work if my wife who is a US citizen files taxes for us jointly? Or is it even possible to file jointly, if I am not a US person and we are both out of the country?","Please read IRS publication 519 for alien taxation here - https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-519Generally if you file a W8BEN to your brokerages in US, you are eligible for a reduced treaty withholding rate of 25% on dividends. Capital gains on shares is exempt for non-resident aliens (NRA)Please be aware of a very low estate tax liability in US for NRA at $60000.In India, you are exempt from tax & reporting on US income & assets till you are an RNOR as per Indian income tax act post which your US income will be taxable in India as well. For 401k/IRA there is a beneficial provision in terms of Section 89A which allows you a tax deferral of income in India till its withdrawal in US.",0,0.517,NEGATIVE,0.996
