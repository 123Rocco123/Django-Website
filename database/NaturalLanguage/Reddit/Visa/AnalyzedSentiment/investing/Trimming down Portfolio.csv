,"My M1 brokerage portfolio contains 17 stocks. My highest allocated stocks are Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Costco, Google, Disney and Berkshire Hathaway. These stocks I will always own. My next group of stocks are lower allocated- Visa, Mastercard, AMD, NVDA, Johnson and Johnson, Waste Management, Pepsi, McDonalds, Sony and Nike. I am only looking to hold for long term being that I am a young investor. I place $300 into these stocks every week. My top priority is on growth stocks and companies that I feel certain are strong and that will be around for a log time. What stocks would you guys recommend I cut loose based on my priorities, so I can grow my holdings in the other stocks faster?","PepsiCo, Sony, and McDonald's will all have questionable very long term futures. I would not be surprised if McDonalds and PepsiCo are value stocks decades from now. I would not bank on sugar and fast food products growing as much as integrated hardware like AMD or a sports brand like Nike",0,0.547,0.996,NEGATIVE

Love him or hate him buffet has shown he can and will run a profitable fund. In addition many of the wealthiest people in the world own shares in Brk with huge portions of their wealth invested that way and they put lots of faith into Buffets abilities. This paired with the fact that he has access to inside information and deals due to all of his connections means he’s more likely to know a market trend before it happens or even score an inside deal to buy a large chunk of a company for large discounts. No matter how good I get I don’t have those connections. I will never be able to have market maker knowledge, best I can do is put my money (some of it) with someone who does. That’s the argument anyway.",0,0.534,0.936,POSITIVE

They just have too much uncertainty due to the Coronavirus. Short term I keep seeing basically their price will be stagnant for a year or so because Disney+ is not profitable yet and they are hemorrhaging money with no parks, cruises, or movie theaters open. Also movie production has been at a stand still",0,0.538,1.0,NEGATIVE

Stuff people buy as a status symbol BECAUSE it is over priced is too risky for my tastes. Clothing stores like that go out of business all the time.Sony and Nike are kinda the same, just to a lesser extent. I don't think what they make is better enough to warrant the price tags attached. At least they aren't nearly as bad as Apple, though.I wouldn't accuse the other companies of having prices massively overpriced in relation to their competitors.",0,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE

Most people I know (work and family) use iPhones (I’d guess 85%), a few MacBook users, Apple TV scattered Apple watches ... nobody considers them status symbols ... I think the bulk of Apple buyers are just price insensitive to a point. Obviously I’m giving an anecdote but I just think a ton of Apple buyers are not “buy for status” buyers who will - to use the example of a hyped up clothing store - flip to a new phone that becomes high status. Most iPhone users I know don’t actually care if the new Samsung is better. They’re just really heavily locked into the Apple ecosystem and would need a compelling reason to change. A few hundred bucks is not a compelling reason.It’s the same story I hear about Starbucks which same people clearly do see as a status thing. I wonder how much those people actually spend at Starbucks vs the masses of workers who hit Starbucks multiple times a day, where it’s their -basic- coffee and the cheapest one they consider drinkable.",1,0.525,1.0,NEGATIVE

Apple is what every old person I know uses. Android is for broke kids. Idk you might be right I just run into masses of Apple buyers and they all pretty much just don’t seriously consider android. They don’t think Apple is cool. It’s just what they’re used to and they don’t want to invest time changing, or found android too much hassle.From a cost-benefit standpoint they simply prioritize ease of use and fast learning curve very, very highly.I’ve glanced at android stuff before but I have to basically do tech support for my whole family and there’s no way I’m moving them all or splitting ecosystems.The more Apple you buy the easier it is to keep buying Apple everything.",3,0.514,0.995,POSITIVE

They purposefully don't use the same open standards that everybody uses and they purposefully make their stuff as uncompatible with everything else as possible.It has nothing to do with running a good business or making a good product and everything to do with anti-competitive business practices.
