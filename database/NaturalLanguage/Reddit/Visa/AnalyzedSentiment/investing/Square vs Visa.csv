,Looking to jump into the money game. Visa fits my investing thesis more and am going to get a stake in it probably before it's next earnings report. Love their financials and history. However I'm curious who here likes square more/less and why? I've been considering this one too although I'm less inclined to invest in less established companies that don't make a profit. Havevn't looked into them as much because I live in Australia and have only seen them used a couple times ever in person. Also I'd appreciate disclosure if you hold either these companies or competitors :),"Not an apples to apples comparison. Square processes payments but makes point of sale products (square register) that in many ways exist as a platform for it to offer the business services (loans, payroll, etc.) Visa is solely payment processing but visa does have (by far) the largest market share of the card companies. The payments space has been my favorite space for a long time but I do think that it will become increasingly competitive and I do think you will see Amazon start to offer financial products. I own Square, Visa and Amazon.",0,0.545,0.758,POSITIVE

But their technology isn't unique and they could be replaced at any time. AMZN and V have been around for a long time and are already solidly entrenched in their markets. It would take a decade or more for a startup to eat their lunch.Edit: Those 3 companies are also complementary.

Havevn't looked into them as much because I live in Australia and have only seen them used a couple times ever in person. Also I'd appreciate disclosure if you hold either these companies or competitors :),"I've just come to think of Square as the Square register being a trojan horse to get a foothold in the business, then it's going to offer the business an increasing amount of services.I just say you have to think of Square as a payments company, but also it's going to increasingly over time be a business subscription services company with the register as a platform.""Shares of Square Inc. SQ, -4.48% are up 3.4% in Thursday morning trading after Jefferies analyst Ramsey El-Assal reiterated his positive view on the stock and cheered the company's ""subscription and services"" offerings. Such products, which include instant deposits, food delivery, and small-business loans, currently make up 26% of Square's adjusted net revenues, but El-Assal thinks they could account for about half by 2022. He predicts that instant deposits and Caviar food delivery will be among the fastest growers. ""Our thesis is that as S&S becomes a larger part of the overall business, SQ should carry a higher valuation multiple,"" El-Assal wrote."" (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/square-services-business-could-make-up-half-of-revenue-by-2022-says-analyst-2018-03-29)From the Square Q4 shareholder letter: ""In 2014 we started to meaningfully expand our ecosystem and complement our core managed payments and point-of-sale business with new products such as Square Capital, Caviar, Invoices, Instant Deposit, and Build with Square APIs. Products launched since 2014 continue to scale, and in the fourth quarter of 2017 they generated 36% of Adjusted Revenue, up from 25% in the prior year period. We are able to efficiently market these products to our base. Our machinelearning models analyze signals (e.g., business name, items or services sold, peak payment times, number of employees) across millions of sellers to provide actionable insights for cross-selling opportunities. We leverage these insights to create personalized messages and campaigns that we send to our sellers through email, in-app notifications, and banners in Square Dashboard. Our Account Management team also leverages the insights from our machine-learning models to proactively respond or to inform outreach: which sellers to contact, at what time, regarding which product(s). Collectively, these cross-sell strategies resulted in approximately 300,000 product adoptions in 2017.""If Square gets the banking license that it is trying to get, that opens up a whole array of other possibilities. Best case scenario I can see Square being a very different company 5-10 years away. There's also the now themes with Square of all of the small businesses (antique fairs, farmers markets, etc) that are increasingly wanting to take electronic payments. If things ever went cashless, the amount of people who would have to is mind-boggling.An analyst said earlier in March that ""Like Amazon in its early days, we believe that little of Square's future revenue streams are currently visible,"" the firm's analyst writes. I wouldn't go as far as to make the Amazon comparison, but I would agree that I think there is a significant path ahead for Square to evolve and potentially a lot that isn't there yet.There's also the fintechs for banks (Fiserv, FIS, Jack Henry), Paypal, Shopify and other companies. Tencent (which I also own) has WePay in China where payments are increasingly cashless and either AliPay or WePay.If you're in Australia and the whole trade war thing keeps going on, I'd look at food/wine producers in Australia. https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/02/china-tariff-hit-for-us-agriculture-could-be-big-gain-for-australia.html",2,0.547,0.964,POSITIVE

Now is a good time to buy both.V- pros: high margins, great moat, great tailwind, has the largest market share of payment processors. Lower volatility. Safer option. Cons: imo only markets are countries that have been using credit cards for a while. China and India are going straight to mobile payments. High p/e. Small risk of being displaced by crypto currency in the far future.Sq- pros: first movers advantage, still in high growth mode, expanding into new areas of growth. Greater potential of being the next amazon Cons: doesn’t have a moat. Lots of competition. Really high p/e. Meh: could be bought out.Recently bought more fb and nvda because I see these going up a bunch once the selloff is done. With the profits I’m buying MOAT etf which has V in the top ten holdings.
