,"So I have a theory that I'd like feedback and criticism on. To start, there is one thing that has stuck with me after hearing it from a financial advisor who does very well for himself. He said ""in every persons life there will be a 5-10yr period in which everyone can make a ton of money. It happens about once in every persons timeline if you are lucky. for example there was the roaring 20's and next was the 90's dot.com boom."" That got me thinking about this run we have been seeing the large companies go on in the last several months (AAPL, AMD, VISA, etc.) then I started to realize how commercials for Acorns and other passive investment companies work. I also noticed how robinhood now gives free stock to new investors. Also to my point the younger generation has been investing (mainly using these two companies mentioned) and so not only is there a large new inflow of money, but also these companies are pushing the big names on these new investors. If all this new money is coming in and there is a this new fad of investing spare change in to stocks, isn't the only way to go, up? I started thinking, maybe this is the time in my lifetime that I can ride an unreasonable wave. Do these factors of the companies like acorns, and robinhood giving you a stock for free (giving incentive for you to put more money in to that stock) possibly have the amount of users and influence to keep these large company stocks rising? thoughts?","If all this new money is coming in and there is a this new fad of investing spare change in to stocks, isn't the only way to go, upOh you sweet summer child.Sarcasm aside, markets aren't driven by retail investors rounding up pennies. Or a free stock on a free brokerage platform. Enough of their money certainly could have some affect, but overall they do not drive market action.

(Haven’t done this in a while so it could have changed). It is public knowledge on who the top holders of a company are. For instance 7ish% of apple is owned by Vanguard I think. That’s like 50 billion dollars. So I don’t think everyone in the world using acorn everyday to only buy Apple would make much of a difference.,2,0.54,0.997,NEGATIVE

The term is overused.A bubble is when prices greatly exceed the value of the underlying assets, but people keep paying the higher prices, not because of the value of what they are purchasing, but because they are betting someone else will come along to pay even more.You can make an argument that many tech stocks will never make enough E to justify their P.

The real money nowadays as I understand it though is ETFs, more and more people are using them, which has the potential for an across the board PE change in the market just because of the sheer volume increase of money invested.Say the market has a normal PE of 15 and money goes in but the companies continue to produce at the same level, that can change the PE, so you make more money because there’s a bigger pool.As for your financial advisor, he’s right and not. The dot com bubble was a bubble, a feedback loop, the 20s seemed to be more general prosperity but then there was a crash in 29 that gutted the market.
