,"The current single stocks I hold are AMZN, AAPL, VISA & T I might sell T and I don't think I'll need more than 3 stocks. I also hold VTI which is what my largest position is in, I loaded it up so that if my single stock positions didn't turn out how I wanted it wouldn't matter that much. I also had to purchase quite a lot of VHDYX in case I blew too many accounts trading so that I've got passive income I can get by on. I'm hedged with RGLD ABX GOLD (ticker & physical) I plan on selling those positions if they work out in my favor the next recession and then use that money to rebuy more VTI or single stocks. That's my entire portfolio. Any thoughts or ideas ? Much appreciated.",And why sell it? I love T right now.,0,0.52,0.739,POSITIVE

They’re both US based giant tech companies and will share a lot of the same fate. Good companies, pick 1.Visa is a fine company but incredibly richly valued. So it might take a turn lower on its way upward. Be prepared.T is a shit stock. Do not own T in a long term portfolio. It’s going bankrupt, a KHC-like value trap. Look at EV/Earnings vs Price/Earnings. It’s far too expensive for its debt and earnings.Hedging with gold is a pretty good strategy but I wouldn’t fuck around with physical gold. If the stock market ever crashes enough to where physical gold matters more than stocks, the world you live in is going to not be worth living in anyway. Yes there is a slight advantage of lower expense ratio, but there’s also theft/loss risk.",0,0.555,1.0,NEGATIVE

As for AAPL & AMZN I do believe that they're equally valuable for unique reasons, both of them with visa I've held for years.The gold I hold doesn't have be valued over my stocks, it just have to rise in price for which I'll sell and buy back some hopefully devalued shares.",1,0.53,0.938,NEGATIVE
