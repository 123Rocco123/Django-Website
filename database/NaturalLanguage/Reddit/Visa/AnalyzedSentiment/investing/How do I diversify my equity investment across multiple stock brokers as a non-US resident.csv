,"I am a non-US resident (I am from India) and have never been to the US, either. So, my options for stock brokers are very limited. There is Schwab and IBKR that accept international clients. However, outside of that, no major broker accepts international clients. I am investing all my life savings through Schwab over the year. While they have good customer support, there is always a fear of account getting blocked or something. I don't have a US visa, so I can't physically go to their branch. So it will be a very scary situation if something happens with my account there. There are some small brokers like Firstrade, Tradaestation, eToro, Trading212, Webull, and Moomoo that accept international clients. Should I transfer some of my portfolio to them? Suggestions?",Is this available: https://www.interactivebrokers.com/I do not have an account with them but they are often mentioned in various postings.,0,0.508,0.897,NEGATIVE

It's SIPC coverage and it's up to the Federal Government not the broker.Edit: I believe it's $500,000 for a couple per broker and it's not based on residency. Also, if they sweep your cash to banks, you will get coverage for every partner bank as well.",2,0.536,0.969,NEGATIVE
