,"Seems to me they are incredibly risky yet they are seen as no brainers around here. What if FB releases ""whatsapp pay""? Maybe im missing something","The fact that people continue to act like Visa and MasterCards networks are nothing and something someone can replicate tomorrow, not to mention the regulatory concerns (as one can see when Facebook got bitchslapped by the government when they announced libra, somehow thinking the government would be okay with that) is baffling. Apple pay? You use your credit card. Apple card? Uses the MasterCard Network. No tech company wants to be a financial company and have the regulatory scrutiny that comes with that. For years now, endless things of, ""Won't Apple Pay just wipe out Visa?"" Sigh, no. Won't Google do something? You mean like Google Pay which uses your credit card? Facebook was entitled enough or oblivious enough or a mixture of both to think that creating a competing digital currency that would be located in a foreign country wouldn't bring down the full force of regulators (who were already pissed off at them.) Facebook: ""I mean, we already have a DOJ investigation, what would making a competing currency do?"" Regulators strongly hinted to members of the Libra association that they would best consider leaving said association.There was a great speech by former Visa CEO Charlie scharf about PayPal in spring of 2016:""And so, anyone that's trying to take your customers and disintermediate you is not a friend. And so, that's the reality of the way we viewed PayPal historically. And so, we've said, listen, historically, they were the only game in town. But as we just talked about, there are lots of other opportunities for us to capture that share.We'd love to figure out a different model with them where it's consumer choice first whether or not disintermediating. If we can figure that out with them, great. We'll think of them more as a partner. They need to do things differently in order to do that.The other door is where we go full steam and compete with them in ways that people have never seen before. Because you've never seen us go target PayPal in the marketplace in any meaningful way..""Two months later, PayPal signed a partnership deal with Visa.",0,0.536,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Seems to me they are incredibly risky yet they are seen as no brainers around here. What if FB releases ""whatsapp pay""? Maybe im missing something","This^ all of it.There are three additional things with this from my understanding.Visa and MasterCard, along with the others (banks and cc companies), have built the banking network where all the banking info is processed. This network is highly regulated and locked down. Would someone really want a company like Facebook to have access to that?Visa and MasterCard, along with the others (banks and cc companies) issues credit. Again this is another highly regulated area.PCI compliance. There are so many requirements to the PCI compliance, that I don’t even understand it. Along with understanding it, it is a moving target that changes constantly as more regulation and requirements are applied. PCI is the HIPPA of the banking industry.",1,0.526,0.999,NEGATIVE

,"Seems to me they are incredibly risky yet they are seen as no brainers around here. What if FB releases ""whatsapp pay""? Maybe im missing something","You would likely have to connect that app to your bank via a credit card. In many parts of the world the only cards you can really use is a visa or MasterCard. It’s also pretty hard to create a credit card system, that is better and cheaper then the one already being used, and then convince everyone to use it, and then do it all at the same time. People don’t want a payment system they can’t use everywhere, and they only want to pay for one, so it is not really a market you can “invade” and compete in.",0,0.531,0.978,NEGATIVE

It’s an oligarchy.China didn’t get the same environment because in the early days getting a credit card was difficult, this allowed Alipay and Wechat pay to thrive, they both link to bank accounts and can top-up using credit cards.
