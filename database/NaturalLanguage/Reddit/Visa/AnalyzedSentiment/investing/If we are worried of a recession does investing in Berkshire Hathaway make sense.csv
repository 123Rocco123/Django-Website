,"Hey guys, I just started working a good job in June and have been saving up money and wanted to invest. I have about $5,000 in cash and am looking to invest most of it but obviously all the talks of a recession or big correction have me stalling. From what I understand BRK has 128B in cash and if a recession were to hit they would make out really well by buying undervalued businesses. Would investing in them then be a good hedge? I was thinking of putting a majority of my portfolio in BRK and then having a few others like AMD, Visa, Microsoft etc. If a recession hits then I continue to average down on my other positions and hope BRK benefits. Does this make sense or am I misunderstanding something? I think sitting on the sidelines hoping for a crash isnt the best play and I think this strategy would be a good compromise.

I was thinking of putting a majority of my portfolio in BRK and then having a few others like AMD, Visa, Microsoft etc. If a recession hits then I continue to average down on my other positions and hope BRK benefits. Does this make sense or am I misunderstanding something? I think sitting on the sidelines hoping for a crash isnt the best play and I think this strategy would be a good compromise.
