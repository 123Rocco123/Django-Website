,I sold my Visa position at some point to make room for something else. I'm looking to get back in as I think it's one of the most viable long term holds but I'm unsure of a decent entry point as I've not been keeping track of the stock. I know it's been kicking butt lately but that's about it. Any advice/factors to consider?,"Wait for this FANG bubble to pop or at least deflate a little then. V won't be one of the prime culprits, but there could be collateral damage. I'm holding mine, I intend to still be holding V 20 years from now, but I'm very open to the possibility that it could get rocky in the tech sector here in the short run.",0,0.544,0.878,NEGATIVE

I know it's been kicking butt lately but that's about it. Any advice/factors to consider?,"Don’t try to time it if you are thinking that it is one of the most viable long term holds out there. You could wait a couple of days and maybe it goes down a few bucks, or maybe it goes up a few dollars, but if you keep trying to time it and never actually invest, you’re probably going to regret it in a year or two. I’ve been long Visa since it IPO’d, and since then I’ve added to my position. I usually waited until it was off its high before buying more, but I never tried to time it hoping that it’s downturn was done. In the long term, the few dollars won’t matter much.",0,0.536,0.999,NEGATIVE

If you’re looking only for Visa, you could sell puts and collect the premiums to offset purchasing Visa.
