,"I have a bit of Visa stock, and I’m also looking into MasterCard and Discover. They all offer dividends of varying amounts. My instinct is to go with Discover, because lower stock price = more shares = more dividend payouts. Is this the best way to go, or is my thinking too simplistic? I am admittedly a newb when it comes to dividend stocks.",6% dividend on $1000 is still just $60. It doesn’t matter how many stocks you own,0,0.529,1.0,NEGATIVE

Good luck hunting! I own Visa and think it’s the best one long term. But more transactions are happening in the tech sector via peer to peer so you may want to look at companies with P2P payment options. (Very few if any of them pay dividends though),0,0.524,0.997,NEGATIVE

Obviously the stock price will go up if the company has been performing well.",2,0.667,0.998,NEGATIVE

I am admittedly a newb when it comes to dividend stocks.",No. The dividend amount is increased if management decides to increase it. What happens is that the dividend yield on your principle fluctuates up and down with the stock price.A stock is valued at 100 dollars per share and pays 1 dollar per share annually making it a 1% yield. if your stock doubles in price but the dividend remains the same then you have 200 dollars in equity but are only getting .5% paid out in dividendsI would suggest that you look into some low cost broad index funds before you start picking stocks.,2,0.575,1.0,NEGATIVE

Check the info collected on the U.S. Dividend Champion spreadsheet posted here (top of the left column): https://www.dripinvesting.org/Tools/Tools.asp and look at dividend growth rates as well.",0,0.521,0.574,POSITIVE

I am admittedly a newb when it comes to dividend stocks.","What you should be comparing is the dividend yield. Mastercard has a dividend yield of 0.48% vs Discover’s 2.3%. This means for every $100 invested in MA, you get $0.48 in dividends and $2.30 for MA and DFS respectively. But I wouldn’t be too concerned about dividends because the capital gains/losses can dwarf the dividends. MA has higher growth potential in my opinion. DFS is down more than 10% YTD while MA is up 10%.",0,0.521,0.965,NEGATIVE
