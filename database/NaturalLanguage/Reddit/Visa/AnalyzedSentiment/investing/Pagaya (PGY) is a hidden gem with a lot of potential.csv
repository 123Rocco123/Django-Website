,"I own Pagaya $PGY and plan to keep buying up to $1.30 to $1.40. I believe there is tremendous upside left in the stock. These are my reasons to buy: Pick and Shovel Play : Pagaya is a Fintech, pick and shovels, AI play providing a platform/software service to commercial lenders like Visa, banks, and even Fintech competitor SoFi Technologies (SOFI). It has an excellent de-risking AI business model at scale for lenders and investors. Low Credit Risk: Pagaya doesn’t keep any loans on its books, except a small percentage of securitizations made by them for mandatory risk retention compliance. Recurring Fee Based Business: It charges fees to business clients (lenders) like Visa (V), Ally Financial (ALLY) and SoFi Technologies to provide due diligence and credit analysis of their potential borrowers - sift through their initially-declined loan applications, and find any good loans among the declined ones. Network Model: Pagaya bundles these loans and moves them to their final destination - investors. 80% of the loans get bundled into ABS, (Asset Backed Securities), which institutional clients have agreed to purchase in advance. The other 20% of the bundled loans are sold to private investors, and Pagaya charges them a fee for that service Switching Costs: It takes Pagaya and the lender about 2-3 years to complete onboarding and integration. Clients are likely to remain loyal. It has strong capital and institutional Backing: The Singapore Government Fund, which owns 9% of Pagaya is also a large buyer of ABS. Strong pipeline: Pagaya has a large and very credible pipeline, a unique business model, which de-risks the lending business in real time and a platform that works across several products and lenders. Challenges, weaknesses and threats Cyclical: This is a Cutthroat, Commodity, Cyclical business and sure there is the AI product differentiator, but over time, even M/L or AI platforms or software will become a commoditized business, without significant competitive advantages. Network volume flatlined in Q1-2022, at 1.6Bn, then stagnated at $1.9Bn in two quarters of 2022, with even one decrease to $1.8Bn. We finally saw growth renewing in Q1-2023 to $1.9Bn. Barriers to entry are low: For example, their lender customers could easily develop the same software. Their lenders who are much bigger, SoFi Technologies itself is $7.5Bn in market cap, a little less than 10 times Pagaya's size, -- could become their biggest competitors by investing in similar AI software for themselves, eliminate Pagaya and shop their own product around like AWS. Dilution: Another challenge is the possibility of continued dilution. Share count stood at 738Mn shares in Sep 2023 compared to 667Mn in Sep 2022, an increase of 11%... Valuation Pagaya is priced at only 1.05 times sales and with an estimated Sales CAGR of 22%, this drops to 0.6x sales - it had current assets of $419Mn in Sep 2023- that’s about half its market cap of $855Mn ! That's a steal! Compare that to SoFi, which is priced at 3.7X sales and has a 3 year forward CAGR of 19% lower than Pagaya. Plus, SoFi earns only a part of its revenues from services, they earn interest income as well, which carries credit risk. They will soon be listed in the US - that itself could be a huge boost. And can also benefit from a reverse stock split, which removes the cheaper branding of a $1 stock. Sure there are risks, but I believe most of them are already priced in at a low price of $1.13, and the upside could easily be $4 to $5 in a few years.",Man!

Here are my takeaways.I attended the meeting -- It was interesting and some questions were answered, which is kind of normal for these meetings.Guidance is reaffirmed for Q1-24 and full year 2024, which is about $170Mn in adjusted EBITDA.Pagaya will be operating cash flow positive in early 2025 - reaffirmed. This was given with enough specifics, there will be enough margins from credit lending to tide over retention requirements.In my opinion, there was a certain amount of naïveté about getting a good deal from Wall Street for the recent capital raise. Wall Street rarely overpays and Blackrock, likely never does. And as the market was driven down, two other institutions besides Blackrock, who were part of the raise also bargained much lower than the original price.In terms of risk - 2021-mid 2022 vintages had weaker loans than 2023 and the current cohort, but management again reiterated that this was significantly lower than the rest of the market. I suspect that this weakness was well taken advantage of by the investors in the current capital raise.In securitization even though the issuer has to retain only 5% for compliance, the performance of the loans matters a lot because the underwriter/ABS buyer will not come back to you if you keep piling on bad loans, and because securitizations work in tranches - the top tranche has the best loans and so on… the weaker tranches cannot afford to have too many delinquent loans. In which case the issuer will have to take up that slack or discount it to just to stay in business. The general impression I got was that some of the 2021 vintage was slow to be taken off the books at a decent price.Bottom line - I’m staying invested, the re-affirmation of guidance for 2024 is good, and I would like to think management will be a lot more forthcoming after this.",1,0.523,NEGATIVE,0.92

That's a steal! Compare that to SoFi, which is priced at 3.7X sales and has a 3 year forward CAGR of 19% lower than Pagaya.

It has an excellent de-risking AI business model at scale for lenders and investors. Low Credit Risk: Pagaya doesn’t keep any loans on its books, except a small percentage of securitizations made by them for mandatory risk retention compliance. Recurring Fee Based Business: It charges fees to business clients (lenders) like Visa (V), Ally Financial (ALLY) and SoFi Technologies to provide due diligence and credit analysis of their potential borrowers - sift through their initially-declined loan applications, and find any good loans among the declined ones. Network Model: Pagaya bundles these loans and moves them to their final destination - investors. 80% of the loans get bundled into ABS, (Asset Backed Securities), which institutional clients have agreed to purchase in advance. The other 20% of the bundled loans are sold to private investors, and Pagaya charges them a fee for that service Switching Costs: It takes Pagaya and the lender about 2-3 years to complete onboarding and integration. Clients are likely to remain loyal. It has strong capital and institutional Backing: The Singapore Government Fund, which owns 9% of Pagaya is also a large buyer of ABS. Strong pipeline: Pagaya has a large and very credible pipeline, a unique business model, which de-risks the lending business in real time and a platform that works across several products and lenders. Challenges, weaknesses and threats Cyclical: This is a Cutthroat, Commodity, Cyclical business and sure there is the AI product differentiator, but over time, even M/L or AI platforms or software will become a commoditized business, without significant competitive advantages. Network volume flatlined in Q1-2022, at 1.6Bn, then stagnated at $1.9Bn in two quarters of 2022, with even one decrease to $1.8Bn. We finally saw growth renewing in Q1-2023 to $1.9Bn. Barriers to entry are low: For example, their lender customers could easily develop the same software. Their lenders who are much bigger, SoFi Technologies itself is $7.5Bn in market cap, a little less than 10 times Pagaya's size, -- could become their biggest competitors by investing in similar AI software for themselves, eliminate Pagaya and shop their own product around like AWS. Dilution: Another challenge is the possibility of continued dilution. Share count stood at 738Mn shares in Sep 2023 compared to 667Mn in Sep 2022, an increase of 11%... Valuation Pagaya is priced at only 1.05 times sales and with an estimated Sales CAGR of 22%, this drops to 0.6x sales - it had current assets of $419Mn in Sep 2023- that’s about half its market cap of $855Mn ! That's a steal! Compare that to SoFi, which is priced at 3.7X sales and has a 3 year forward CAGR of 19% lower than Pagaya. Plus, SoFi earns only a part of its revenues from services, they earn interest income as well, which carries credit risk. They will soon be listed in the US - that itself could be a huge boost. And can also benefit from a reverse stock split, which removes the cheaper branding of a $1 stock. Sure there are risks, but I believe most of them are already priced in at a low price of $1.13, and the upside could easily be $4 to $5 in a few years.",Pagaya is looking to enter Russell.
