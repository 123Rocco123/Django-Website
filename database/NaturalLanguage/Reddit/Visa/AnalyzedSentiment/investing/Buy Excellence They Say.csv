,"Which companies do you regard as excellent? McDonalds? Visa? Berkshire, Brookfield? Ferrari? Apple? So many excellent seeming companies out there, but which do you consider excellent?","Consider “excellence” with respect to peers as well as industry. Just because you have the best department store 10 years ago doesn’t mean they will be excellent in the future, you have to understand the industry as well as the competition. Just picking the popular companies now doesn’t equate to “excellence.”Excellence 10 years ago was petrochina(negative), Exxon(+3%/yr), Walmart(+11%/yr), and Johnson & Johnson(+11%/yr); vs SP500 +13%/yr.Excellence 20 years ago would have been Microsoft(+7%/yr), GE(negative), Cisco(+3%/yr), Exxon(+6%/yr), and Walmart(+6%/yr); vs SP500 +6%/yr.",0,0.523,0.948,POSITIVE
