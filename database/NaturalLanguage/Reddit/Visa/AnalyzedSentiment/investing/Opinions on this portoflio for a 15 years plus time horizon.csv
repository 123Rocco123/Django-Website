I'm bulish on tech so QQQ seems fine to me. I might even add 5% individual semi companies that don't have a big % in QQQ like TSM and ASML(because they have a low % in QQQ).

Long-term underperformance is a very real risk with a position like that.  If you had put $10,000 in QQQ the day it launched in March 1999, it would have… underperformed $10,000 put in the S&P 500 until June 2020. That’s 21 years of lagging the market. It then fell harder than the S&P in March 2022, and didn’t catch back up until May 2023.been worth less than $10,000 until November 2013–over 14 years to have any gains adjust that for inflation, and you wouldn’t have gotten out of the red in terms of actual purchasing power until December 2016 A 15 year time horizon doesn’t make the risk of a highly concentrated portfolio go away.Edit: even today, after the crazy returns that have everyone so excited, your $10k QQQ investment is only worth 5% more than a $10k investment in the S&P 500 ($56,267 vs $53,216).",0,0.529,NEGATIVE,1.0

If we’d asked that same question in 2012, the answer would have been equally obvious the other way.   My point with all this isn’t necessarily “don’t buy QQQ.” My point is that with a portfolio that’s concentrated in a larger smaller (oops) number of stocks, especially in the same sector, there’s a very real risk of making less money over a 10 or even 20 year period. There’s also a chance that you outperform, like you have, so maybe you decide it’s worth taking that risk.   My response was prompted by OP’s assertion that they weren’t worried about risk because they have a 15 year time horizon. The risk of a concentrated portfolio is more than just short-term volatility. That’s my point.  Edit: said another way—many folks around here seem to think that the proposition with something like QQQ is “it’ll be a bumpier ride, but I’m guaranteed to end up with more money,” when in fact the proposition is “I’m taking the risk that I’ll end up with less money in exchange for the possibility of ending up with more.”",2,0.537,NEGATIVE,0.999

I think it was the NASDAQ. And that’s a big holy shit. I lived through that bubble, and it’s long enough ago that I can brag about living through it.I’m not slamming what you’re saying, but you’re literally talking about one event and then you’re making generalizations about it like it’s a semi-common occurrence. It’s one event that happened. It can happen again. But it was such an enormous, earth shattering set of circumstances, that it’s really hard to prepare for that stuff.Like I’m not sure what happened on the day after Pearl Harbor, but I suppose it was pretty big. But you can’t be baking Pearl HarborS into your risk analysis because you’re setting your tolerance so low that you wouldn’t be able to invest in anything except maybe gold. And of course there have been Numerous attempts to corner gold. Last time might’ve been in the 1800s, but we’re apparently not excluding anything.",1,0.514,NEGATIVE,1.0

But it was such an enormous, earth shattering set of circumstances, that it’s really hard to prepare for that stuff.In some sense yes, but in a very real way you can prepare for that stuff, which is exactly my point. A concentrated portfolio is much more vulnerable to those big tail risk events, and you can really reduce that vulnerability with a well-diversified portfolio. A total stock market index fund was also hurt by the crash, but it didn’t draw down nearly as far, and it bounced back much more quickly, because it’s more diversified.",2,0.522,NEGATIVE,1.0
