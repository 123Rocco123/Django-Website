,"I've been re-reading the Berkshire annual letters recently, specifically the ones during the late '70s and early '80s when US inflation raged at 10-14%. During this time Buffett talked extensively about investing in an inflationary environment and I'd like to share three tenets that I picked out. Inflation tenet 1: Pricing power In the 1980 letter, Buffett talks about how the best businesses to own are ones that have true pricing power. He calls these businesses ""indexed"" to inflation because they can raise the prices of their goods and services in line with the costs of producing them without impacting consumer demand or impacting its margins: ""For capital to be truly indexed, return on equity must rise, i.e., business earnings consistently must increase in proportion to the increase in the price level without any need for the business to add to capital - including working capital - employed."" The best way to increase earnings without increasing capital employed is to raise prices, but this requires pricing power. A business can achieve pricing power is by having a durable, intrinsic competitive advantage, or a 'moat' in Buffett speak. Moats come in many forms, for example brands like Apple or Coca Cola, a 'switching moat' like Automatic Data Processing, or scaling efficiencies like Costco. Inflation tenet 2: High returns on equity Inflation should be considered a 'hurdle rate' which all businesses must surpass in the form of return on equity. This bar has been set incredibly low in the last couple of decades it has allowed many businesses to survive that perhaps should not have. Here is Buffett's chilling analogy from the 1981 letter: ""...inflation acts as a gigantic corporate tapeworm. That tapeworm pre-emptively consumes its requisite daily diet of investment dollars regardless of the health of the host organism. Whatever the level of reported profits (even if nil), more dollars for receivables, inventory and fixed assets are continuously required by the business in order to merely match the unit volume of the previous year. The less prosperous the enterprise, the greater the proportion of available sustenance claimed by the tapeworm."" ""Under present conditions, a business earning 8% or 10% on equity often has no leftovers for expansion, debt reduction or “real” dividends. The tapeworm of inflation simply cleans the plate."" Investors would also do well to avoid companies with high debt with have the illusionary effect of juicing ROE numbers. Companies that rely on revolving credit are at the whim of rising interest rates. Inflation tenet 3: Capable of large business volume increases Again in the 1981 letter, Buffett recommends that the business needs to be able to ""accommodate large dollar volume increases in business (often produced more by inflation than by real growth) with only minor additional investment of capital"". When businesses can increase output without increasing the cost of output at the same rate, this is called operational leverage. Examples of businesses that can more easily scale up demand are software businesses like Microsoft, or payment processors like Visa. Summary Some businesses have intrinsic characteristics that make them more resilient to inflationary pressures. Investors would do well to identify some businesses that fit the profiles that Buffett has drawn us and try and own them (at a sensible price), for what may well be a sustained high inflation environment in the decade to come.",Good luck finding said companies for cheap .They got found already,0,0.614,0.969,NEGATIVE

,"I've been re-reading the Berkshire annual letters recently, specifically the ones during the late '70s and early '80s when US inflation raged at 10-14%. During this time Buffett talked extensively about investing in an inflationary environment and I'd like to share three tenets that I picked out. Inflation tenet 1: Pricing power In the 1980 letter, Buffett talks about how the best businesses to own are ones that have true pricing power. He calls these businesses ""indexed"" to inflation because they can raise the prices of their goods and services in line with the costs of producing them without impacting consumer demand or impacting its margins: ""For capital to be truly indexed, return on equity must rise, i.e., business earnings consistently must increase in proportion to the increase in the price level without any need for the business to add to capital - including working capital - employed."" The best way to increase earnings without increasing capital employed is to raise prices, but this requires pricing power. A business can achieve pricing power is by having a durable, intrinsic competitive advantage, or a 'moat' in Buffett speak. Moats come in many forms, for example brands like Apple or Coca Cola, a 'switching moat' like Automatic Data Processing, or scaling efficiencies like Costco.

,"I've been re-reading the Berkshire annual letters recently, specifically the ones during the late '70s and early '80s when US inflation raged at 10-14%. During this time Buffett talked extensively about investing in an inflationary environment and I'd like to share three tenets that I picked out. Inflation tenet 1: Pricing power In the 1980 letter, Buffett talks about how the best businesses to own are ones that have true pricing power. He calls these businesses ""indexed"" to inflation because they can raise the prices of their goods and services in line with the costs of producing them without impacting consumer demand or impacting its margins: ""For capital to be truly indexed, return on equity must rise, i.e., business earnings consistently must increase in proportion to the increase in the price level without any need for the business to add to capital - including working capital - employed."" The best way to increase earnings without increasing capital employed is to raise prices, but this requires pricing power. A business can achieve pricing power is by having a durable, intrinsic competitive advantage, or a 'moat' in Buffett speak. Moats come in many forms, for example brands like Apple or Coca Cola, a 'switching moat' like Automatic Data Processing, or scaling efficiencies like Costco. Inflation tenet 2: High returns on equity Inflation should be considered a 'hurdle rate' which all businesses must surpass in the form of return on equity. This bar has been set incredibly low in the last couple of decades it has allowed many businesses to survive that perhaps should not have. Here is Buffett's chilling analogy from the 1981 letter: ""...inflation acts as a gigantic corporate tapeworm. That tapeworm pre-emptively consumes its requisite daily diet of investment dollars regardless of the health of the host organism. Whatever the level of reported profits (even if nil), more dollars for receivables, inventory and fixed assets are continuously required by the business in order to merely match the unit volume of the previous year. The less prosperous the enterprise, the greater the proportion of available sustenance claimed by the tapeworm."" ""Under present conditions, a business earning 8% or 10% on equity often has no leftovers for expansion, debt reduction or “real” dividends. The tapeworm of inflation simply cleans the plate."" Investors would also do well to avoid companies with high debt with have the illusionary effect of juicing ROE numbers.

Its a lot easier to find a good investment oportunity for 1 million dollars than for 1 billion dollars.
