,"I invested in both Visa and Mastecard and they have done great so far! I would love to put more money into the two companies because I think that we are most certainly moving towards a cashless economy, slowly but surely.

Very regulated industry that's hard for competition to break into, and their lobbyists will have major input on any new regulations. Possibly they'll write the new regulations. They may or may not take over the world, but it's a strong likelihood that they'll continue to control the portion of the world that they currently control.If I were going to put my whole portfolio into one stock it would be V",0,0.551,0.998,NEGATIVE

The real value of MasterCard and Visa is their payment processing network, and the two of them have a virtually unassailable lead. I like MasterCard more because it has a more advanced international operation, its financial metrics are stronger, and Ajay Banga is a great CEO, but it would be hard to go wrong with either.The only thing that really puts me off about either is that their valuations have really grown as people have embraced the idea of a cashless economy, but I think the premium is deserved.",0,0.524,0.818,POSITIVE

If you use Paypal's wallet to do your spending/money movement, then that's bad for the networks because you didn't use a card. However, the best approach is to go with the flow and try to capture as much of that pie through partnership models -- with Paypal offering their digital wallet AND card options. Let the consumer decide how they prefer to pay or get paid. just make sure they have all of the options available.I disagree with the notion that Mastercard has a more advanced international operation. They saw more growth on cross-border last quarter from a % metric-- but you need to remember that MC started with smaller cross border volumes to begin with, so it's a lot easier to post higher % growth (Visa cross border volumes also grew last quarter).Lastly, you might want to take another look at the financial metrics. Who has higher net profit margin? Visa. But, who has higher PE? MC. MC definitely has good top line growth upside, but you will be paying a premium for that.",1,0.537,0.937,NEGATIVE

But lets be clear, when I use the word ""safe"", I am really meaning ""low risk"". Yes I consider Visa and MasterCard a good investment for the long-term.
