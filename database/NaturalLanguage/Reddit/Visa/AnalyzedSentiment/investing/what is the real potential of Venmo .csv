,Can Venmo be the biggest asset for PYPL going forward? The other day I was reading an article stating that Venmo hasn't yet hit 10% of it's potential userbase/potemtial and it can be a perfect alternative to blockchain for all the platforms(Facebook.. sort of) are looking for mobile payments. what you guys feel. PYPL or VISA/MASTER ?,"On the UK Venmo is utterly useless. We have faster payments, so paying someone is instant. On top of that we have challenger banks like Monzo and Starling, that let you do everything bank related through an app. With added features like money management and budgeting.The us has always been behind in this sector but surely they'll get it too at some point.Maybe Venmo can pivot to a bank. Otherwise I don't see it's potential. Why use Venmo when my bank has the same thing? There's so many different ways to pay people now too.",0,0.515,1.0,NEGATIVE

They are more than just mobile payments, they have their own POS system, which is a huge market, and one where tech needs to be updated, so they're in a good position.I don't see Square here either, but that's kind of my point, because we already have the payments part nailed. At least Square have another side to their business. In the UK iZettle are far more popular, I see them everywhere, little handheld card machines, plus they're working on a POS too. I like what iZettle are doing, but they're not a public company yet so can't invest. They will be soon.",2,0.546,0.737,POSITIVE

PYPL or VISA/MASTER ?,"I’m a fan on PayPal stock. It’s currently, and has been, the most used online/mobile payment method. I think it will continue this trend for the foreseeable future. Venmo is also currently the largest P2P payment method and its user base is obviously growing like crazy.PayPal has been focused on growth ever since the split from eBay and it’s been exceeding expectations ever since. I believe they will do whatever it takes to remain on top of the online/mobile payments. If that eventually requires them to incorporate blockchain technology then I’d assume they would do just that.With that said, I’m also a fan of Visa and MasterCard although I’m not as knowledgeable about them as PayPal. I do know that Visa has more than 50% of market share, don’t quote me but I think it’s in the 60s or more actually.I actually created a post about PayPal before there most recent earnings call that has some interesting comments.https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/8ez1ho/paypal_pypl_earnings_and_future_outlook_discussion/?st=JGYJK0K9&sh=06f10e2f",0,0.545,0.782,POSITIVE

PYPL or VISA/MASTER ?,"FWIW I think Venmo has huge untapped potential. I don't know of anyone over the age of 35 who uses it right now--they are all still writing physical checks and mailing them to each other. I find it infinitely preferable to blockchain since I can use it to make instant transactions that are carried out and secured by my bank in the currency I pay taxes with.I don't think it's really competing in the same space as Visa or Mastercard, which are more focused on commercial rather than peer-to-peer clients.",0,0.511,0.948,POSITIVE
