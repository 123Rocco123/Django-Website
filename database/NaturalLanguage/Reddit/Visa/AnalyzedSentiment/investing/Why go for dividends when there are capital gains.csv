V has a low yield but high growth. I own both.I own dividend stocks because it makes it easier to hold things like SHOP, AMZN, PAYC, NFLX, GOOGL, NVDA (negligible dividend but I’ll take it). The dividends pay my living expense and the non-payers just sit in my portfolio and get bigger. All my stocks have a job, though not the same exact function.Would I have been better off with a portfolio of 100% SHOP calls? YOLO FTW? That would have done even better than QQQ, VUG, MCD or V, right? Well yeah, but I want to preserve my wealth as well as grow it. I also want to preserve my sanity. I want to sleep well at night, most nights. If I doubled my net worth tomorrow it would not have a dramatic effect on my life, but if I lost it all I’d be ruined. I’m too old for that shit.So it all depends on your goals and life circumstances too. If you’re young and in accumulation mode, go for capital gains. Dividends literally do not matter to you; total return is all. If you’re old and in withdrawal mode, dividends have a place (so do bonds). Chasing yield rarely ends well though.",0,0.526,0.989,POSITIVE

Meanwhile, the best dividend stocks and ETFs their prices are nearly stable and provide 5-7% dividend So why go for the 5-7% returns when you have 15-20% returns?","A number of reasons, but for me there's two main ones:I'm not an active trader. I dollar cost average every month in mostly high dividend yielding stocks and because they're companies I believe in for long term growth AND I get a juicy dividend, I don't feel the need to constantly check their performance. I'm more than happy for some stocks to take a little longer to recover this year, because while I wait, I'm still getting paid.Dividends boost returns when times are good and minimise overall losses when they're not. If two stocks fall 10% and one has a dividend of 5% and the other doesn't, then it's a little less painful having that dividend money in your pocket.Your question is parallel to ""why would someone in sales take a $35,000 salary with a little commission over a purely 100% commission based sales job and potentially earn $70,000"". Some people are happy taking the salary option because it's more steady and when times are bad, they're still getting paid. Some people would rather take the 100% commission route and so when times are good, they're very good, however when times are bad, they're very bad.",0,0.548,0.531,NEGATIVE

With DRIP compounding you are getting actual shares of the company. This is something that is material that will lead to further growth of actual shares so long as the dividend does not get suspended.Obviously we saw a lot of dividend stocks cut or suspend their dividend recently, but most will eventually bring them back if their business recovers and they escape bankruptcy.With that said, I invest mainly for growth, but I do have some dividend stocks in the portfolio that will hopefully still be around and paying a dividend 40-50 years from now.

Everyone must do what is best for them. So, here are my thoughts, my mindset, and overall philosophy on why I choose to go the dividend route:I mainly invest for cashflow/dividends. Although capital appreciation is nice, I do NOT really care that much because I do NOT intend on selling. With that said, this does not mean that I do not care at all because capital appreciation is a quick and dirty metric for a company's performance. One day, my dividend payments, cashflow from stocks, passive income from stocks, or however you want to articulate it, will pay for ALL of my living expenses;Since I intend on holding forever, I must choose WELL-ESTABLISHED, HIGH-QUALITY, BLUE-CHIP, DIVIDEND PAYING companies with WIDE ECONOMIC MOATS because there is always a risk when it comes to investing. The main benefit of holding forever (in my opinion) is that it allows for greater compounding. Additionally, when I give this to my children, they will have an additional annual salary of approximately $50,000/year (if not more). However, I sincerely hope that they do NOT take this supplemental salary from the dividends and simply allow it to compound even more until they retire. I also hope that this cycle repeats into perpetuity;Since I am not an ""intelligent"" person, I do not ""daytrade"", I do not ""buy low, sell high"", I do not play with ""penny stocks"", and I do not try to ""time the market"". I am a ""dividend growth investor for the SUPER long-term"" (which will be explained and defined in point #6);I am happy in times of recession/depression since it allows me to buy more shit on sale and LOCK-IN those FUTURE YIELDS ON COST as I have a stable income and a very secure job as a military officer;I don't give a fuck about what my friends think, what other people think, and/or what the professionals think. You shouldn't either. I have a game plan that works for me, that works for my psychological well-being, and I will ride with it until I die;People often say that they are long-term investors (i.e. 10-25 years). I am different. I am a SUPER long-term investor. I intend for my portfolio to carry onward for 75-150 years. With that said, I understand that times will change; and therefore, the portfolio must be adjusted/fluid. This will be the responsibility of my future children and my future grandchildren; andFinally, it is often said that the first $1,000,000 is the most difficult to secure. Going from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 is easier. But, the easiest is $5,000,000 to $10,000,000. My overall intent is to be the guy who fucking sets it all up, educates the next generation, and secure generational wealth for my last name.That is why I choose dividend investing. Good luck on your journey and I hope that you find something that works for YOU! =)#thuglifedividendgrowthinvesting",0,0.54,0.997,NEGATIVE
