,"I’ve already invested, too, so is all my money just going to waste :/ that’s what is sounds like...","Because your Roth IRA is no longer valid after you receive an international paycheck.What are you basing this on?The rules as I understand them are that you need income in the US to contribute to a Roth. If you haven't paid taxes on $6k to the IRS then you can't put $6k into the Roth. Expat earning under $100k a year typically exclude all of their income using FEIE which makes them ineligible to contribute to IRAs.HR Block says:If you exclude all of your income and have no other sources of earned income, you are not eligible to contribute to an IRA. However, if you only exclude part of your income, or claim the foreign tax credit instead, you may still be able to contribute to an IRA.",0,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE
