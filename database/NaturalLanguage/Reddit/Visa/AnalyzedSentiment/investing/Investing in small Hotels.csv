,"Hi All, First post here and sorry if this is not the right sub for investments other than stock market. A friend of a friend is building a small hotel/tiny resort (10-15 rooms/small houses) with a pool and activities in and around rural Crete, Greece and is open to investors. I’m from one of the APAC countries and am interested in investing in it ($100k-500k) but not what investment options should I consider. I’m not interested in Visa (Golden Visa) or right to live in Greece, I just want to own something in a European country, something I can pass onto my children. Questions: What are the typical investment options when investing in small hotels? (Owning shares, % of revenue/profit, owning right to holiday whenever, timeshare etc what am I missing?) Is anyone aware of any regulations or requirements for anyone from APAC investing in European Economic Zone? Do you think it’s a good idea? Yes, why? No, why? Thank you so much! Edit: the hotel would be run by the that friend of a friend and I know them very well. Very reliable and they have run Airbnb successfully for many years.","Who is managing the property and how well do you know them? A hotel/resorts success depends on the staff and management.You can run a 5 star hotel into the ground with the wrong staff.I wouldn’t invest unless I met all the staff involved. It’s a highly personable business, you’re not building things or investing in a mining operation.",0,0.517,0.991,NEGATIVE

You will likely need both an attorney and an accountant before you will even know if you are able to do thishotels are notoriously difficult to runyour friend doesn’t have relevant experience (no running airbnbs is not anything like running a hotel)this is a friend and going into business with friends is generally a bad ideathe hotel seems to be “in the middle of everything”. And usually that means “not near anything”. People are generally going to pull up maps of hotels of where they want to stay, not 30 minutes away. This can be overcome with marketing, but it’d be better if it was a large facility that could spread that cost over a multitude of rooms.All I see is red flags. What’s the upside you are seeing here?
