This would lead a huge gap in about a year. Healthcare will hopefully be left alone, but IT and lab work is heavily dependent on H1b workers from India and China.Honestly it‚Äôs incredibly short sighted an idea. The thought that Americans are ‚Äúlosing jobs to foreigners‚Äù is literally ridiculous. By definition, H1b visa holders must be paid the prevailing wage (aka no, the foreigners aren‚Äôt being paid less to steal the job) and by definition, an H1b job can‚Äôt be given if a qualified US applicant applies. So, basically it means there are lots of important jobs out there that literally no one in America can fill.What happens to all these pharmaceutical companies when their grad students leave? Innovation grinds to a halt.If anything, this may continue to exacerbate tensions between China and the US, so perhaps will fuel further thoughts that the next step will be delisting of Chinese companies. May see some drops there.Source: I was on an H1b for 4 years, now on an O1 (from Canada)",0,0.522,1.0,NEGATIVE

The ‚Äúprevailing wage‚Äù thing is not entirely true - there are plenty of companies working around those rules and paying much less. H1B is archaic and is in bad need of reform.Also innovation will be just fine - companies have international presence so they‚Äôll just start hiring in places where government does not create problems for them. I‚Äôve seen a bunch of these dynamics during the last tensions around H1B. I‚Äôve also seen similar thing play out when big-company-name I worked for started having troubles with their big office in China. Office was just shut down, most talented people were supplied with visas and moved out.What the ‚Äúforeigners stealing our jobs‚Äù crowd doesn‚Äôt get is that whether they like it or not - these educated foreigners exist and will compete for jobs now.
