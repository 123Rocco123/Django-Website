,An expansion into entertainment/festivals has not been successful as margins have been very tight and 2017 was hit by higher costs due to changes in H-2B visa program and hurricane disruption. However the CEO has now been replaced and all businesses are being reviewed with the goal to improve profitable or potentially divest. The core local radio business is much more profitable operating at a local level rather than competing with nation advertisers. Operating margins c.30%. The stock price has almost halved since 2015 even though revenue and earnings have grown strongly making the current valuation look very cheap. This post is not a recommendation to buy or sell any security or derivative. Stocks are not suitable for all investors. Please do your own research. Good article in seeking alpha by Ty Collin,"I worked for this company for three years back in the early 2000s. I invested my time in them, and that was more than enough. I wouldn't put a dollar of my own money in.",0,0.572,0.984,POSITIVE

Good article in seeking alpha by Ty Collin,"I listen to one of this companies stations in my work vehicle all day long because they do traffic every 15 minutes which is helpful- and it is talk which is better than the same old songs on rotation.That being said- I see a couple things going on. I've been listening to this station for 15+ years-They seem to get a local advertiser such as a plumber, HVAC, Realtor, solar roof company, replacement windows, gutters, etc- someone who has a big enough operation to have some money to spend on advertising to try to keep a fleet of guys working so are willing to try a package to play ads for a few months.They then proceed to play the same ad over and over and over until you HATE whatever company the ad is for and you shut off the radio or change the channel.After a few months, the contract is up and some new company that meets those requirements comes along..I get it- they are targeting a more casual listener I suppose, but many people have the same commute to work and back every day..Bottom line, for ME anyway- I do not see this as any growth in this segment coming in any way, especially with more options to play your own music or podcasts in a car. This is not something to invest in.",0,0.552,1.0,NEGATIVE
