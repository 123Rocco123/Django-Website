,,"It depends on your risk tolerance. Individual stocks if your risk appetite is higher. ETFs are great if you want to hedge your risks. It's also OK to hold both.However, Visa, MA, and PayPal are all solid choices. PayPal has so much potential to grow as a stock and/or company. Visa and Mastercard are cash cows and have monopolies in the payment processing space, continually beat earnings, and have an upward trend in terms of stock appreciation - personally, I don't see these companies ever going away.",0,0.555,0.996,NEGATIVE
,,Agree here. I have some individual stocks but the bulk of my money is in ETF’s that fit my investment strategy.Also agree on V and MA. They’re the main networks for digital payments in a world that’s increasingly going digital/online. They are as close to monopolies as you can get in their respective sector. Think of them like a toll both. If your a business or a bank your more then likely going to use V/MA as your main payment network and they’re just going to charge a small fee to use it. Now imagine hundreds of millions if not billions of transactions a day and they charge just a few pennies. Boom. Money in the bank. Great companies all around and it’s no wonder they’re almost always trading at a premium.,1,0.531,0.994,POSITIVE

,,"Do you think that PayPals moat is that great, though? Seems like Square could have eaten PayPals lunch already if they had better focus, but OTOH I don't see anything fully penetrating the V/MA moat for a long time.",3,0.518,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"Yea I mean Paypal has a really strong position due to their costumer support and convenience. A lot of people will simply not buy from smaller / lesser known websites unless they accept Paypal due to the huge consumer protection it offers. A few years ago I was working on an online booking platform and although Paypal was by far the most expensive payment method, we just had to include it as it increased conversion rate immensely. Same with ordering from oversea stores (esp in China), if anything goes wrong you know they'll go after the seller. Ofc that makes them a huge annoyance to retailers, but they're so dependent on it that there's no alternative.I don't see them getting into V/MA territory either but online they have their own space. As for square, I live in Europe and didn't even know what that was until you mentioned it.",4,0.519,0.846,NEGATIVE
,,"I don't know that I personally would describe customer support and convenience as a moat, though. Surely any successful companies going forward will have those as bedrock values - I can't see new businesses in the payment space being successful without that.Also, it doesn't seem that complicated or require that much investment to provide that service to consumers.Your example of them 'always going after the seller and they hate it but what choice do they have' is a good one. PayPal has struggled with understanding and reacting to risk and fraud from the beginning. Seller accounts on eBay getting locked due to 'suspicious activity', merchants getting stuck with bills due to fraud in other cases - it's always seemed a bit Wild West at PayPal in this regard (fraud detection and remediation).PayPal seems to be retaining more of a foothold than I imagined they would 10 years ago, but again I just don't see the things they are doing as all that hard to replicate, and it's mainly been acquisitions (Venmo) to eliminate competition (and rivals that have failed to capitalize on this, like Square/cash app) that have kept them in the game.

,,"Like with anything, it's a trade-off.Do you want heavy exposure to a particular company's growth AND declines? Buy the stock.Do you want exposure to the growth and decline of the weighted average of several companies? Buy an ETF.Generally speaking, and this is very generally speaking, buying individual stocks exposes you to higher potential gains and higher potential losses. Buying an ETF diversifies and averages out to (usually) a slow positive creep. It would take something wiping out value in that entire index or sector or whatever the ETF represents, for the ETF to go down meaningfully.Basically, you trade concentration for diversification with ETFs. You trade the risk of that specific company's management decisions for systematic market risk (which is always present really with stocks but the idea is that the ETF decreases the risks of being too invested in one company, but still subjects you to the risks inherent in the industry your ETF is holding, as well as market risks of the ETF's trading itself.",0,0.56,0.757,NEGATIVE
