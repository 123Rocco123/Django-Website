Marrying(I want to marry my girlfriend for romantic, not practical reasons), owning property between $75,000 to 140,000 and up (there’s two kinds of visas and times they’re valid for, hence two numbers here) and finally, opening a business in Colombia with at least $30,000. They didn’t go into much detail because it was late but they said I wouldn’t actually need to “run” a business so much as have it simply exist.
