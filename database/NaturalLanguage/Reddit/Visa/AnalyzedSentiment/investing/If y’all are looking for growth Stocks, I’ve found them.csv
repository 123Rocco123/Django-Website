Here’s some stocks with a PEG below or right around 1 with decent growth potential and wide profit margins.VRTX- unfairly gapped down about a month ago, has a 0.82 PEG, 0.07 LT D/E, 25% expected eps growth and fat profit margins.AMAT- been on a big run lately but still at a decent value. 16% expected EPS growth and a high ROE. You could have grabbed it in the $50s a couple weeks ago and now it’s nearly $80 so the boat might have sailed for short term gains but it’s still trading at a good value.ATVI- pretty low debt, 1.09 PEG and fat profit margins. Been on a year this year but has been on a downtrend for a while now. Maybe a little TA can help you find a good entry point, or just buy it because fuck it. Could be risky because the video game sector isn’t exactly the golden child when it comes to investments. EA is also a good value, they recently announced a buyback and started a dividend.",0,0.548,0.994,NEGATIVE
