,"if we take bitcoin etc... out of the equation, what can possibly disrupt visa or mastercard?",I find it hilarious that people think it a given that crypto is going to somehow hurt payment processing.The answer would be general macro conditions getting worse which will impact spending or perhaps major companies pairing up with stuff like venmo/zelle to bypass payment processing completely.,0,0.508,0.994,NEGATIVE
,"if we take bitcoin etc... out of the equation, what can possibly disrupt visa or mastercard?","Yep, i think the key downside risks are 1) material slowdown in consumer spend 2) Slowdown in cross-border volume and 3) Regulatory risk from countries such as Russia setting up domestic payment schemes",1,0.516,0.529,POSITIVE
,"if we take bitcoin etc... out of the equation, what can possibly disrupt visa or mastercard?",This may be a dumb question but does ChasePay bypass Visa/MC payment processing? It still processes on your CC but Chase has been pushing ChasePay awfully hard so made me wonder.,1,0.509,0.989,NEGATIVE
,"if we take bitcoin etc... out of the equation, what can possibly disrupt visa or mastercard?",Dude idk what the question is but the answer is always crypto. No brainer.,1,0.501,0.721,NEGATIVE
,"if we take bitcoin etc... out of the equation, what can possibly disrupt visa or mastercard?","The discussion of crypto hurting payment processing is ridiculous and completely self-serving of the crypto community who aggressively promotes the asset class as the greatest thing to happen to mankind and capable of solving world hunger.It's been difficult in this country to get adoption of mobile payments in general (https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2017/apple-pay-adoption-down-and-so-is-the-hype-mobile-pay-usage/); there is no way that crypto is going to be adopted en masse and the payment processing isn't nearly as capable. Where is customer service in using a decentralized asset class as payment if needed? Mobile payments in this country have not taken off because I think most people in this country don't view paying with plastic as broken for one and I think two, people are so into the habit of that they don't use their phone. The other problem is that Apple Pay and Android Pay use NFC, so that's a lot of POS terminals where either there isn't NFC or NFC is not enabled. Samsung Pay can be used with any POS, but again I think people aren't compelled enough to use it - yet. And when you use Samsung Pay or Apple Pay, you're using your card.The concern IMO becomes not the US as much as it becomes China and India and QR codes as payment. I think you are seeing WePay and AliPay get very firmly entrenched in China and India is competitive. That is not saying that Visa and Mastercard can't compete in emerging markets, but I am increasingly of the view that it's going to be a more competitive playing field.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-25/move-over-mastercard-upstarts-gain-in-hot-india-payments-spaceThe biggest concern that I have in terms of the US is Amazon. Amazon is the only company that I think has the means to potentially disrupt payments and has enough reasoning/would see enough benefit to do something about it.""""We could imagine Amazon's banking services growing to more than 70 million U.S. consumer relationships over the next five years or so — the same as Wells Fargo, the third-largest bank in the US.,"" wrote Bain's Gerard du Toit and Aaron Cheris. ""Although many retail bankers and observers have pegged the nimble fintech start-ups as the likely disrupters, it has become clear that established technology firms pose a bigger threat.""Pushing customers toward a co-branded banking account also allows Amazon to cut down on transaction costs, Bain said.Amazon could – according to Bain calculations – avoid more than $250,000,000 in credit card interchange fees every year if finds a bank willing to partner on checking accounts.""
