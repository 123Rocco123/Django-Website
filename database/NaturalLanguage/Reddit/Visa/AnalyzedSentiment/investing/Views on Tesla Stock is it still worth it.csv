,"With this run up in Tesla stock, do you all feel it's still good to get in or has it achieved irrational exuberance like the .com stocks did in 99. Do you still feel it has a chance to go up more or is it way overvalued? I also don't understand how it reached this high considering its fundamentals. What do you all think? Wait for a dip, invest now cause it will keep going up, or avoid this company and invest in something more sure like Coca Cola, Home Depot, Boeing, Walmart, Visa etc?",It just doubled.

It will take Tesla 5-10x years in growth to catch up to those companies and that catchup isnt a certainty. If you are a rational investor, Tesla's current price is absurd.",2,0.529,1.0,NEGATIVE

Everybody else is making Blackberries and Nokias, and their attempts to make iPhones have been nothing short of pathetic.It doesn't matter how many Blackberries they are making NOW, because Blackberries are going to be worthless in a few years. What matters is how many iPhones automakers are making, and in this regard Tesla is way ahead.And no, other automakers cant just start pumping out EVs in mass at any time. Not even close. They have all outsourced all the most expensive components of EVs (batteries, modules, battery packs and motors) making it nearly impossible to compete on price and innovation with the incredibly vertically integrated Tesla.70% of the cost of the Chevy Bolt is outsourced, mostly to LG. It would be more accurate to call it the LG Bolt.Tesla outsources less than 10% of the components of its vehicles, and its about to be even lower as it starts fully producing its own batteries.",3,0.508,1.0,NEGATIVE

Apple may have been saved by Jobs but Tim Cook made Apple what it is today. What Apple and other car companies have in common is the efficient supply chain that Tesla doesn't want.Apple doesn't build individual parts of even there own phone.Maybe Tesla will come out on top in X years but even than I kind of think the price is still overvalued compared to other car manufactures or even other tech companies like Apple and Microsoft.,4,0.527,0.512,NEGATIVE

Apple has the most efficient assembly proses of any companies and that starts at getting the parts of the Iphone which they don't manufacture themselves.That is where the profit of Apple comes from and not from that they own the whole product.,6,0.552,0.999,POSITIVE
