,"Hi, I want to invest in real estate or in a company that buys real estate in Canada in order to get a visa/residency. I was wondering what programs are available in Canada? How much do I have to invest? What if I create an investment company that buys real estate and hires people to fix it up?","There are Canadian REITS, but I'm highly skeptical that simply investing in Canadian RE would help you meet residency requirements.

What if I create an investment company that buys real estate and hires people to fix it up?",thats what im in the process of doing. i was thinking more like buying an investment property (1mil$ + ) and either fixing it or something. I know there is a Quebec program where you have to show a net worth of like 1.6 mil + invest/ borrow the gov 800k at 0% for 5 years... but thats a lot for 0%. I know in the states if you invest something like 500k and create x amount of jobs you can get a visa,1,0.527,0.999,NEGATIVE
