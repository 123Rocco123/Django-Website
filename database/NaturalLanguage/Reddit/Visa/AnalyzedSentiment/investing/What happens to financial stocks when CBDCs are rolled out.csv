,"This includes banks (like JP Morgan, BoA, HSBC), payment networks (Visa, Mastercard), payment processors (Stripe, Square, PayPal), neobanks (Chime, Monzo), and many others. Countries like Canada have a good chunk of their GDP in financials, so it's worth considering the impact. Traditional banks will probably fare well, because they make most of their revenue from lending. But what about the rest? Would we still need a payment network like Visa if the government builds its own crypto network? Why pay the fees to a private payment gateway when you can transact via the state system? (maybe it's cheaper/free, integrates with the IRS, or just preferred by your customers). I wonder if CBDCs will make some (or perhaps most) of the financial sector obsolete. And if so, would it destroy billions of market cap, or would those companies find a way to repurpose themselves. For example, how does PayPal with its high fees stay relevant when people start switching to a CBDC app?","In Europe you can transfer money instantly, for free, to anybody's bank account just by typing in their account number or scanning a QR code and hitting send. No cbdc required, and it's been that way for decades.Most of the world is like this I believe, except for the US which is technologically backwards.",0,0.518,0.92,NEGATIVE

It's disgusting but it's nothing unique to sepa transfers. Cbdcs just makes all that even worse and makes the Chinese social credit model easier to implement here. That's why Bitcoin exists and has a legitimate value. And physical cash, and physical gold, etc.",1,0.51,1.0,NEGATIVE

I hope they fail.With CBDCs governments can track your money, control who you send it to, where and how you can spend it, and freeze, debit it or delete it if the government wants to.We need to educate people on the cons of CBDCs, and why other options are better.",0,0.504,0.994,NEGATIVE

They can close your account any time for any reason. Examples include sending money to a crypto exchange, working in the adult industry, or having the wrong passport (like Iran). Banks used to be much more lax, but got very hostile and risk-averse after the GFC.",1,0.51,0.998,NEGATIVE

Since they are negotiable, and attributable, the owners of the coins will be traceable, unlike bearer bonds…To preserve crypto, it might be best to keep central banks from competing with it.",3,0.51,0.991,NEGATIVE
