,"Hi, I was thinking to invest in the S&P500 index instead of cherry-picking stocks (through Ireland ETF). The reasons are that my country doesn't have a tax treaty with US and to lower the risk of individual stocks. But by looking into S&P index constituents there are many stocks that looks overvalued to me (based on PE ratio, I will assume that 25PE is a reasonable PE for value stocks for a time to come): - AMZN PE 62.25 - its earnings would have to increase 250% to reach PE 25. Through which business segment? Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players. Prime Video? Look at Netflix - new users do not add so quickly, I'm expecting this segment to have a low earnings increase. AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years. - TSLA - while it has a strong brand the valuation that is higher than VW and Toyota combined is questionable. The graveyard is full of people who shorted TSLA although - V (Visa Inc) - PE 54.81 - debit card payments are now the norm even in third-world countries outside of the world. To reach 100% growth in earnings I think you'll have to wait long. - Mastercard - see Visa Inc - NVIDIA PE 83.98 - when crypto mania is over, graphic cards would not be such a great business, compare this to Samsung's PE 21.35, Nintendo's PE 16.41 or TSMC 28.68 - Adobe PE 42.26 - Adobe to grow more than Microsoft? Good luck with that. This is a business software company, compare that with SAP PE 25.27. There are some labor requirements that give Adobe an advantage so my guess is that 35 PE would be reasonable Obviously, I'm assuming some things wrong, but did I underestimate all these companies?","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

I usually look at both. And really I probably shouldn’t of used just FCF in the example above since FCF and R&D expenses (which show up in EBIT) are both used as reinvestment expenses (FCF you have the option to do so, or pay dividends, buy companies, etc).I think Amazon is a unique case where I use P/FCF as a more reliable shorthand measure of value than P/E. Neither are perfect though just because Amazon can influence the R&D line item as they want so it won’t totally fall in FCF. The right way to go is DCFs (which are super hard with Amazon because the growth assumptions are so wild).A company can reinvest in the business in the R&D line item or use FCF to do so.

Their ad revenue growth was 77% YoY for the last quarter and it doesn't really have costs.Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players.I believe, COVID lockdowns have massively changed attitudes in important markets.Two years ago, it was completely normal for a store in Germany to only accept cash as customers didn't really need it to take cards. Now, everyone orders online and pays with CCs. While the growth will slow down a bit, we'll most likely still see faster growth in previously cash-heavy countries.After two years, even technologically challenged people were forced to adapt and recognize the benefits of shopping online. Even my mother, who's in her 60s, lives in Eastern Europe, and couldn't turn on a power bank with a single button, now orders 90% percent of her purchases from the local online stores. Without COVID Amazon had zero chance to sell to this kind of people.AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years.There's basically one competitor, Azure, which still has a long way to go to match AWS.Companies don't want to rely on Google as they are known to kill their commercial products on short notice without providing a replacement. This is reflected by their market share of about 5%, even though they've launched in 2008, two years before Azure.The rest are not even close. They may provide VMs / containers / storage, but they don't have the technology that makes the cloud migration to be worth it(like Amazon Comprehend).Taking the points above into account, we probably won't see a massive decline in AWS growth for a while.",0,0.543,1.0,NEGATIVE

It's natural because their numbers exceed far beyond what small cap and growth can dream to reach.It's similar to market cap. A 500m market cap is easily doubled. If that happens without a specific company or stock related reason, then it's heavily overvalued. For a value stock (though if you look at the charts, which even still defines as one?) a similar increase would probably look more like 500b, but it's equal to 50% of their previous market cap.My point is it's easy to overvalue those that are small, it appears super obvious and a 30%-50% in there is not uncommon, but 30-50% overvalued value stock is equally bad or possibly way worse due to the amount needed (in talks of correction)",4,0.551,0.991,NEGATIVE

Look at Netflix - new users do not add so quickly, I'm expecting this segment to have a low earnings increase. AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years. - TSLA - while it has a strong brand the valuation that is higher than VW and Toyota combined is questionable. The graveyard is full of people who shorted TSLA although - V (Visa Inc) - PE 54.81 - debit card payments are now the norm even in third-world countries outside of the world. To reach 100% growth in earnings I think you'll have to wait long. - Mastercard - see Visa Inc - NVIDIA PE 83.98 - when crypto mania is over, graphic cards would not be such a great business, compare this to Samsung's PE 21.35, Nintendo's PE 16.41 or TSMC 28.68 - Adobe PE 42.26 - Adobe to grow more than Microsoft? Good luck with that. This is a business software company, compare that with SAP PE 25.27. There are some labor requirements that give Adobe an advantage so my guess is that 35 PE would be reasonable Obviously, I'm assuming some things wrong, but did I underestimate all these companies?","Hi Redditor, it would seem you have strayed too far from WSB, there are too many emojis detected.

,"Hi, I was thinking to invest in the S&P500 index instead of cherry-picking stocks (through Ireland ETF). The reasons are that my country doesn't have a tax treaty with US and to lower the risk of individual stocks. But by looking into S&P index constituents there are many stocks that looks overvalued to me (based on PE ratio, I will assume that 25PE is a reasonable PE for value stocks for a time to come): - AMZN PE 62.25 - its earnings would have to increase 250% to reach PE 25.

Buy the cheap ones if you don't like how pricey the darlings are. I would add a negatively correlated style like quality or momentum, but 100% value is defendable.",0,0.53,0.821,POSITIVE

COVID didn't really change my day to day much. Biggest change is switching to online groceries. I don't do the grocery shopping anyway, but ever since COVID started my wife just buys them online and either has them delivered or picks them up after work.

While I agree that some prices are just crazy, you have to factor in the immense liquidity central banks pumped into the system just in the past year, and the fact that bond yields are not an option. PE as a metric is a bit ""flawed"" and better lends itself to more traditional industries. I don't want to say Amazon's PE is justified, but it is so dominant and diversified that probably is the only one that really deserves the price. TSLA on the other hand has nothing to back that valuation",0,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE
