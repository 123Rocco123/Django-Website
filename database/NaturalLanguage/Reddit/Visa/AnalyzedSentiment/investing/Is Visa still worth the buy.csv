,"I usually have give a stock a full year of patience before I consider docking it. I only have 5 shares of Visa but I've made a whopping 4.93% on this stock in the past year, or below market average. The stock is actually down from $205 to $201.65 in the past year. It's gone from $195.15 to $201.65 in the past 6 months. It had a nice run-up in early January (to $220.25) but gave it all back. In other words, it's stuck. Is this still worth keeping my money in or should I switch to some other relatively safe but better runway stock (thinking Bank of Montreal or Vornado atm)?","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

Great companies to own but you might want to wait for a pullback to take a position. If that doesn’t happen I’d personally pass. I recently sold out of both because they hit a specific gain and I couldn’t justify holding any longer.On the other hand, these are also momentum trades (based on positive Covid news). If any good news comes out, they might put up some good gains (V, MA and AXP) but at that point I doubt you’d be investing based on any sort of fundamental or earnings growth prospects.Really bad thing about both is they are a duopoly. It’s bad because Biden is elected and this administration may (justifiably) look to add regulations that will target these companies. That would definitely put pressure on price.You also have Venmo, plaid, stripe, square, PayPal etc that can be used to pay for things. Millennials and Gen Z seem to be moving away from utilizing credit and just paying for things outright with these other platforms. This will probably reduce the earning power of V and MA when they are forced cater to these users.",0,0.521,1.0,NEGATIVE

They're pretty much a duopoly with Mastercard and they're the larger of the two already so I don't see where they can take share.I'm in DFS instead and bought in initially in the 50s. They have a 2% dividend yield at current prices, an announced stock buyback of $1.1B this year (12M shares out of 308M at current price), and had grown revenues and profits by double digits for years prior to COVID.They've taken a dive lately despite an earnings beat due to predictions of higher defaults later this year, but have already set aside money for it and are taking marketshare in online banking and student loans. If those predictions don't come to pass you've got potentially over a billion more that can be returned to shareholders.",0,0.552,0.998,NEGATIVE

Same as Master Card. The global shift to cashless transactions, ironically being accelerated by the Pandemic which has slowed them down this year.I believe there is a long runway of growth for both. The big question is whether Fintech innovation will be something that helps them grow or that eventually becomes something that makes them less relevant.Disclosure: I'm loooong on $MA.

International acceptance has turned out to be an easy problem to solve with Discover having 3 reciprocal agreements in place now (JCB, Unionpay, and RuPay).",2,0.531,0.983,NEGATIVE

I feel they peaked a longtime ago. Unless they make some kind of tech where we can store Bitcoins on our credit cards or something.V and MasterCard are very low risk though because they don't lend money. While Discover Financial lends money to high risk individuals.Both V and MA are overvalued so things are priced in.At this point V and MA are like investing in water.,0,0.534,0.975,NEGATIVE
