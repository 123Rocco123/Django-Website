However, if you really don’t need the money, I’d recommend looking into an IRA and see if your employer offers a 401K and start contributing to that as well.As for the car, do some research now and start budgeting for the car. In addition to the car payment, think about gas costs, maintenance, and insurance. I’ve found it’s helped me to sit down and build a budget sheet to determine exactly how much I can invest.",0,0.514,0.612,NEGATIVE

On the other hand 4 years isn't quite long enough for the market to make sense imo. I'd shoot for 5 years minimum. 10 is much better. Having an emergency fund in something that's FDIC insured to cover the unexpected is also super important.$160 a month isn't going to get you much car unless you buy used and have a hefty down payment. (Gotta account for gas and insurance in addition to the payment.) You could always save the $160/month plus your $7.5k in a high yield savings account or CD. Even I-Bonds work for 3-4 years. Then you've got your down payment.But as others have said the best long term play is to throw the money in an IRA and leave it there for 30+ years.

If it's money you expect you won't need before ten years at least (fifteen years at least would be better), investing in the stock market makes a lot of sense; but over such a short timeline there's no telling what the market will do.You are planning to get a car soon - that will cost you quite a bit of your savings, and it will increase your expenses on top of that.

It still has two years to maturity, but now nobody wants to buy it from you on the secondary market because new 3-year Tbills are paying 4-5 times as much interest.

Here's the long answer.In personal finance, you prioritize needed cash over investing. So most primarily, you need 6 months of expenses (minimum) cash saved in a high yield savings account (HYSA). Now I have no idea how you are only paying out 160/mo, but consider yourself literally one of the luckiest people in the entire country if that's what your expenses are (assuming you're in the US based on the F1). I'm guessing you've got some kind of subsidy/stipend/whatever coming from someone, and in that case I'd add up all of your actual (including subsidized) expenses and then multiply by 6 to get the final ""emergency fund"" number. Eventually, whatever subsidies you are receiving will not be there. You need to be prepared for that, first and foremost.So next you're talking about buying a car. Once you have that emergency fund aside, and only once you have it set aside, you can set your sights on saving for something like a car. That's an entirely separate cash fund, also in a HYSA. Once you're done with that, you can move on to start investing.Now with respect to investing, the idea you're ever going to invest for ""3.5-4 years"" is totally incorrect. We invest for decades, as it is totally impossible to predict where the market will be over the span of a few years. We might be reaching new highs or deep in the throws of another recession or depression. There is absolutely no way you or anyone else is going to predict that effectively. Therefore, if you are going to invest, it's meant to be money you'll use at a minimum in 20+ years. And even then, you invest with the understanding that the whole or a good portion of the invested money could be lost, but investing for 20+ years gives one the highest chance of positive returns (based on historical data, which may not effectively predict the future). The idea that you're to invest long term (>20 years) and not short term (say, 5 years) is an extremely important concept because investing short term is a seriously confused preconceived notion that many investors have when they first post on this board. Now that you know, I hope you will seriously reconsider your personal finance goals, as it is abundantly clear right now that your only move is to further stockpile cash until you are comfortably secure enough to begin investing. That's a 6 month emergency fund of real, unsubsidized expenses, and then a separate fund for whatever else you need to save for.7.5k is not a lot in the US, and so if I'm you, the very last thing on my mind is investing in the stock market.",0,0.529,0.999,NEGATIVE

Better to let your money sit there than lose half of it in a month.
