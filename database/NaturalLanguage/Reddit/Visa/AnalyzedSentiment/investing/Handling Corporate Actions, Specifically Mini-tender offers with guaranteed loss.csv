,"Is there a ""best practice"" or at least a resource for good information regarding corporate actions like tender offers? In general the legal wording make it difficult and time consuming to decipher For example the latest tender offer from Ponos to owners of AT&T (ticker: T) where it sounds like they are offering a premium of 20% ($36 compared to current price $30) but researching further I found below article clarifying that accepting the offer can only lead to loss because it will only take effect if the price is above $36 when it expires... https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/AT-T-INC-14324/news/AT-T-Recommends-Stockholders-Reject-Mini-Tender-Offer-from-Ponos-Industries-LLC-30780426/ So the questions I hope you can assist with are What do you do in general with corporate actions to avoid mis steps or excessive time spent? Why are mini-offers like above with guaranteed loss even legal? Digging deeper it seems that Ponos has done the exact same on Exxon, Visa, GE, Oracle and Verizon! Any input or links to resources is greatly appreciated!","Hi, welcome to r/investing.
