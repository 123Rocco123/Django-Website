,"I need some help with deciding where to put some money. Currently I have 50k in a savings account, and have set up my 401k contributions to meet my employer's match. The issue is where to go from here. I am currently on a work visa, with no intention of staying in the US through retirement. I am expecting to stay in the US for a maximum of 16 years, and will most likely leave in a decade. I'm not sure that maxing out 401k + Roth IRA is advisable in my situation. My country has no tax treaty with the US, so I'll most likely be subject to the full 30% tax rate on interest and dividend during withdrawal. Will investing in a Roth IRA help me be exempt from this tax? Will investing in a low cost index fund in a taxable brokerage account be more efficient (in terms of flexibility) compared to locking away money until I'm 60? On the other hand, I am in a relatively high income tax bracket right now, and I would like to take reasonable steps in order to reduce that burden. If I max out the traditional 401k, will I be able to keep that account open without being a US resident? What's the most efficient thing to do in this situation? I've done substantial research on this, and I haven't found anything substantive on this issue. I'm definitely hoping to just set an amount to set aside in a vehicle that makes sense so I can forget about it and focus on income generation for the next decade. Avoiding excessive taxes is preferable but at this point, I'm ready to give up. TLDR: immigrant, wants to retire in home country. Which option is ideal? A. Meet employer 401k match, invest the rest in an index fund with international brokerage (Charles Schwab) B. Max out 401k (19k), max out Roth IRA (6k), leave rest in taxable index fund C. Do B, and then invest further 27.5k in Mega backdoor Roth IRA, leave rest (I have very little left at this stage) in taxable index fund D. Do nothing, cry in a corner at tax complications from international employment If anyone has experience with this, I would also love to hear your story!","This article covers various scenario that might be helpful to you:https://myrawealth.com/insights/what-to-do-with-your-401k-if-you-move-back-to-your-home-countryEssentially Your 401k and Roth IRA will be tax free (in the US) after 59.5 years, but 30% of the distribution will be withheld (because you will become non resident alien by then) and you need to file 1040NR to IRS every year to get that back.You also need to consider how that distribution will be taxed in your home country. You may be taxed by your home country on that distribution.Additionally, If you're in high income bracket, you also need to prepay your 401k tax (as if you get lumpsum distribution at the date of your expatriation) before you return back to your home country.

I believe that even though it was a trustee-to-trustee transfer, she still paid the income taxes which had been deferred during her US residence and employment, but was exempted from any early withdrawal penalties.If the same conditions still hold and would apply to your situation, it's simply a matter of ""pay me now, or pay me later"". There's a good argument to be made for ""pay me later"", which means put as much into tax-deferred accounts as you can, thus capturing as much growth as you can, even though you have to pay taxes on that growth eventually.Some actual modelling might be in order here.Good luck, though!",0,0.515,1.0,NEGATIVE
