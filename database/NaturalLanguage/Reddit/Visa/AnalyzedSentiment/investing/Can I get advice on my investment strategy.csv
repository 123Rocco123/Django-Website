You'd just be getting extra exposure to them.Your VTSAX holdings already have the following concentrations:Microsoft Corp.3.00% Apple Inc.2.80% Amazon.com Inc.2.50% Alphabet Inc.2.30% Berkshire Hathaway Inc.1.50% Johnson & Johnson1.40% JPMorgan Chase & Co.1.30% Facebook Inc.1.20% Exxon Mobil Corp.1.20% Pfizer Inc.1.00%10 largest holdings = 18.20% of total net assetsThats just the top-10, but all the names you listed are top holdings in VTSAX.I'd just put it all in VTSAX to simplify at this point. If you are interested in gambling or learning investing, then do some reading about value investing & come back to the 3rd bucket when you are ready.",0,0.526,0.879,NEGATIVE

My Roth and Taxable accounts are 100% in VTSAX. If possible, I would also have my 401K in-line as well. Unfortunately, however, my plan does not offer said fund, as such, it is allocated in company stock. Since I do not plan on needing/using any of the allocated funds for 25+ years I feel very comfortable having it at its current allocation.",0,0.585,0.992,POSITIVE

Keeping just one asset class is the biggest mistake most retail investors make. Stocks will do particularly badly and diversification will not help you hide if there is deflation in the currency. Invest some of your income in bonds or stocks that reliably raise their dividends each year. Invest some of your money in real estate.

With people living longer, now many have gone to 110 or even 120-age.You have not explained how you are picking the individual stocks you invest in. They will have more (upside and downside) risk.
