,"Over the last few years, the US DOJ's Antitrust Division took a notably lighter approach in interfering with anti-competitive practices, including surprising many by allowing moves such as the T-Mobile and Sprint merger. Towards the end of 2020 however, the Antitrust division did sue to block the merger between Visa and Plaid. And this morning, news was released on a new investigation, dropping VISA's stock again. The current Administration is making Antitrust enforcement a greater focus over at least the next 4 years. Recently, a lot of focus has been placed on the rising rates of the 10-year treasury, the spiking Sharpe Ratio of the S&P 500, and the post-COVID new normal run up of Tech stocks. All these are certainly large contributing factors in recent market activity, but could the greater focus on antitrust activity be having a larger than expected impact as well? Supporting this idea, Apple is down nearly 18% from its peak over the last year. Countering this idea, Facebook is on its way back up towards its 52-week peak. What does everyone think? Is increased focused on impactful antitrust enforcement contributing to the recent drop, especially in Tech? Will small and medium Tech and Financial stocks see any boost relative to those with massive market capitalization? Or is this all not having much of a market impact at all, and we'll see even Visa's and Apple's stocks jump back up later in the year?","That's a fair take. But I was looking more at the perception/fear it may happen impacting things, regardless of what actually happens.You don't think any of the most egregious cases will be acted on for show at least?",0,0.509,1.0,NEGATIVE

There isn't really a great reason to think that trust busting will come to force given the composition of the government. There is going to be the same ol' same wrist slapping and light fines.,2,0.508,1.0,NEGATIVE
