,"Which is a better buy for longterm, is the momentum still going to go up, is it to late??",It's like asking coke or Pepsi,0,0.5,0.976,NEGATIVE
,"Which is a better buy for longterm, is the momentum still going to go up, is it to late??",But as far as investing goes.... Wouldn't you choose coke?,1,0.509,0.554,NEGATIVE
,"Which is a better buy for longterm, is the momentum still going to go up, is it to late??","I prefer coke, but 100% Pepsi from an investment perspective. Pepsi’s returns has beat cokes. Pepsi has a better diversified portfolio that includes a great snack business which is what has lead its gains.",2,0.533,0.956,POSITIVE
,"Which is a better buy for longterm, is the momentum still going to go up, is it to late??","In hindsight, it's natural for retail investors to lean KO because of Buffet propping it up. You'll see many comments quote Buffet on KO as if they were their own. But his positions are from decades ago.PEP looks to be more dynamic and agile when it comes to products and growth.",2,0.523,0.903,NEGATIVE
,"Which is a better buy for longterm, is the momentum still going to go up, is it to late??","I mean if that's a commonly held sentiment, then the two would be priced appropriately to reflect that and it would still be a wash",2,0.516,0.802,NEGATIVE
,"Which is a better buy for longterm, is the momentum still going to go up, is it to late??","fool: Mastercard's business model When consumers make purchases using Mastercard products (whether via a plastic card or digital platform), Mastercard collects a small percentage of the transaction as a fee. While merchants will ultimately miss out on about 2.5% to 3.5% of the total transaction amount, much of that missing total goes to the card issuers and the merchants' banks for their roles in the transaction. Smaller amounts go to the payment processing service (the provider of the hardware and software that allows merchants to accept cards at the point-of-sale) and the payment network (e.g. Mastercard).Thus Mastercard only collects a fraction of a percentage as a fee -- but this quickly compounds across Mastercard's millions of cards and the transactions facilitated with them. In Mastercard's 2019 first quarter, the company's 2.54 billion cards were used to make 19.2 billion transactions worth almost $1.5 trillion. Small fees quickly add up when we're talking about these kinds of numbers!The beauty of Mastercard's (and Visa's) business model is that, once the underlying infrastructure is in place, there is little additional cost for Mastercard to accept more payments. In other words, as Mastercard scales, increased transactions quickly add to the bottom line.Mastercard's growth As card and digital payments grow the use of cash and personal checks decreases, a trend which could be called the ""war on cash."" Several catalysts are driving this war on cash, directly leading to higher use of the Mastercard network, including e-commerce, mobile payments, and more acceptance of card and digital payment at physical points-of-sale.Most of us intuitively understand that using cash or checks for online purchases is, at best, much more inefficient and cumbersome than card or digital payments. As e-commerce increasingly takes market share from brick-and-mortar retail, it provides a strong tailwind for Mastercard. As Visa CFO Vasant Prabhu explained the benefits of this trend:E-commerce is growing 5-times as fast as face-to-face transactions. And in an e-commerce transaction, the propensity to use a Visa card is twice as high as a face-to-face transaction. So something growing 5-times as fast where your propensity to be used is twice what it might have been. That's phenomenal.While Prabhu was talking about Visa, the same benefits also apply to Mastercard.Mobile payments provide another catalyst to Mastercard. Nearly all popular digital wallet platforms in North America and Europe, including PayPal Holdings' (NASDAQ:PYPL) core platform and Venmo and Square Inc's (NYSE:SQ) Cash App, use the payment network rails provided by Mastercard and Visa to move money. (Important note: The same dynamics for Mastercard and Visa do not exist for many popular digital wallet platforms in Asia, such as Alipay, PayTM, and WeChat Pay.) Square's Cash App had more than 15 million monthly active users at the end of 2018, and PayPal reported 277 million active user accounts in its 2019 first quarter, more than 40 million of which were Venmo accounts. The popularity of these platforms for making purchases or sending friends money only increases the chance that Mastercard's rails are used for a transaction.Finally, more merchants than ever before are able to accept cards as payments. Square made accepting card payments as easy as plugging a small dongle into a smartphone in the U.S., while iZettle, since acquired by PayPal, did the same in Europe. Meanwhile, QR codes, the black-and-white matrix images that can be scanned by smartphones, have been heavily adopted by merchants in emerging markets since they can be used without expensive hardware or a landline internet connection.These catalysts have consistently driven Mastercard's top- and bottom-line growth. In Q1, revenue rose to $3.89 billion, a 13% year-over-year increase, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew to $1.78, a 24% increase year-over-year.Mastercard's future So where will Mastercard be in five years? While my crystal ball is broken, I don't foresee too much happening to displace Mastercard's vital role in the payments ecosystem over the next few years. The company's network effect, which makes its platform more valuable the more users it has, makes it exceedingly difficult for a disruptive upstart or competitor to take its place.Of course, due to its envy-inducing margins, there will always be those that try. Investors should definitely keep an eye on big banks and tech giants experimenting with new technology, such as Facebook Inc's (NASDAQ:FB) efforts with Libra. That being said, I would be very surprised if the next five years did not see Mastercard trouncing the S&P 500 again.",0,0.542,0.999,NEGATIVE

,"Which is a better buy for longterm, is the momentum still going to go up, is it to late??","As the world continues to shift towards cashless/paperless, V and MA will continue to grow and grow. I personally own V and PYPL in this space and like them both. MA is trading at a premium to V at the moment and seems a bit pricy. I’d go with V and/or PYPL - both have plenty of room to run.",0,0.51,1.0,POSITIVE
,"Which is a better buy for longterm, is the momentum still going to go up, is it to late??","Neither. Most banks are already experimenting with their payment processes (they definitely have the clout to back payments), online wallets are 2 steps away from simply kicking the middle man out and these companies have been unsuccessful in targetting 3+ billion people.Additionally, you still have other businesses in the same sector that are breaking the duopoly. American Express has targetted retail credit purchases by introducing Cobalt and discover is looking to partner with Stone to make an online payment portal.The entire African sub-continent, India, and China are lacking their presence. Cash is big in the first two and V/MA don't come to close the grip that WePay (Wechat's payment option) has over the country. Lastly, Whatsapp is already experimenting with payment options that may give these companies more competitive.For me, the only thing that stops investment into these firms is their limited offerings. They have no other product offering and no real competitive advantage. Asides from payment processing, is there anything else these companies can offer?",0,0.518,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Which is a better buy for longterm, is the momentum still going to go up, is it to late??","This has been mentioned to death, but V and MC own the network in which these payment plan operate. For any libra crypto to work, payments would just go through these networks as a method to purchase these product or collect the money.Of course places like China or Africa will have payment networks that bypass them, it does not mean they will not continue to operate in these locations.Unless of course you can invest in Alipay if you want.",1,0.519,0.954,NEGATIVE
,"Which is a better buy for longterm, is the momentum still going to go up, is it to late??","For any libra crypto to work, payments would just go through these networks as a method to purchase these product or collect the money.Are you sure about that? I thought libra was a new network. Perhaps it will interface with old networks, but the whitepaper seems to describe a distinct libra network that isnt simply piggy backing on credit card networks or any existing structure. Do you specifically mean the onramp into Libra, ie people exchanging USD for Libra, would operate on legacy networks? Because that at least would likely be true. But after Libra network growth slows and the network becomes mature the onramp wont be as important.",2,0.527,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Which is a better buy for longterm, is the momentum still going to go up, is it to late??","In that case I was referring to the on-ramp. However, unless they are moving to 100% Libra, then at some point it has to be converted back, either via the network or straight to a bank account.And if it via a bank account, bank charges will apply.At present, I do not see a massive movement to cryptocurrency unless it is for currency transfer, given that any sales will still require the taxes to be calculated in local currency.So, we see if libra becomes a global method of transfer (like TransferWise) or a global currency like facebuck or something.",3,0.527,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Which is a better buy for longterm, is the momentum still going to go up, is it to late??","I picked MA because I thought the smaller company would have more room to grow.

,"Which is a better buy for longterm, is the momentum still going to go up, is it to late??","What about the management, or the p/e ratio (V has a slightly lower p/e and forward p/e).I made financial charts comparing both companies (as well as a few others) and ranking them on over a dozen financial criteria. Mastercard and Visa ended up dead even in my final tally. So yeah, I went with the company that has more room to grow.",1,0.541,1.0,NEGATIVE

,"Which is a better buy for longterm, is the momentum still going to go up, is it to late??","Neither. I don’t view payments as a long term shoo-in.The trend in Visa/MasterCard platform use amounts to issuing banks competing for cardholders via cash back inducements that ultimately come out of the pockets of merchants. Just as in mutual fund competition for financial advisor money via 12b-1 fees, I consider an increasing likelihood of pushback from the ultimate parties paying the fees and/or their advocates.",0,0.516,1.0,NEGATIVE
