How popular is this card in the USA and the Asian countries where it has already been approved?","If you are making money from staking coins, the Spend card is appealing. But it won’t move the needle for Visa",0,0.509,1.0,NEGATIVE

If you're not into crypto, why would you have any crypto?Aside from illegal activity, I see no benefit to transacting in crypto. Yeah I don't see this taking off at all. I wouldn't be surprised if its canceled in a couple of years.",0,0.506,1.0,NEGATIVE

Are you in it for practical use reasons, or want to see more adoption? Then this is useful.",1,0.517,0.961,POSITIVE

How popular is this card in the USA and the Asian countries where it has already been approved?","I feel like that’s a ridiculously small segment though. Most people who are into crypto are either speculators or investors. If you can buy something for $10k USD or 1 BTC, what’s the point of transacting in BTC? The only reason is if you’re a real enthusiast and get satisfaction out of using btc.",2,0.513,1.0,NEGATIVE

How popular is this card in the USA and the Asian countries where it has already been approved?","Yeah that's a pretty small segment, although it's much more common in countries with oppressive fiscal policy (Venezuela, China.)I suspect there will eventually come a time when crypto's volatility stabilizes and then the option to use it as a currency will feel way less scary to many people. I suspect Western countries will be the last to adopt it if that happens.Now, if we end up with explosive inflation of the world's reserve currency (US dollar) you will almost certainly see that trend accelerate.Cards like this are really for enthusiasts or people who genuinely rely on cryptocurrency for their banking/spending. It's a small market. Most everyone else who holds crypto is using it as an investment.",3,0.519,0.998,NEGATIVE

Then the bank transacts from them to the federal reserve. The Federal reserve verifies it and transacts it to my friends bank, who then transacts to my friend.Do you see how many an automated procurement process may be useful?",1,0.519,0.968,NEGATIVE

How popular is this card in the USA and the Asian countries where it has already been approved?",If I've earned a lot of money in crypto then it would make sense. I don't want to cash everything to $/£/€ because of tax and still I believe enough in its future growth prospects that I dont want to miss out on. Maybe this hoard is large enough to make me financially free and becomes my main source for expenses. Having an easy way to spend as I go makes sense.,1,0.516,0.586,NEGATIVE
