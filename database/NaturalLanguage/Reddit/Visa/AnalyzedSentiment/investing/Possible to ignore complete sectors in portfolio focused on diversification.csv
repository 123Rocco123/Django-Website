,"Pretty much title .. for sake of argument I’ll use my portfolio.. I currently own 0 shares of any financial institution .. (while I do own berk+visa, I don’t consider those representative of financial sector).. I consider my portfolio to be fairly well diversified thru individual stocks and a few etfs .. however I have zero interest in investing in financial sector .. in closing my question is how necessary is it to represent each sector in diversification?",What stocks and ETFs do you have in your portfolio? I think it would be hard to exclude a whole industry (that comprises >10% of the GDP) and have a well-diversified portfolio.,0,0.532,0.975,POSITIVE

I consider my portfolio to be fairly well diversified thru individual stocks and a few etfs .. however I have zero interest in investing in financial sector .. in closing my question is how necessary is it to represent each sector in diversification?",I have 43 different holdings .. I’m not listing them all .. question at hand is diversification possible while ignoring an entire sector.. I’m aware some etfs and berk have to do with financials but I wouldn’t consider them as financial sector representation esp at the levels I own ..,1,0.509,0.985,NEGATIVE

I'm not an investment advisor and this isn't investment advice, but I think it can work if you put a specific strategy to use. Not sure that it would be viable for a diverse portfolio when it comes to trying to mimic the performance of the market at large.Here is an example of an alternative strategy that looks for deep value, not sure how well it works compared to diversified investing in to the total stock market. It's also a lot more active investing, too.",2,0.559,0.632,NEGATIVE

I don’t think they tell the whole story and can often miss key details .. my largest gains have been buying stock that had pretty much unanimous sell ratings across board .. (325% gains and they still won’t list it as a buy ;) ),3,0.533,0.863,NEGATIVE

Not sure what's the point in pretending you don't.But to the question, I read somewhere that after 20 stocks--assuming they aren't horrible picks--your portfolio is likely to correlate extremely highly with the S&P. I imagine if you had 40 stocks distributed through a bunch of sectors, but not all of them, you'd perform roughly the same as someone with 45 stocks with those extra 5 being in your missing sectors.",3,0.518,0.926,NEGATIVE

I’ve been moving a lot more money into broad sector etfs (spy dia qqq) as my investment style is changing as I get older..Also I really can’t consider visa as a financial company .. to me they just seem lik much more of a payment service provider. So if visa is financial then so is sq and PayPal and to me this just doesn’t really fit .. I’m sure people will disagree here tho,4,0.536,1.0,NEGATIVE

All I can say is that this what I try to do and most of time I'm successful at it. When it's not working it's because I've misjudged the expected return of a position or positions.
