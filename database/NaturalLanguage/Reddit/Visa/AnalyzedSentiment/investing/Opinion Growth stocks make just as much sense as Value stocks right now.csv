,"Firstly, when I refer to Growth vs Value, let’s assume I mean the holdings of VUG vs those of VTV. Anyway, after spending a couple of hours per day for the last couple of months reading up on the macro economic environment and trying to gauge where things are heading, I have come to the conclusion… It a futile exercise. It’s a very complex system with no underlying unifying logic, and nobody knows a whole lot about where anything is heading right now. Regardless, let’s go with the general consensus for arguments sake, that there will be a recession that sets stocks back around another 20% or so which would be 40% or so down from the ATH. From my point of view, the fundamentals don’t currently look great for either growth or value stocks. Considering the state of play, there’s no real reason the market as a whole should be higher than it was in say, Jan 2020, but it is. Earnings estimates still look quite rosy from here, so will most likely trend further downwards. Again, who knows. Based on the current outlook, prevailing wisdom as of late has encouraged people to shift to value stocks and buckle down with some ‘recession proof’ stocks, or those that do well during periods of inflation. You know the ones; companies with high pricing power, low capital expenditure on operations, ROI on capital higher than cost of capital, high free cash flows, essential to consumers, etc. I definitely agree that shifting to value would have been a smart move about 6 months ago, and I am not going to try and argue against investing in inflation resistant stocks, but what I will say is that if you are looking forward and considering acquiring stocks right now to make a return in the long run, value stocks are not necessarily the way to go. Not only do many growth stocks meet the above inflation resistant criteria, but many are getting to attractive prices for the first time in a long while. Case in point, S&P 500 growth stocks are down over 30% from their ATH already. S&P 500 Value stocks are only down 12%. Personally, my strategy has been to accumulate iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF while it’s down, and continue acquiring it while it goes further downwards to get a reasonable average price per share for when it rebounds. If you look at the top 10 holdings - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta, Visa, Home Depot - it’s more likely that these companies will recover faster when things eventually improve, and IMO they have better medium to long term prospects, especially at a potentially discounted price. Since starting my shift from VOO 3-4 weeks ago as well as investing some spare cash, I’ve gotten in at an average price of $226, which is about 27% down from its ATH. I plan to continue acquiring more during the dips on a regular basis as things get worse. My logic is that if my portfolio is made up of large cap growth companies acquired at, let’s say, 35-40% down from their ATH, then even if things are worse than expected, it still shouldn’t take more than a couple years to regain my investment value. On the upside, if things are not as bad as expected and things rebound, I’ll have acquired these stocks at a discount. The reason I’m saying this is because there seems to be this growing consensus that everyone should be looking at low volatility, high dividend, stable value stocks from now on. This would have made sense at the start of the year, but I don’t really see any reason for this now. It feels like retail investors (like myself) are always a step behind. TLDR: IMO, large cap growth stocks will perform better when we eventually begin to recover and nobody knows when this will be. So, instead of being super late to the ‘buy value stocks’ party, why not arrive early to growth stocks. This is just my opinion, and I’m totally open to being wrong. I’d love to hear other peoples thoughts on this.","It's quite possible we are in early stages of an era where capital is going to cost more for many years.

It’s a very complex system with no underlying unifying logic, and nobody knows a whole lot about where anything is heading right now.

Earnings estimates still look quite rosy from here, so will most likely trend further downwards. Again, who knows. Based on the current outlook, prevailing wisdom as of late has encouraged people to shift to value stocks and buckle down with some ‘recession proof’ stocks, or those that do well during periods of inflation. You know the ones; companies with high pricing power, low capital expenditure on operations, ROI on capital higher than cost of capital, high free cash flows, essential to consumers, etc. I definitely agree that shifting to value would have been a smart move about 6 months ago, and I am not going to try and argue against investing in inflation resistant stocks, but what I will say is that if you are looking forward and considering acquiring stocks right now to make a return in the long run, value stocks are not necessarily the way to go. Not only do many growth stocks meet the above inflation resistant criteria, but many are getting to attractive prices for the first time in a long while.

Earnings estimates still look quite rosy from here, so will most likely trend further downwards. Again, who knows. Based on the current outlook, prevailing wisdom as of late has encouraged people to shift to value stocks and buckle down with some ‘recession proof’ stocks, or those that do well during periods of inflation. You know the ones; companies with high pricing power, low capital expenditure on operations, ROI on capital higher than cost of capital, high free cash flows, essential to consumers, etc. I definitely agree that shifting to value would have been a smart move about 6 months ago, and I am not going to try and argue against investing in inflation resistant stocks, but what I will say is that if you are looking forward and considering acquiring stocks right now to make a return in the long run, value stocks are not necessarily the way to go. Not only do many growth stocks meet the above inflation resistant criteria, but many are getting to attractive prices for the first time in a long while. Case in point, S&P 500 growth stocks are down over 30% from their ATH already. S&P 500 Value stocks are only down 12%. Personally, my strategy has been to accumulate iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF while it’s down, and continue acquiring it while it goes further downwards to get a reasonable average price per share for when it rebounds. If you look at the top 10 holdings - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta, Visa, Home Depot - it’s more likely that these companies will recover faster when things eventually improve, and IMO they have better medium to long term prospects, especially at a potentially discounted price. Since starting my shift from VOO 3-4 weeks ago as well as investing some spare cash, I’ve gotten in at an average price of $226, which is about 27% down from its ATH. I plan to continue acquiring more during the dips on a regular basis as things get worse. My logic is that if my portfolio is made up of large cap growth companies acquired at, let’s say, 35-40% down from their ATH, then even if things are worse than expected, it still shouldn’t take more than a couple years to regain my investment value. On the upside, if things are not as bad as expected and things rebound, I’ll have acquired these stocks at a discount. The reason I’m saying this is because there seems to be this growing consensus that everyone should be looking at low volatility, high dividend, stable value stocks from now on. This would have made sense at the start of the year, but I don’t really see any reason for this now. It feels like retail investors (like myself) are always a step behind. TLDR: IMO, large cap growth stocks will perform better when we eventually begin to recover and nobody knows when this will be. So, instead of being super late to the ‘buy value stocks’ party, why not arrive early to growth stocks. This is just my opinion, and I’m totally open to being wrong.

Anyway, after spending a couple of hours per day for the last couple of months reading up on the macro economic environment and trying to gauge where things are heading, I have come to the conclusion… It a futile exercise. It’s a very complex system with no underlying unifying logic, and nobody knows a whole lot about where anything is heading right now. Regardless, let’s go with the general consensus for arguments sake, that there will be a recession that sets stocks back around another 20% or so which would be 40% or so down from the ATH. From my point of view, the fundamentals don’t currently look great for either growth or value stocks. Considering the state of play, there’s no real reason the market as a whole should be higher than it was in say, Jan 2020, but it is. Earnings estimates still look quite rosy from here, so will most likely trend further downwards. Again, who knows. Based on the current outlook, prevailing wisdom as of late has encouraged people to shift to value stocks and buckle down with some ‘recession proof’ stocks, or those that do well during periods of inflation. You know the ones; companies with high pricing power, low capital expenditure on operations, ROI on capital higher than cost of capital, high free cash flows, essential to consumers, etc. I definitely agree that shifting to value would have been a smart move about 6 months ago, and I am not going to try and argue against investing in inflation resistant stocks, but what I will say is that if you are looking forward and considering acquiring stocks right now to make a return in the long run, value stocks are not necessarily the way to go. Not only do many growth stocks meet the above inflation resistant criteria, but many are getting to attractive prices for the first time in a long while. Case in point, S&P 500 growth stocks are down over 30% from their ATH already. S&P 500 Value stocks are only down 12%. Personally, my strategy has been to accumulate iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF while it’s down, and continue acquiring it while it goes further downwards to get a reasonable average price per share for when it rebounds. If you look at the top 10 holdings - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta, Visa, Home Depot - it’s more likely that these companies will recover faster when things eventually improve, and IMO they have better medium to long term prospects, especially at a potentially discounted price. Since starting my shift from VOO 3-4 weeks ago as well as investing some spare cash, I’ve gotten in at an average price of $226, which is about 27% down from its ATH. I plan to continue acquiring more during the dips on a regular basis as things get worse. My logic is that if my portfolio is made up of large cap growth companies acquired at, let’s say, 35-40% down from their ATH, then even if things are worse than expected, it still shouldn’t take more than a couple years to regain my investment value. On the upside, if things are not as bad as expected and things rebound, I’ll have acquired these stocks at a discount. The reason I’m saying this is because there seems to be this growing consensus that everyone should be looking at low volatility, high dividend, stable value stocks from now on. This would have made sense at the start of the year, but I don’t really see any reason for this now. It feels like retail investors (like myself) are always a step behind. TLDR: IMO, large cap growth stocks will perform better when we eventually begin to recover and nobody knows when this will be. So, instead of being super late to the ‘buy value stocks’ party, why not arrive early to growth stocks. This is just my opinion, and I’m totally open to being wrong.

I'm going with the barbell approach - Large Cap growth ~20-25% (VOO as it becomes more and more undervalued depending on how this plays out) and Small Cap value ~20-25% (AVUV)- those 2 as the core.Steering clear of any Int'l tinkering until I feel more comfortable with my ex-US thesis. But I'm considering adding the Avantis Int'l Dev Small Cap Value ETF (AVDV) to already 10% VEA allocation. Feeling some pressure however on Emerging Mkts (VWO, DGS) since slowed developed GDP growth/inflation seems to hurt EM pretty bad.Thoughts?

You know the ones; companies with high pricing power, low capital expenditure on operations, ROI on capital higher than cost of capital, high free cash flows, essential to consumers, etc. I definitely agree that shifting to value would have been a smart move about 6 months ago, and I am not going to try and argue against investing in inflation resistant stocks, but what I will say is that if you are looking forward and considering acquiring stocks right now to make a return in the long run, value stocks are not necessarily the way to go. Not only do many growth stocks meet the above inflation resistant criteria, but many are getting to attractive prices for the first time in a long while. Case in point, S&P 500 growth stocks are down over 30% from their ATH already. S&P 500 Value stocks are only down 12%. Personally, my strategy has been to accumulate iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF while it’s down, and continue acquiring it while it goes further downwards to get a reasonable average price per share for when it rebounds. If you look at the top 10 holdings - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta, Visa, Home Depot - it’s more likely that these companies will recover faster when things eventually improve, and IMO they have better medium to long term prospects, especially at a potentially discounted price. Since starting my shift from VOO 3-4 weeks ago as well as investing some spare cash, I’ve gotten in at an average price of $226, which is about 27% down from its ATH. I plan to continue acquiring more during the dips on a regular basis as things get worse. My logic is that if my portfolio is made up of large cap growth companies acquired at, let’s say, 35-40% down from their ATH, then even if things are worse than expected, it still shouldn’t take more than a couple years to regain my investment value. On the upside, if things are not as bad as expected and things rebound, I’ll have acquired these stocks at a discount. The reason I’m saying this is because there seems to be this growing consensus that everyone should be looking at low volatility, high dividend, stable value stocks from now on. This would have made sense at the start of the year, but I don’t really see any reason for this now. It feels like retail investors (like myself) are always a step behind. TLDR: IMO, large cap growth stocks will perform better when we eventually begin to recover and nobody knows when this will be. So, instead of being super late to the ‘buy value stocks’ party, why not arrive early to growth stocks. This is just my opinion, and I’m totally open to being wrong. I’d love to hear other peoples thoughts on this.","Our portfolio is globally diversified but with extra emphasis on small cap and value factors. I don't have any growth at all except for the growth style holdings in broad funds in our 401(k)s. I do lean more heavily into small, value and emerging than may be recommended but I am very comfortable with big volatility and have a long time horizon. I do break out my international allocation to emphasize small and value as well. I like to capture the whole market with emphasis on factors that promote long term outperformance, I'm not interested in market timing of any sort.As for your portfolio construction, I think it's fine, aside from my preference to stay out of dedicated growth funds, but that's just a personal thing. I don't necessarily see growth going on another run; those companies were extremely overvalued and this market pullback has brought them more into the fair value range. So my personal opinion is that they're only undervalued relative to what they were, not based on their fundamentals or financials. I also don't recommend borrowing to invest, especially into higher volatility segments of the market, but if you are comfortable with it for yourself, you do you.With bonds, I would hold on. One common misconception is that rising rates are always bad for bonds. They are certainly bad for current bond prices, however, rising rates are good for bond total returns in the long term as bonds with higher yields are added into funds, meaning returns from dividends will go up over the long term. However, if you'd like to get rid of the fund, you would be able to keep the dollar value of the portfolio overall constant and capture a loss (if in a taxable account) by selling out of it, so all is not lost. It sounds like you may have inherited this fund so keep in mind that there was a step up in cost basis upon the transfer to your possession (assuming it was inherited upon death, this doesn't apply if it was simply gifted to you.) That may or may not be beneficial to you depending on when it was inherited. I would say, if you want bonds in your portfolio, you should look to diversify your position by adding some short and mid term (more stable) and getting some broad exposure to corporates and munis, tinkering with duration and credit based on your risk tolerance. I would, however, say that I don't anticipate a Treasury fund to recover all that quickly in the current climate, although maybe it will depending on how much of the anticipated rate hiking you believe is already priced in.",3,0.53,0.911,NEGATIVE

So my personal opinion is that they're only undervalued relative to what they were, not based on their fundamentals or financials.I think you were replying to my comment but not entirely sure, since I didn't reference borrowing money to invest. Either way, could you expand on some of the things you mentioned above? Such as: Are you considering VOO to be a dedicated growth fund or was that in reference to OP? I know VOO contains many growth stocks obvs since it's an index but I had always figured it as a large cap core/blend fund?Also, I agree that the growth companies won't be going on a run anytime soon and yes, extremely overvalued before the correction. But I personally have been running a basic DCF model to get a ballpark intrinsic value for several of the growth stocks that I still see as being strong companies and my results have come out to show intrinsic value well above current market prices. I'm using WACC for getting my discount rate per company and a 5 yr growth projection based on EPS discounted to present. For example, I just did this for $ETSY and found the value to be ~$170 and it's trading at $69 now.My question is, is a DCF method like I mentioned not suitable for evaluating growth companies which are relatively early in their lifespan? Wondering if I'm in severe error here.And I also take into account Price/FCF, Quality of debt, moat size, and a few other metrics that DCF doesn't account for and I'm finding alot of growth stocks attractive. Now, I know that the cost of capital is going to be way more expensive with rising rates and all, and growth will/is surely slowing, but wouldn't you consider that some of these lows are great entry prices (or soon to be) for a long term hold?Thank you for your already insightful and helpful comments!

You know the ones; companies with high pricing power, low capital expenditure on operations, ROI on capital higher than cost of capital, high free cash flows, essential to consumers, etc. I definitely agree that shifting to value would have been a smart move about 6 months ago, and I am not going to try and argue against investing in inflation resistant stocks, but what I will say is that if you are looking forward and considering acquiring stocks right now to make a return in the long run, value stocks are not necessarily the way to go. Not only do many growth stocks meet the above inflation resistant criteria, but many are getting to attractive prices for the first time in a long while. Case in point, S&P 500 growth stocks are down over 30% from their ATH already. S&P 500 Value stocks are only down 12%. Personally, my strategy has been to accumulate iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF while it’s down, and continue acquiring it while it goes further downwards to get a reasonable average price per share for when it rebounds. If you look at the top 10 holdings - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta, Visa, Home Depot - it’s more likely that these companies will recover faster when things eventually improve, and IMO they have better medium to long term prospects, especially at a potentially discounted price. Since starting my shift from VOO 3-4 weeks ago as well as investing some spare cash, I’ve gotten in at an average price of $226, which is about 27% down from its ATH. I plan to continue acquiring more during the dips on a regular basis as things get worse. My logic is that if my portfolio is made up of large cap growth companies acquired at, let’s say, 35-40% down from their ATH, then even if things are worse than expected, it still shouldn’t take more than a couple years to regain my investment value. On the upside, if things are not as bad as expected and things rebound, I’ll have acquired these stocks at a discount. The reason I’m saying this is because there seems to be this growing consensus that everyone should be looking at low volatility, high dividend, stable value stocks from now on. This would have made sense at the start of the year, but I don’t really see any reason for this now. It feels like retail investors (like myself) are always a step behind. TLDR: IMO, large cap growth stocks will perform better when we eventually begin to recover and nobody knows when this will be.

Not only do many growth stocks meet the above inflation resistant criteria, but many are getting to attractive prices for the first time in a long while. Case in point, S&P 500 growth stocks are down over 30% from their ATH already. S&P 500 Value stocks are only down 12%. Personally, my strategy has been to accumulate iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF while it’s down, and continue acquiring it while it goes further downwards to get a reasonable average price per share for when it rebounds. If you look at the top 10 holdings - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta, Visa, Home Depot - it’s more likely that these companies will recover faster when things eventually improve, and IMO they have better medium to long term prospects, especially at a potentially discounted price. Since starting my shift from VOO 3-4 weeks ago as well as investing some spare cash, I’ve gotten in at an average price of $226, which is about 27% down from its ATH. I plan to continue acquiring more during the dips on a regular basis as things get worse. My logic is that if my portfolio is made up of large cap growth companies acquired at, let’s say, 35-40% down from their ATH, then even if things are worse than expected, it still shouldn’t take more than a couple years to regain my investment value. On the upside, if things are not as bad as expected and things rebound, I’ll have acquired these stocks at a discount. The reason I’m saying this is because there seems to be this growing consensus that everyone should be looking at low volatility, high dividend, stable value stocks from now on. This would have made sense at the start of the year, but I don’t really see any reason for this now. It feels like retail investors (like myself) are always a step behind. TLDR: IMO, large cap growth stocks will perform better when we eventually begin to recover and nobody knows when this will be. So, instead of being super late to the ‘buy value stocks’ party, why not arrive early to growth stocks. This is just my opinion, and I’m totally open to being wrong. I’d love to hear other peoples thoughts on this.","Back in Q4 2021, there was a considerable shift from growth to value by most mutual funds, billionaires, etc. It was labeled as future planning and defensive strategy and it was successful. Growth stocks fell at a much higher rate than value. Currently, however, that gap in the rates of decline is closing. The step behind reference comes the fact that the shift into value was something that was done by most institutional investors months ago, and now after much of the damage is done are retailers being encouraged to follow suit. With growth, I may be a step in the wrong direction but I’m not a step behind, if that makes sense.I agree that the point could apply to both classes when they recover, I just feel that even with value stocks having higher dividends, growth stocks have the edge considering how much they will have dropped by. It just seems like they will be oversold seeing as everyone seems to be on the same page about them being priced too high, earnings estimates overly optimistic, etc. Are we accounting enough for positive changes in the economy and global issues?

When you catch yourself using the words ""seems"" and ""feels"" in your investment decision making process, you're making a guess at the entire market's sentiment vs your own.

Value has historically been a rewarded factor over growth, albeit with some ups and downs as seen most significantly during the past decade when value underperformed. But over the long term, value has outperformed. I’m not saying to go all value but shifting from VOO to IWF will obviously lean much heavier towards growth with low % value. Why not continue to do the same strategy with VOO in case you’re wrong? If you’re right VOO will gain but not as much as IWF, but if you’re wrong VOO would outperform IWF. To your last point, you mention you’re transitioning to growth from blended looking to time the growth outperformance which is a change in your investment style due to market movements. Obviously I don’t know what your entire portfolio looks like, but if you’re transitioning your entire portfolio from VOO to IWF, I’d question how that’s sticking to a LT plan.",3,0.528,0.993,NEGATIVE

Regardless, let’s go with the general consensus for arguments sake, that there will be a recession that sets stocks back around another 20% or so which would be 40% or so down from the ATH. From my point of view, the fundamentals don’t currently look great for either growth or value stocks. Considering the state of play, there’s no real reason the market as a whole should be higher than it was in say, Jan 2020, but it is. Earnings estimates still look quite rosy from here, so will most likely trend further downwards. Again, who knows. Based on the current outlook, prevailing wisdom as of late has encouraged people to shift to value stocks and buckle down with some ‘recession proof’ stocks, or those that do well during periods of inflation. You know the ones; companies with high pricing power, low capital expenditure on operations, ROI on capital higher than cost of capital, high free cash flows, essential to consumers, etc. I definitely agree that shifting to value would have been a smart move about 6 months ago, and I am not going to try and argue against investing in inflation resistant stocks, but what I will say is that if you are looking forward and considering acquiring stocks right now to make a return in the long run, value stocks are not necessarily the way to go. Not only do many growth stocks meet the above inflation resistant criteria, but many are getting to attractive prices for the first time in a long while. Case in point, S&P 500 growth stocks are down over 30% from their ATH already. S&P 500 Value stocks are only down 12%. Personally, my strategy has been to accumulate iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF while it’s down, and continue acquiring it while it goes further downwards to get a reasonable average price per share for when it rebounds. If you look at the top 10 holdings - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta, Visa, Home Depot - it’s more likely that these companies will recover faster when things eventually improve, and IMO they have better medium to long term prospects, especially at a potentially discounted price. Since starting my shift from VOO 3-4 weeks ago as well as investing some spare cash, I’ve gotten in at an average price of $226, which is about 27% down from its ATH. I plan to continue acquiring more during the dips on a regular basis as things get worse. My logic is that if my portfolio is made up of large cap growth companies acquired at, let’s say, 35-40% down from their ATH, then even if things are worse than expected, it still shouldn’t take more than a couple years to regain my investment value. On the upside, if things are not as bad as expected and things rebound, I’ll have acquired these stocks at a discount. The reason I’m saying this is because there seems to be this growing consensus that everyone should be looking at low volatility, high dividend, stable value stocks from now on. This would have made sense at the start of the year, but I don’t really see any reason for this now. It feels like retail investors (like myself) are always a step behind. TLDR: IMO, large cap growth stocks will perform better when we eventually begin to recover and nobody knows when this will be. So, instead of being super late to the ‘buy value stocks’ party, why not arrive early to growth stocks. This is just my opinion, and I’m totally open to being wrong. I’d love to hear other peoples thoughts on this.","This is EXACTLY what I have been saying -- ""there’s no real reason the market as a whole should be higher than it was in say, Jan 2020"".Wherever you are considering investing, pull a 5 year chart and don't buy it unless it is below Dec 2019 levels, because that is where we are headed or lower. That means the QQQ still has a 25% drop ahead of it. And if we go into a recession, it will be even worse. Also growth gets hit harder as rates go up.

Not only do many growth stocks meet the above inflation resistant criteria, but many are getting to attractive prices for the first time in a long while. Case in point, S&P 500 growth stocks are down over 30% from their ATH already. S&P 500 Value stocks are only down 12%. Personally, my strategy has been to accumulate iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF while it’s down, and continue acquiring it while it goes further downwards to get a reasonable average price per share for when it rebounds. If you look at the top 10 holdings - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta, Visa, Home Depot - it’s more likely that these companies will recover faster when things eventually improve, and IMO they have better medium to long term prospects, especially at a potentially discounted price. Since starting my shift from VOO 3-4 weeks ago as well as investing some spare cash, I’ve gotten in at an average price of $226, which is about 27% down from its ATH. I plan to continue acquiring more during the dips on a regular basis as things get worse. My logic is that if my portfolio is made up of large cap growth companies acquired at, let’s say, 35-40% down from their ATH, then even if things are worse than expected, it still shouldn’t take more than a couple years to regain my investment value. On the upside, if things are not as bad as expected and things rebound, I’ll have acquired these stocks at a discount. The reason I’m saying this is because there seems to be this growing consensus that everyone should be looking at low volatility, high dividend, stable value stocks from now on. This would have made sense at the start of the year, but I don’t really see any reason for this now. It feels like retail investors (like myself) are always a step behind. TLDR: IMO, large cap growth stocks will perform better when we eventually begin to recover and nobody knows when this will be. So, instead of being super late to the ‘buy value stocks’ party, why not arrive early to growth stocks. This is just my opinion, and I’m totally open to being wrong. I’d love to hear other peoples thoughts on this.","Yes, I wouldn't be selling growth stocks now. If you look at the valuations of KO, PG, CLX, SHW, etc, you'll see companies that either are shrinking revenues or growing at the pace of inflation trading at higher multiples than Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Google. I don't think that is rational at all.",0,0.529,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Firstly, when I refer to Growth vs Value, let’s assume I mean the holdings of VUG vs those of VTV. Anyway, after spending a couple of hours per day for the last couple of months reading up on the macro economic environment and trying to gauge where things are heading, I have come to the conclusion… It a futile exercise. It’s a very complex system with no underlying unifying logic, and nobody knows a whole lot about where anything is heading right now. Regardless, let’s go with the general consensus for arguments sake, that there will be a recession that sets stocks back around another 20% or so which would be 40% or so down from the ATH. From my point of view, the fundamentals don’t currently look great for either growth or value stocks. Considering the state of play, there’s no real reason the market as a whole should be higher than it was in say, Jan 2020, but it is.
