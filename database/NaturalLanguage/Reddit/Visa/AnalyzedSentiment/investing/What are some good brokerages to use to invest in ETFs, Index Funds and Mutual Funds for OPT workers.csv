,"Hi all, Will start working after graduating on an F1 visa. I plan on investing my money in index funds, ETFs and the like (not sure which ones yet specifically), but I'm not looking to day trade. Looking for a brokerage that Does not charge high fees Allows me to access my account and liquidate the stock for years after I leave the US The second point is important as I'm unsure about my intention to stay in the US beyond my OPT visa, but I definitely want to keep my stocks here and see the grow over years. Can someone recommend a good platform to use?","Look into Charles Schwab. They will allow you to keep your account open after you leave the US and you will even be able to keep buying ETFs (though no mutual funds) from abroad.Contrary to what the other person said, Vanguard, while a great investment platform, is not the best option for OPT workers as they will close your account once you leave. I'm on OPT and I just switched from Vanguard to Schwab for this reason. Both have negligible fees.",0,0.542,0.999,NEGATIVE
