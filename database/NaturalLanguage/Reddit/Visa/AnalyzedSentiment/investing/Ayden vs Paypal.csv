Adyen is supposedly cheaper and easier to use, as costumers don’t need an account to use interact with the interface.As for non-cash payment in EU. I live in the Netherlands and haven’t touched a coin in years, we’re moving to a cashless society as well. It’ll probably take a little longer than the US, especially in countries with older populations or generally poorer countries. But This is not a matter of If rather when imo.",0,0.513,1.0,NEGATIVE

They face two primary issues. First, Nike’s global Point-of-Sale (POS) system is fragmented among many intermediaries: different payment gateways, service providers, acquirers, and processors. This structure inherently increases costs as fees are paid to each intermediary in the process. Additionally, it is challenging to create a single view of their customer since they must consolidate payment data from brick-and-mortar, online, and mobile providers. Second, consumer payment preferences around the world differ, meaning Nike must work with a new set of intermediaries for every different geography and form of payment the customer would like to use (e.g., Visa, Alipay, Giropay). This complex, global distribution channel means more vendor contracts, more system and process integrations, and ultimately, higher costs.In 2015, Nike chose Adyen as their payments processor to solve these problems. Adyen is a payment gateway, service provider, acquirer, and processor for online and brick-and-mortar commerce. Adyen requires only one system, one process integration, and one contract for a multinational enterprise to serve customers in 150+ countries and to accept 200+ methods of payment. This massive payments industry has traditionally supported many intermediaries, which Adyen has disrupted.""Also, in terms of Adyen vs Paypal: https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/01/why-ebay-abandoned-paypal-for-a-smaller-european-competitor.html",0,0.526,0.997,NEGATIVE

Who is going to fix this?","I’ve spent the last 14 years in the payments industry.Adyen did 2 things very well (CyberSource/Authorize.net/Global Collect/WorldPay/etc/etc/etc did not do these things and are kind of trying to catch up in some areas)First, Adyen built direct connections to a very large number of payment methods and didn’t rely on connecting to other gateways that then connected to other providers. This resulted in higher transaction approval rates and eliminated the need for businesses to sign multiple agreements and connect to multiple providers. Back in 2014 no one else was doing this. The closest thing was Global Collect but they didn’t have direct connections. Each time you add a ‘hop’ in the transaction flow data is slightly altered (true reason for transaction failure is obscured) and it creates more points of failure. Pricing is also impacted.After that, they were the first company to HEAVILY invest on creating one platform for both in store transactions and online transactions. Before this you had some firms very good at POS and others very good at CNP. This meant if someone buys something online the in store POS doesn’t have full visibility or and easy way to refund a online order.To your specific question, until 2010 ANET was only a gateway and required merchants to have a separate merchant account with an acquiring bank to process payments. Post CyberSource acquisition of ANET they offered acquiring services as well, but it was (and still is) limited to the US and UK.Adyen (literally translated to “do it again”) also had a leg up since the founders created and sold Bibit (translated to “seed” - watch it grow) and knew a lot about the industry and challenges.What is a problem for Adyen is they have become arrogant (some could argue rightfully so) and this is turning off a segment of the merchant community.",2,0.532,1.0,NEGATIVE

Since you have good experience in the payment industry, do you think PayPal and Global Payments are well positioned to outperform it’s competitors in the next 10 years? Do you think there are better investments to be made? I’ve been doing some due diligence regarding the future of digital payments and growth in e-commerce and PayPal and Global Payments stood out the most to me. I am still researching the industry and want to put $1,000 in 2 of the best payment stocks which would pay off in the next 10 years and would really appreciate your input.

Global Payments (GPN) will probably be acquired in the next 10 years as we see more and more consolidation in the industry (FIS type of an event). I do feel they hay day for GPN is over as even CyberSource is moving away from them for acquiring and holding hands with Evo. Either are probably good bets for different reasons.I’m biased and my username shows but I see PayPal getting a big revenue boost in the next two years by getting into the bitcoin game and selling it to its customers (look at the revenue square generates just from that with their cash app).I’d consider buying some PayPal, some GPN and some Evo. Evo seems to be investing like Adyen use to.",4,0.525,0.998,NEGATIVE

Love that PayPal partners with Mercado Libre, the eBay of Latin America, which comes with a great opportunity to get exposure in Latin America. Plus PayPal’s partnerships with AMEX and Walmart add additional value. The company has been operating on its own since 2015 (separation from eBay) and it achieved very impressive results in a relatively short period of time. Also, I see tons of people think that eBay dumped them as a payment processor. They did not dump them, they just added several extra payment options for their customers to choose from including PayPal. The more I am learning about this company the more I believe that it’s well positioned to compete with bigger dogs.",5,0.547,0.992,POSITIVE

Visa needs issuers to put their brand on cards.Chase threw a shit fit post CYBS acquisition as they were/are the largest Visa issuer and didn’t want acquiring competition. CYBS was forced to sell its acquiring portfolio (sold to GPN which it was an ISO of prior to this). Then CYBS became a referral partner of GPN offering acquiring but on GPN paper and a hard cost that was high enough that Chase could forever undercut them on price if needed.CYBS spent 2011 - 2019 happily referring all acquiring to GPN. However, in the last year they started referring acquiring to Evo. At the end of the day, CYBS is primarily a gateway with value added services like fraud management and payment tokenization/hosted payment pages.",6,0.528,0.952,NEGATIVE

Odds are you've used them way more than PayPal, unless that's your preferred method of payment.PayPal is more of the Clippy version of payment (my opinion) they make you sign in, you're well aware that you're using Papal and not the vendor, and this extra level interjection, that depending on the site can be a good or bad thing. If I don't know or trust a site I'll absolutely use PayPal, but given the choice I'd use adyen every time for normal transactions.I can't speak to fees but we use them both at work adyen is by far the preferred payment method. Either way both offer us the ability yo store no payment data on our servers. I think it was about 5 years ago we decided there was no reason to have this data out there just begging to be hacked, so we made these two bear the risk. They have their own API, it bypasses us and we just get a confirmation number. It's quite a nice business model and one that should be sticky as long as we're using credit cards.",0,0.53,0.57,POSITIVE
