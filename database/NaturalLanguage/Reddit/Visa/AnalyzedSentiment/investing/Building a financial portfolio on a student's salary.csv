,"I am a doctoral student with a salary(stipend) of about $20,000 a year after taxes. I am able to save around 45% of my monthly salary, but I am not sure on how to go about investing it. My salary is going to be the same for the next 4 years, hence it is imperative that I start saving more. I am not a citizen of USA, I am on a student visa, hence can't work any side gigs. Investing and stock market are allowed. I don't have any dependents, hence I can take some reasonable amount of risk in my investments. Please do share some advice on where I can start? What are my options? Any books I must read?",To keep this super simple:50% into $VT50% into $BND,0,0.509,0.672,POSITIVE

Any books I must read?","Some practical advice might be to get set up with a high interest savings account.I use CIT Bank to keep my emergency fund from getting hammered by inflation. They offer 2.0% interest. There are a few requirements, so read fine print.Credit Karma started offering 2.0% interest on savings accounts just a few months ago. I believe they have more lenient requirements.Main ingredient in your recipe for future financial prosperity is consistent saving (as a behavior).I'm not familiar with rules regarding nationality and eligibility to patronize certain brokerages. So I have no meaningful guidance for you related to this.I use Vanguard to buy low-fee index funds (ETFs), and have been very pleased with them.Good luck! You are on the right track!",0,0.531,0.947,NEGATIVE
