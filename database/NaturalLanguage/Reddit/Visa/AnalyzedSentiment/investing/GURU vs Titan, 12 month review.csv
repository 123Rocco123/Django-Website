,"GURU and Titan both pick stocks based on top performing hedge funds. Which one is better? There’s only one way to find out. Last year I put $1000 into both GURU and Titan. Titan is a roboadvisor app that will allocate your contributions amongst 20 stocks for you weighted equally. The 20 stocks are picked based on analysis of holdings from actual hedge funds. Analyzing public filings including 13F’s play a major role in determining what stocks are held. They will apply a “short” position to the market depending on the results of your risk tolerance quiz. Seems like they are using Proshares Short S&P500 (SH) for this. All their marketing compares their services to the real hedge funds. You get the top picks, regular research digests, and inverse positions during downturns. All this makes Titan’s 1% advisory fee look like a bargain compared to the 2% fee plus 20% earnings fee that a real hedge fund would charge. Charging 1% is a lot, but it could be worth it if they can match their hypothetical 10 year returns of 12-14% annualized. If you like frequent communication on how each of the 20 corporations are performing, what moves they are making, and how the trade war is impacting business, then Titan is perfect for you. Titan periodically swaps one stock for another, but keeps a cap on 20 stocks total. Here’s what my portfolio holds: Disney (DIS), InterActive (IAC), Charter Communications (CHTR), Visa (V), Autodesk (ADSK), Mastercard (MA), Alphabet (GOOG), Credit Acceptance (CACC), PayPal (PYPL), PTC (PTC), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Transdigm (TDG), Charles Schwab (SCHW), Amazon (AMZN), Boeing (BA), Netflix (NFLX), Salesforce (CRM), Facebook (FB), Constellation (STZ). GLB X FUNDS/GURU IX (GURU) is an ETF that runs a similar style of algorithm, analyzing the public hedge fund filings. The fee is 0.75%. It holds 60 stocks weighted equally. The fee is less compared to Titan for a similar investment approach, but you don’t get the earnings call summaries, videos from the founder, ect. You can find what stocks are in the fund here: https://www.globalxfunds.com/funds/guru/ Here are the values for the purchase date 5-22-18, the same day one year later 5-22-19, and a half way point 11-23-18. The chart compares the value of my Titan account, GURU value, GURU share price, and share price of SPY ETF. 5/22/2018 11/23/2018 5/22/2019 Titan $1000 $965.95 $1113.4 -3.40% 11.30% GURU value $1000.32 $946.88 $1025.6 GURU $31.26 $29.59 $32.05 -5.30% 2.50% SPY $270.94 $263.25 $285.63 -2.80% 5.40% Titan earned 11% in value, GURU only gained 2.5%, while SPY gained 5.3%. All of those gains have evaporated as the market takes a giant deuce. Here are the values from the 5-22-18 to last Friday. I’m at a rough break even with Titan, and GURU is down 1.7%. I expect the retraction to be temporary. BTFD 5/22/2018 5/31/2019 Titan $1000 $998.53 -0.10% GURU value $1000.32 $983.36 GURU $31.26 $30.73 -1.70% SPY $270.94 $275.27 1.60% With the dip in the market, I’ve decided to add an additional $4k to Titan. I’m happy with the performance so far, and the interface is pretty slick. The regular digests make for good talking points that help me look like I’m on top of current events. When I first opened an account with Titan there was a promotion for zero fee on balances up to $1k, so no fee was deducted during the past year. My fee waiver is now expired, but a 1% fee will only cost me about $50 for the year. Not the end of the world. If I convince a friend to open an account, we both get our fees discounted by 0.25%. Four referrals earn me zero fee forever. I’m not going to publicly post my code here per the rules. If you have questions keep it out of the comments and DM me. I wish Titan offered Turbotax integration. I almost threw my computer out the window adding the 1099 information manually. The forms were easy to download from Titan, but the interface in Turbotax to enter the numbers was utter garbage. I understand minimum viable product and everything, but I’m dumbfounded that a cutting edge fintech software company doesn’t have this. Apparently there was a way to do this with an Apex account that I didn’t learn about until after I filed. As far as GURU is concerned, I’m not sold. It couldn’t keep up with SPY during the past year. I know one year isn’t really long enough for a fair comparison. Comparing SPY to GURU since it launched June 2012, GURU gained 95% and SPY gained 99.9%. I can’t find a reason to justify owning GURU over SPY. There doesn’t seem to be a major advantage to how GURU picks its portfolio of 60 stocks. If you’re looking for something you can set and forget, there’s plenty of money to be made on index funds. I was not compensated by the companies mentioned in this port.",Titan does have integration with TurboTax through Apex Clearing.

The chart compares the value of my Titan account, GURU value, GURU share price, and share price of SPY ETF. 5/22/2018 11/23/2018 5/22/2019 Titan $1000 $965.95 $1113.4 -3.40% 11.30% GURU value $1000.32 $946.88 $1025.6 GURU $31.26 $29.59 $32.05 -5.30% 2.50% SPY $270.94 $263.25 $285.63 -2.80% 5.40% Titan earned 11% in value, GURU only gained 2.5%, while SPY gained 5.3%. All of those gains have evaporated as the market takes a giant deuce. Here are the values from the 5-22-18 to last Friday. I’m at a rough break even with Titan, and GURU is down 1.7%. I expect the retraction to be temporary. BTFD 5/22/2018 5/31/2019 Titan $1000 $998.53 -0.10% GURU value $1000.32 $983.36 GURU $31.26 $30.73 -1.70% SPY $270.94 $275.27 1.60% With the dip in the market, I’ve decided to add an additional $4k to Titan. I’m happy with the performance so far, and the interface is pretty slick. The regular digests make for good talking points that help me look like I’m on top of current events. When I first opened an account with Titan there was a promotion for zero fee on balances up to $1k, so no fee was deducted during the past year. My fee waiver is now expired, but a 1% fee will only cost me about $50 for the year. Not the end of the world. If I convince a friend to open an account, we both get our fees discounted by 0.25%. Four referrals earn me zero fee forever. I’m not going to publicly post my code here per the rules. If you have questions keep it out of the comments and DM me. I wish Titan offered Turbotax integration. I almost threw my computer out the window adding the 1099 information manually. The forms were easy to download from Titan, but the interface in Turbotax to enter the numbers was utter garbage. I understand minimum viable product and everything, but I’m dumbfounded that a cutting edge fintech software company doesn’t have this. Apparently there was a way to do this with an Apex account that I didn’t learn about until after I filed. As far as GURU is concerned, I’m not sold. It couldn’t keep up with SPY during the past year. I know one year isn’t really long enough for a fair comparison. Comparing SPY to GURU since it launched June 2012, GURU gained 95% and SPY gained 99.9%. I can’t find a reason to justify owning GURU over SPY. There doesn’t seem to be a major advantage to how GURU picks its portfolio of 60 stocks. If you’re looking for something you can set and forget, there’s plenty of money to be made on index funds. I was not compensated by the companies mentioned in this port.",im considering investing in titan. what are your returns now for all three (8/22/2019)?,0,0.516,1.0,NEGATIVE
