,"I'm debating on which companies to add to my portfolio. I'm trying to choose between cloud and cybersecurity high growth but often unprofitable or barely profitable companies like Okta, Twilio, TEAM, Servicenow, Veeva. And between classic low growth but predictable companies like Target, Visa, Estee Lauder, Home Depot, Mcdonalds, McCormick etc. The growth of the newer cloud companies blows the other companies out the water; however, the software lifecycle worries me. Will any of these companies be around more than 3 yrs? A lot of them seem really niche too. The other companies have fewer downswings, but almost nonexistant revenue and slow stock price share growth compared to cloud companies. However, these are dominant companies that control a large market share or have monopolies in their industries. Whereas the other companies maybe control 3% of a niche market at the most. I'm younger so I need to focus more on growth, but I'm a long term investor and a lot of these cloud companies Buffett wouldn't touch. However, maybe current times are different than from when Buffett started. What do you all think growth cloud or predictable blue chip?","I own several mid-sized SaaS names, with some of the purchases having been done in November/December 2018. I think there's a very strong future for a lot of these companies, but I think it does become really asking yourself whether the product is mission critical/has some sort of a moat. Does it save the customer significant time/money? Read reviews, what do users say?I think that there's also a balancing act with owning names like these and not going overboard in your allocation to them. These names did exceptionally well in the first half of 2019 and were absolutely obliterated in the rotation out of growth in the Fall of last year. They have done well (and in some cases exceedingly well) again in the last month or so (see AYX) and I'm sure there will probably be at least a mild pullback again at some point. If you are going to buy these names, I'd be at least somewhat patient/cautious as to when - in other words, I wouldn't say buy AYX +30% in a month.You talk about growth cloud or blue chip -I don't see why it can't be some of one and some of the other. I definitely would not want my portfolio to be heavily reliant upon small-mid SaaS for one with the volatility and two, there's a lot of other things i'm interested in.",0,0.541,0.979,NEGATIVE

What do you all think growth cloud or predictable blue chip?",I invest 70% to world index and 30% to growth cloud/cyber security stocks. On the long term the difference between index vs blue chips wont be too much probably. Index/blue chips are of course safer than cloud stocks.Most of the SaaS stocks have products that are hard to replace easily. It takes too much money and time because usually they are so integrated into the companys own infrastucture once deployed.,0,0.536,0.982,NEGATIVE

What do you all think growth cloud or predictable blue chip?",You are considering some massively different approaches to investing. Reason out what you are looking for and bring your considerations closer together.Between your two extremes is most of the market. Why not buy an index and have it all covered? It is a great move for the long term. Holding individual stocks means keeping up with the news and not hesitating to move things around.,0,0.54,0.996,POSITIVE

What do you all think growth cloud or predictable blue chip?","Some of those cloud companies you mentioned are not even profitable yet trading at high valuations. All the charts have had extreme spikes the past 3 years and makes you wonder if it can keep going. Service now seems like a good company but up like 40% since October at $320 now. Even McCormicks, one of those stodgy old companies my dad liked to own for a good dividend has gone through the roof the past 5 years. I continue to believe that MKC is best-in-breed, but I'm not willing to chase the momentum and buy shares at this level. Cloud companies will get eaten up by Microsoft, google, baba. Buffet is a multibillionaire, he only likes his blue chips and I think he has done ok. In 08 when things tanked, he bought hard right away. keep cash on the side.",0,0.541,1.0,NEGATIVE
