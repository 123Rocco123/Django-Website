,"I've read the most important thing by Howard Marks, and he suggests investing in undervalued stocks because they have less risk, will drop less, and are more consistant. Also, no stock is so good that it can be bought too high, and often low quality companies are a better investment than quality companies that are overvalued, because their price is bid up so high that it lowers the return and increases risk because these companies are less consistent with market cycle fluctuations. He also says that the top thing investors should do is minimize losses almost like a batting average. However, Philip Fisher in Common Stocks and Uncommon profits suggests that bargain stocks may have business troubles and that's the reason they're valued so low. Also, it could take years for an undervalued stock to adjust, and that growth stocks should be used by investors because they will increase earnings the greatest, they have better profit margins, and growth stocks have a higher value because they are superbly managed. So, is growth or value better long term. It does seem that the growth companies are much better ex: Visa, Msft, Shopify, Tesla, Okta, Paypal, Square, but their valuations are so crazy high that even the coronavirus fears hardly brought down their PE. Or are value stocks better ex: hanes, big lots, halliburton, LMT, PFE, Citibank, a lot of financial stocks, beaten down oil stocks etc. A lot of these stocks are beaten down and probably won't rise much, but have good dividends. And the growth stocks listed above will rise a lot more, but Marks said something that is overvalued can't be overvalued forever. But won't the value stocks drop in a recession too, and a lot of value companies have huge financial troubles, low earnings, or are slow moving stalwarts with no growth. What do you all think is better then long term value or growth?","People want to wear this sort of value investing badge with pride, but the issue IMO is that people think everything ""down a lot"" is a ""value."" There's been so many instances of crap that has declined massively in recent years for a reason where people aren't looking at the business itself and not looking forward, only just viewing names through the lens of various valuation metrics. It's like the people who were going on about Gamestop being ""so cheap"" in the teens with ""that yield and single digit p/e"" or Bed Bath trading ""below book"" at $20. I think actual, compelling value situations where it's a quality business that is for some reason out of favor are few-and-far-between and in recent years, there's been a ton of things that have been mentioned as ""values"" that are really ""value traps"" that are down for legitimate reasons (and reasons that often aren't transitory.)I am firmly in the growth camp and I will tell you that I am far less stressed with an aggressive growth portfolio of names where I have a long-term thesis than I would be trying to have a value portfolio. That's just me.I'm not against value entirely, but value situations that interest me are few-and-far-between (and generally seem to revolve around real estate-related names.)""value stocks drop in a recession too""Growth names have been remarkably resilient during this - value didn't provide any safety and in many cases did worse. A lot of that for various reasons, but people going on about oil stocks: yes, they're going to bounce back some if oil does - but before this, in many cases you had nearly a decade of mediocrity. I'd rather own something that is going to bounce back and actually then have some real growth on the other side of this."" valuations are so crazy high""I don't own it anymore, but I read about a thousand times ""it's too expensive"" about Amazon during the few years that I owned it. I think people have this random level that they often seem to apply to everything that ""it's above (fill in the blank #) p/e! Too expensive!"" That's fine, but just know you're not going to participate in growth stocks.""good dividends.""A 4% yield with a stock that has been mediocre for a decade in an industry without much growth is massively unappealing to me. There is such a focus on dividends in this sub over the last year and people buying things with yields in the teens like mortgage REITs where they don't have a thesis beyond the dividend yield. Then something happens and the stocks implode and the dividend is cut and they have no idea why because they didn't buy it for what it is, just what it yielded.If you are buying something that has a dividend, if you don't have a thesis for the actual company itself and wouldn't buy the stock if there wasn't a dividend, don't buy it. Don't yield chase, don't prioritize what the dividend yield is. Buying something for the yield only and not focused on the company itself is how Ford has been a topic on here for years as it has gone from the teens to $10 to $7 and now under $5.",0,0.539,0.99,NEGATIVE

However, the value factor produces a positive return, although it takes decades for the premium to appear.Growth stocks are safer because they are expected to perform well. Overvaluation is a common trait among growth stocks.The research on the value factor has been out for a while - long term it's better. But it adds complexity to your portfolio.
