,Is it overpriced by now?,"I'm a fan. That being said there are definitely cheaper options out there if you're holding for a short time. If you are planning on holding for a while (over a year) then I'd say buy. They have over half the market share, their profit margin is around 50%, and they have +65,000 transactions per second. Kind of crazy when you think about it.",0,0.605,0.9,POSITIVE
,Is it overpriced by now?,"What does that mean in terms of growth, though?",1,0.555,0.855,POSITIVE
,Is it overpriced by now?,"""Growth in the US, the UK, and China drove most of the growth difference versus last quarter. As you saw in the numbers reported by the US banks over the last two weeks, processing days and the shift of Easter impacted the numbers. That said volume growth in many markets around the world was still quite attractive. Growth in our CEMEA region was 22%, and Latin America grew 14%. Also sub-regions like India, Southeast Asia, Central Europe and Eastern Europe, all were growing at mid-teens or better. Processed transaction growth was 11%, consistent with last quarter. Growth remained strong in our large tap to pay markets such as Australia, Canada and the UK.""This is a bit from the earnings call yesterday.",2,0.571,0.864,POSITIVE

,Is it overpriced by now?,I think they have a huge market potential as Africa begins to modernize along with other large areas visa should do very well. Not sure of the percentage but a bug chunk of plastic is people's wallets are visa.,0,0.526,1.0,NEGATIVE
,Is it overpriced by now?,Depends on how long you want to hold it.If you’re not looking at holding for a long time then yeah it’s quite expensive but not overpriced. It’s the highest it’s ever been in it’s time though.But if you want to hold it for longer than 5-10 years then buying at this price now isn’t too bad for the company you’re getting.Not to mention that Visa and MasterCard are near monopolies in the credit card world.,0,0.539,0.996,POSITIVE
,Is it overpriced by now?,"But there’s also a whole another world outside of the credit card world. China is skipping it entirely, and are expanding their own network aggressively across asia. If you ever travel to asia, you’ll see their payment options along with visa/mastercard at every merchant. So Visa’s growth is definitely not unchallenged. I do own V but wanted to present another side to this.",1,0.528,0.881,NEGATIVE
,Is it overpriced by now?,"That’s pretty interesting I had no idea about China’s own credit card network.Visa definitely is a fundamentally strong company that, again, like you said their growth is not unchallenged however it would interesting to see in the years to come how they compare against the China approach.",2,0.585,0.994,POSITIVE
