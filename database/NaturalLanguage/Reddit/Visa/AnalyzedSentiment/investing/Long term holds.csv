Just know that shares can run from 2K to much higher and dip - but never reach these levels again. Who knows, but important to know the opportunity cost in trying to time that entry.",4,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE

I am risk tolerant and want to move beyond ETF investing. Time frame 25 years. Thoughts?","I want 6 holdings.Why? I was originally going to say dump all of them and just hold AAPL. You'll probably make more money that way, but then again, maybe not. Six stocks isn't enough to give you diversification, so you might as well bet it all on one. Also, five is a good as six.BRK.B is great, but since your picks have a growth tilt, why not go for something growthier? Like NVDA? Or DATA? Or AKAM?I don't like Walmart because I don't like the retailing industry in general.",2,0.527,0.983,NEGATIVE

I am risk tolerant and want to move beyond ETF investing. Time frame 25 years. Thoughts?","I'd guess its because stocks outside of those ETF's are going to be much smaller, and require a lot more research to understand.OP isn't shooting for the moon here, they're still making some pretty risk adverse picks. Just probably seeking to capture some more gain, and honestly, taper down the risk, as those holdings should make it through a future downturn intact.In fact, OP seems to mirror me.I've to two ETF portfolios, and chose to directly hold shares in a few companies that i thought could power through a future slowdown. Those companies? Apple, Disney, Microsoft, AT&T, Bank of America and IBM. As my speculative pick, I also added shares of Elastic NV (ESTC).I know ATT and IBM aren't very well loved, but the first has assembled a media empire that's comparable to Disney (and outstrips Netflix), is one of the largest cell carriers in the US, and pays a hefty dividend while servicing their debt. Since it's in a tax-deferred account, i don't care about the tax implications of the dividend",1,0.521,0.999,NEGATIVE

Thoughts?","I'd guess its because stocks outside of those ETF's are going to be much smaller, and require a lot more research to understand.Not necessarily. Maybe OP is 100% US, in which case a blue chip EU stock with an ADR could be a good pick.Just probably seeking to capture some more gainOr loss ... but sure, which is why I posed it as a question. Too often I see people in this sub accidentally concentrating on a company or sector because they don't realize they have overlap. If it's intentional, that's fine. There's a low probability of success, but that didn't stop me from buying individual stocks either. ;)",2,0.535,1.0,NEGATIVE

,"Have additional 54k US to invest. Would a long term hold of 9k each of apple , Microsoft , visa , MasterCard , Disney and Walmart be solid ? I am risk tolerant and want to move beyond ETF investing. Time frame 25 years. Thoughts?","So, a couple things:(1) When I say use leverage, I mean it broadly construed. You can create synthetic leverage via the use of futures contracts, for instance.(2) When you say ""not suitable for the long-term investing"", that is certainly true under some strategies but it may be fine under others. Read the prospectus for SSO -- understand how it functions and whether it suits your needs. The ""daily return"" feature of these types of funds is why people can shy away from them (because they will not perfectly mirror an e.g. 2x performance of the index over a period).",4,0.518,0.967,NEGATIVE

,"Have additional 54k US to invest. Would a long term hold of 9k each of apple , Microsoft , visa , MasterCard , Disney and Walmart be solid ? I am risk tolerant and want to move beyond ETF investing. Time frame 25 years. Thoughts?","Do not take the risks of daily levered ETF's lightly. They look great in the hindsight of a 10 year bull market, but if volatility returns or worse, the market has a protracted correction or decline, these will be ruinous.One advantage is that the leverage is inside the ETF, so you're not out on margin. But that's about it. IF you think the market is going upwards for another 5 years, then maybe you could buy these (contrary to even the advice of the company that created them), but if you want something more defensive (which i think is your goal from the rest of your portfolio), this is not what you want.",6,0.556,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Have additional 54k US to invest. Would a long term hold of 9k each of apple , Microsoft , visa , MasterCard , Disney and Walmart be solid ? I am risk tolerant and want to move beyond ETF investing. Time frame 25 years. Thoughts?","Don’t go long term on leveraged ETFs. They reset daily and track the % so you get into trouble with what I’m just gonna call the law of multiples. The stock market can go up 20% in a year and a 2x you’d expect 40 but just not the case due to volatility. A wild example I’ll use just for the sake of easy math but a market can go sideways by going up 25% and down 20% back and forth. 2x leveraged would go up 50% and down 40. Or 100 to 150 then to 90. Basically anytime the market has volatility your returns are getting killed in a leveraged etf due to daily resetting.I’d actually just recommend a long term margin loan. The high risk is the call when your assets have to be sold off to cover the loan but you can avoid this by taking smaller leverage. 1.5x would be pretty safe leverage imo, especially if you make monthly contributions. IB does a loan rate of a little over 3%. Over time theoretically your margin will decrease as the market goes up and you can decide to releverage to 1.5 or whatever you like again.So leverage is really good, resetting daily isn’t.",2,0.529,0.999,NEGATIVE
