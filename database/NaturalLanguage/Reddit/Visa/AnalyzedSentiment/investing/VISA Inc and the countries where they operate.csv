,"I have been attempting to do some basic DD on VISA. Upon learning that they operate in over 200 countries, I am finding it extremely difficult to ascertain online all county's where they operate in any compacity. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to go about this for VISA or any other company?","Might be easier to get a list of the countries where they *don't* operate, yes?P.S. ""Conventional Wisdom"", i.e. Wikipedia, says there are 195 recognised countries in the world today.(I think there were like 104 back when Dag Hammarsk√∂ld was Secretary-General of the UN.)",0,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.934

Some places there might be really limited adoption but I think it would be hard to find a country that isn't under sanctions that is not served by Visa. Or maybe the Holy See because there isn't really anything to buy there.Also: the places that Visa doesn't operate in are basically a rounding error in the global economy.",1,0.519,NEGATIVE,1.0

There are a number of countries (for instance, Belarus, Russia) where foreign issued cards don't work due to sanctions but I suppose Visa would still technically say they are served by Visa as they might use domestic-bank issued Visa cards.",0,0.52,NEGATIVE,1.0

Depends on the company, but I believe SEC regulation is lax on subsidiary reporting; and companies that don't necessarily want to report a ""significant"" subsidiary don't really need to. OpenCorporates is a really great resource imo. They crawl state and country registers to get info on affiliates.",0,0.54,POSITIVE,0.893
