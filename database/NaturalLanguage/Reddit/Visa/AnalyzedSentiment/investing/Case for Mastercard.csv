,"I hear a lot about how people like Visa, in which I also think is really good, it's a great business with future prospects and fair enough returns. However, although Visa has a more dominant position in the market, I think MasterCard is also a great quality buy. First of all, it's a pretty similar business to Visa, the source of MasterCard's wide economic moat is it's network effect. As more individuals use it, more merchants accept it, every additional user creates value. So it earns a wide moat. Also, it will be surfing the wave of how society is becoming even more cashless and how consumer spending is constantly increasing. And I'm thinking that the scale of Visa or MasterCard is pretty hard to match. MA also generates a CROIC 46% of and a ROIC of around 35% All in all, i think MA will be able to grow with their business model and generate sufficient returns above their cost of capital.","I agree, I think mastercard has some room to grow. As far as I can tell, I've never seen it not be accepted vs Visa.",0,0.512,0.999,NEGATIVE

It does not have the kind of dominant market share that Visa has, but is certainly worth consideration, too.",0,0.554,0.999,POSITIVE
