They don’t credit cards, they charge for access to a line of credit. I think access to credit lines would still be necessary in a world of bitcoin as the dominant store of value.These are big companies with smart mf’s making the decisions. These companies know WAY more about what’s doing on than Joe-schmo with internet access researching bitcoin. They also have nearly endless resources to pour i to pivoting their business to capitalize on changing landscape (like the BTC credit cards you mentioned). They will continue to find ways to skim $ off economic transactions and facilitate new ways to execute transactions that we can’t imagine.We aren’t going to default to bitcoin overnight for any given reason.... they have plenty of time to figure it out.My opinions only",0,0.528,0.719,NEGATIVE
