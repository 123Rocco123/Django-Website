,"I decided to take a look at the holdings of the US Total Market fund that Vanguard offers and I was shocked to see tangible book value dropping for so many of the top stocks! Tons of the top holdings have lower tangible book value in 2018 than in 2015! Why is tangible book value dropping for these profitable companies?! Are they making terrible acquisitions? This actually makes me pretty nervous about holding these companies. I thought companies should be growing book value over time if they are profitable and not paying everything out in dividends/buybacks? Examples: MSFT: 58.3 billion in 2015, 38.9 billion in 2018.

What is going on?","Many of these companies have been holding assets and cash overseas to avoid taxes. Now that the tax structure has changed they are repatriating that cash and doing capital return or paying down debt they took up to get access to US cash without repatriating their foreign earnings. You would expect this to be a time of adjustment for that reason, look up longer term trends including back to and before the last “tax holiday” to see if this is the only factor or if there are other effects that need to be considered.",0,0.526,0.886,NEGATIVE

Just adding a bit here.In the context of OP's post and the resulting discussion, we are looking at companies that raise debt strictly to sustain their dividend. Companies tap the credit markets all the time, and by looking at only whether or not they do to determine whether or not their dividend is being supported by debt is a bit naive.If you are using your suggested method, then any company that has debt is using it to support a dividend. That line of thought just isn't pragmatic. I backdated the yields at the time so AAPL put up 10 year bonds at around 3.1%. This isn't exactly a junk bond that is being floated around where AAPL is struggling to maintain a dividend.",4,0.541,1.0,NEGATIVE

This actually makes me pretty nervous about holding these companies. I thought companies should be growing book value over time if they are profitable and not paying everything out in dividends/buybacks? Examples: MSFT: 58.3 billion in 2015, 38.9 billion in 2018. AAPL: 110.3 billion in 2015, 107.1 billion in 2018. JNJ: 23.7 billion in 2015, NEGATIVE 18.3 billion in 2018. VISA: 6 billion in 2015, NEGATIVE 15.2 billion in 2018. PG: Negative 8.2 billion in 2015, negative 17.7 billion in 2018. CSCO: 32.8 billion in 2015, 8.9 billion in 2018. PFE: Negative 23.9 billion in 2015, negative 25.2 billion in 2018. MA: 3.3 billion in 2015, 1.5 billion in 2018. I could obviously go on and on down the list but roughly half the companies in the top 30 holdings (which makes up a huge percentage of the total market) have been LOSING tangible book value over the last four years.
