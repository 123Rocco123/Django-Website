,"Schwab brokerage account locked for 44 days, banned from TD Ameritrade Forgive me if I am posting in the wrong sub I'll start with Charles Schwab. I had around $300 in my Schwab brokerage account. I wanted to use another brokerage besides Robinhood so I made transfers from my bank account to start out. Then on December 27th, I started a transfer of $3000 from my Bank of America account to my Charles Schwab brokerage account. The Schwab account was then suspended for suspicious activity on December 29th. I called Schwab on December 30th, and they told me that the fraud department is investigating, and it can take 3-5 business days, maybe longer because it was the holiday season. I said OK, called back a week later, and they said the same thing, called another week later, they said the same thing again. Called them about 5 or 6 times, and they always say that they need 3 to 4 or 3 to 5 business days to investigate. Well, it's now January 27 and my account is still locked for suspicious activity. When I try to ask them what they are investigating, they will never tell me. How can I get access to my money? Does it usually take this long? If i do nothing, how long would it take to complete the investigation? months, years? Is it legal for them to hold my money for this long? TD Ameritrade https://i.imgur.com/xjScClZ.jpg I got a letter in the mail that I have been banned from TD Ameritrade. I created an account with them on December 26th and this letter is from the 29th saying that their business relationship with me has been terminated, and they will not change this decision, and I am basically banned from using them in the future. It seemed that I was banned for an unknown reason; they won't tell me, so at this point, I have more questions than answers. The only guess I have is because Schwab bought TD Ameritrade, so they are trying to prevent me from using both? IDK EDIT: Contacted Schwab early this morning because if I call later in the day, I will be on hold for 2 hours. They said that the fraud department hasn't updated my case since the 14th of January so they are not sure what is going on. They put my case as urgent and said that I should get a call today or tomorrow. I'll give them another week because they are probably going to drag this one out; if I don't hear back from them I'm going to file a federal complaint. EDIT2: Just filed a federal complaint through CFPB for my Charles Schwab account. Hopefully, my account gets unlocked or funds reimbursed to me. CFPB says maybe up to 15 days; that's fine considering I've already been waiting 43 days now. EDIT3: So, the company Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. claimed on the federal complaint that the complaint doesn't belong to their company. What?!? I'll keep updating the post when I get more information. EDIT4: 51 Days. CFPB closed my complaint and told me to contact FINRA. I have submitted a complaint to FINRA. Let's see what happens. PROBLEM SOLVED EDIT 5: March 1, I get an email from Charles Schwab regarding my account. They finally closed my account after 61 days. I immediately make an account and transfer the funds, which are transferred on March 5 (Day 66). Finally, I have access to my money and can invest at Fidelity. I just wish it didn't take 66 days :( Final Edit: I will post the reply that Schwab sent me regarding the FINRA Complaint that was sent in a letter. ""March 17, 2021"" ""Dear Mr."" ""____________ of FINRA forwarded your complaint on February 23, 2021, and requested that Charles Schwab & Co., Inc ('""Schwab"" or ""the Firm"") respond directly to your concerns.

,"Schwab brokerage account locked for 44 days, banned from TD Ameritrade Forgive me if I am posting in the wrong sub I'll start with Charles Schwab. I had around $300 in my Schwab brokerage account. I wanted to use another brokerage besides Robinhood so I made transfers from my bank account to start out. Then on December 27th, I started a transfer of $3000 from my Bank of America account to my Charles Schwab brokerage account. The Schwab account was then suspended for suspicious activity on December 29th. I called Schwab on December 30th, and they told me that the fraud department is investigating, and it can take 3-5 business days, maybe longer because it was the holiday season. I said OK, called back a week later, and they said the same thing, called another week later, they said the same thing again. Called them about 5 or 6 times, and they always say that they need 3 to 4 or 3 to 5 business days to investigate. Well, it's now January 27 and my account is still locked for suspicious activity. When I try to ask them what they are investigating, they will never tell me. How can I get access to my money? Does it usually take this long? If i do nothing, how long would it take to complete the investigation? months, years? Is it legal for them to hold my money for this long? TD Ameritrade https://i.imgur.com/xjScClZ.jpg I got a letter in the mail that I have been banned from TD Ameritrade. I created an account with them on December 26th and this letter is from the 29th saying that their business relationship with me has been terminated, and they will not change this decision, and I am basically banned from using them in the future. It seemed that I was banned for an unknown reason; they won't tell me, so at this point, I have more questions than answers. The only guess I have is because Schwab bought TD Ameritrade, so they are trying to prevent me from using both? IDK EDIT: Contacted Schwab early this morning because if I call later in the day, I will be on hold for 2 hours. They said that the fraud department hasn't updated my case since the 14th of January so they are not sure what is going on. They put my case as urgent and said that I should get a call today or tomorrow. I'll give them another week because they are probably going to drag this one out; if I don't hear back from them I'm going to file a federal complaint. EDIT2: Just filed a federal complaint through CFPB for my Charles Schwab account. Hopefully, my account gets unlocked or funds reimbursed to me. CFPB says maybe up to 15 days; that's fine considering I've already been waiting 43 days now. EDIT3: So, the company Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. claimed on the federal complaint that the complaint doesn't belong to their company. What?!? I'll keep updating the post when I get more information.

When I try to ask them what they are investigating, they will never tell me. How can I get access to my money? Does it usually take this long? If i do nothing, how long would it take to complete the investigation? months, years? Is it legal for them to hold my money for this long? TD Ameritrade https://i.imgur.com/xjScClZ.jpg I got a letter in the mail that I have been banned from TD Ameritrade. I created an account with them on December 26th and this letter is from the 29th saying that their business relationship with me has been terminated, and they will not change this decision, and I am basically banned from using them in the future. It seemed that I was banned for an unknown reason; they won't tell me, so at this point, I have more questions than answers. The only guess I have is because Schwab bought TD Ameritrade, so they are trying to prevent me from using both? IDK EDIT: Contacted Schwab early this morning because if I call later in the day, I will be on hold for 2 hours. They said that the fraud department hasn't updated my case since the 14th of January so they are not sure what is going on. They put my case as urgent and said that I should get a call today or tomorrow. I'll give them another week because they are probably going to drag this one out; if I don't hear back from them I'm going to file a federal complaint. EDIT2: Just filed a federal complaint through CFPB for my Charles Schwab account. Hopefully, my account gets unlocked or funds reimbursed to me. CFPB says maybe up to 15 days; that's fine considering I've already been waiting 43 days now. EDIT3: So, the company Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. claimed on the federal complaint that the complaint doesn't belong to their company. What?!? I'll keep updating the post when I get more information. EDIT4: 51 Days. CFPB closed my complaint and told me to contact FINRA. I have submitted a complaint to FINRA. Let's see what happens.

,"Schwab brokerage account locked for 44 days, banned from TD Ameritrade Forgive me if I am posting in the wrong sub I'll start with Charles Schwab. I had around $300 in my Schwab brokerage account. I wanted to use another brokerage besides Robinhood so I made transfers from my bank account to start out. Then on December 27th, I started a transfer of $3000 from my Bank of America account to my Charles Schwab brokerage account. The Schwab account was then suspended for suspicious activity on December 29th. I called Schwab on December 30th, and they told me that the fraud department is investigating, and it can take 3-5 business days, maybe longer because it was the holiday season. I said OK, called back a week later, and they said the same thing, called another week later, they said the same thing again. Called them about 5 or 6 times, and they always say that they need 3 to 4 or 3 to 5 business days to investigate. Well, it's now January 27 and my account is still locked for suspicious activity. When I try to ask them what they are investigating, they will never tell me. How can I get access to my money? Does it usually take this long? If i do nothing, how long would it take to complete the investigation? months, years? Is it legal for them to hold my money for this long? TD Ameritrade https://i.imgur.com/xjScClZ.jpg I got a letter in the mail that I have been banned from TD Ameritrade. I created an account with them on December 26th and this letter is from the 29th saying that their business relationship with me has been terminated, and they will not change this decision, and I am basically banned from using them in the future. It seemed that I was banned for an unknown reason; they won't tell me, so at this point, I have more questions than answers. The only guess I have is because Schwab bought TD Ameritrade, so they are trying to prevent me from using both? IDK EDIT: Contacted Schwab early this morning because if I call later in the day, I will be on hold for 2 hours. They said that the fraud department hasn't updated my case since the 14th of January so they are not sure what is going on. They put my case as urgent and said that I should get a call today or tomorrow. I'll give them another week because they are probably going to drag this one out; if I don't hear back from them I'm going to file a federal complaint. EDIT2: Just filed a federal complaint through CFPB for my Charles Schwab account. Hopefully, my account gets unlocked or funds reimbursed to me. CFPB says maybe up to 15 days; that's fine considering I've already been waiting 43 days now. EDIT3: So, the company Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. claimed on the federal complaint that the complaint doesn't belong to their company. What?!? I'll keep updating the post when I get more information.

If i do nothing, how long would it take to complete the investigation? months, years? Is it legal for them to hold my money for this long? TD Ameritrade https://i.imgur.com/xjScClZ.jpg I got a letter in the mail that I have been banned from TD Ameritrade. I created an account with them on December 26th and this letter is from the 29th saying that their business relationship with me has been terminated, and they will not change this decision, and I am basically banned from using them in the future. It seemed that I was banned for an unknown reason; they won't tell me, so at this point, I have more questions than answers. The only guess I have is because Schwab bought TD Ameritrade, so they are trying to prevent me from using both? IDK EDIT: Contacted Schwab early this morning because if I call later in the day, I will be on hold for 2 hours. They said that the fraud department hasn't updated my case since the 14th of January so they are not sure what is going on. They put my case as urgent and said that I should get a call today or tomorrow. I'll give them another week because they are probably going to drag this one out; if I don't hear back from them I'm going to file a federal complaint. EDIT2: Just filed a federal complaint through CFPB for my Charles Schwab account. Hopefully, my account gets unlocked or funds reimbursed to me. CFPB says maybe up to 15 days; that's fine considering I've already been waiting 43 days now. EDIT3: So, the company Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. claimed on the federal complaint that the complaint doesn't belong to their company. What?!? I'll keep updating the post when I get more information.

,"Schwab brokerage account locked for 44 days, banned from TD Ameritrade Forgive me if I am posting in the wrong sub I'll start with Charles Schwab. I had around $300 in my Schwab brokerage account. I wanted to use another brokerage besides Robinhood so I made transfers from my bank account to start out. Then on December 27th, I started a transfer of $3000 from my Bank of America account to my Charles Schwab brokerage account. The Schwab account was then suspended for suspicious activity on December 29th. I called Schwab on December 30th, and they told me that the fraud department is investigating, and it can take 3-5 business days, maybe longer because it was the holiday season. I said OK, called back a week later, and they said the same thing, called another week later, they said the same thing again. Called them about 5 or 6 times, and they always say that they need 3 to 4 or 3 to 5 business days to investigate. Well, it's now January 27 and my account is still locked for suspicious activity. When I try to ask them what they are investigating, they will never tell me. How can I get access to my money? Does it usually take this long? If i do nothing, how long would it take to complete the investigation? months, years? Is it legal for them to hold my money for this long? TD Ameritrade https://i.imgur.com/xjScClZ.jpg I got a letter in the mail that I have been banned from TD Ameritrade. I created an account with them on December 26th and this letter is from the 29th saying that their business relationship with me has been terminated, and they will not change this decision, and I am basically banned from using them in the future. It seemed that I was banned for an unknown reason; they won't tell me, so at this point, I have more questions than answers. The only guess I have is because Schwab bought TD Ameritrade, so they are trying to prevent me from using both? IDK EDIT: Contacted Schwab early this morning because if I call later in the day, I will be on hold for 2 hours. They said that the fraud department hasn't updated my case since the 14th of January so they are not sure what is going on. They put my case as urgent and said that I should get a call today or tomorrow. I'll give them another week because they are probably going to drag this one out; if I don't hear back from them I'm going to file a federal complaint. EDIT2: Just filed a federal complaint through CFPB for my Charles Schwab account. Hopefully, my account gets unlocked or funds reimbursed to me. CFPB says maybe up to 15 days; that's fine considering I've already been waiting 43 days now.

When I try to ask them what they are investigating, they will never tell me. How can I get access to my money? Does it usually take this long? If i do nothing, how long would it take to complete the investigation? months, years? Is it legal for them to hold my money for this long? TD Ameritrade https://i.imgur.com/xjScClZ.jpg I got a letter in the mail that I have been banned from TD Ameritrade. I created an account with them on December 26th and this letter is from the 29th saying that their business relationship with me has been terminated, and they will not change this decision, and I am basically banned from using them in the future. It seemed that I was banned for an unknown reason; they won't tell me, so at this point, I have more questions than answers. The only guess I have is because Schwab bought TD Ameritrade, so they are trying to prevent me from using both? IDK EDIT: Contacted Schwab early this morning because if I call later in the day, I will be on hold for 2 hours. They said that the fraud department hasn't updated my case since the 14th of January so they are not sure what is going on. They put my case as urgent and said that I should get a call today or tomorrow. I'll give them another week because they are probably going to drag this one out; if I don't hear back from them I'm going to file a federal complaint. EDIT2: Just filed a federal complaint through CFPB for my Charles Schwab account. Hopefully, my account gets unlocked or funds reimbursed to me. CFPB says maybe up to 15 days; that's fine considering I've already been waiting 43 days now. EDIT3: So, the company Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. claimed on the federal complaint that the complaint doesn't belong to their company. What?!? I'll keep updating the post when I get more information. EDIT4: 51 Days. CFPB closed my complaint and told me to contact FINRA. I have submitted a complaint to FINRA. Let's see what happens.

,"Schwab brokerage account locked for 44 days, banned from TD Ameritrade Forgive me if I am posting in the wrong sub I'll start with Charles Schwab. I had around $300 in my Schwab brokerage account. I wanted to use another brokerage besides Robinhood so I made transfers from my bank account to start out. Then on December 27th, I started a transfer of $3000 from my Bank of America account to my Charles Schwab brokerage account. The Schwab account was then suspended for suspicious activity on December 29th. I called Schwab on December 30th, and they told me that the fraud department is investigating, and it can take 3-5 business days, maybe longer because it was the holiday season. I said OK, called back a week later, and they said the same thing, called another week later, they said the same thing again. Called them about 5 or 6 times, and they always say that they need 3 to 4 or 3 to 5 business days to investigate. Well, it's now January 27 and my account is still locked for suspicious activity. When I try to ask them what they are investigating, they will never tell me. How can I get access to my money? Does it usually take this long? If i do nothing, how long would it take to complete the investigation? months, years? Is it legal for them to hold my money for this long? TD Ameritrade https://i.imgur.com/xjScClZ.jpg I got a letter in the mail that I have been banned from TD Ameritrade. I created an account with them on December 26th and this letter is from the 29th saying that their business relationship with me has been terminated, and they will not change this decision, and I am basically banned from using them in the future. It seemed that I was banned for an unknown reason; they won't tell me, so at this point, I have more questions than answers. The only guess I have is because Schwab bought TD Ameritrade, so they are trying to prevent me from using both? IDK EDIT: Contacted Schwab early this morning because if I call later in the day, I will be on hold for 2 hours. They said that the fraud department hasn't updated my case since the 14th of January so they are not sure what is going on. They put my case as urgent and said that I should get a call today or tomorrow. I'll give them another week because they are probably going to drag this one out; if I don't hear back from them I'm going to file a federal complaint. EDIT2: Just filed a federal complaint through CFPB for my Charles Schwab account. Hopefully, my account gets unlocked or funds reimbursed to me. CFPB says maybe up to 15 days; that's fine considering I've already been waiting 43 days now. EDIT3: So, the company Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. claimed on the federal complaint that the complaint doesn't belong to their company. What?!? I'll keep updating the post when I get more information.

They put my case as urgent and said that I should get a call today or tomorrow. I'll give them another week because they are probably going to drag this one out; if I don't hear back from them I'm going to file a federal complaint. EDIT2: Just filed a federal complaint through CFPB for my Charles Schwab account. Hopefully, my account gets unlocked or funds reimbursed to me. CFPB says maybe up to 15 days; that's fine considering I've already been waiting 43 days now. EDIT3: So, the company Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. claimed on the federal complaint that the complaint doesn't belong to their company. What?!? I'll keep updating the post when I get more information.

,"Schwab brokerage account locked for 44 days, banned from TD Ameritrade Forgive me if I am posting in the wrong sub I'll start with Charles Schwab. I had around $300 in my Schwab brokerage account. I wanted to use another brokerage besides Robinhood so I made transfers from my bank account to start out. Then on December 27th, I started a transfer of $3000 from my Bank of America account to my Charles Schwab brokerage account. The Schwab account was then suspended for suspicious activity on December 29th. I called Schwab on December 30th, and they told me that the fraud department is investigating, and it can take 3-5 business days, maybe longer because it was the holiday season. I said OK, called back a week later, and they said the same thing, called another week later, they said the same thing again. Called them about 5 or 6 times, and they always say that they need 3 to 4 or 3 to 5 business days to investigate. Well, it's now January 27 and my account is still locked for suspicious activity. When I try to ask them what they are investigating, they will never tell me. How can I get access to my money? Does it usually take this long? If i do nothing, how long would it take to complete the investigation? months, years? Is it legal for them to hold my money for this long? TD Ameritrade https://i.imgur.com/xjScClZ.jpg I got a letter in the mail that I have been banned from TD Ameritrade. I created an account with them on December 26th and this letter is from the 29th saying that their business relationship with me has been terminated, and they will not change this decision, and I am basically banned from using them in the future. It seemed that I was banned for an unknown reason; they won't tell me, so at this point, I have more questions than answers. The only guess I have is because Schwab bought TD Ameritrade, so they are trying to prevent me from using both? IDK EDIT: Contacted Schwab early this morning because if I call later in the day, I will be on hold for 2 hours. They said that the fraud department hasn't updated my case since the 14th of January so they are not sure what is going on. They put my case as urgent and said that I should get a call today or tomorrow. I'll give them another week because they are probably going to drag this one out; if I don't hear back from them I'm going to file a federal complaint. EDIT2: Just filed a federal complaint through CFPB for my Charles Schwab account. Hopefully, my account gets unlocked or funds reimbursed to me. CFPB says maybe up to 15 days; that's fine considering I've already been waiting 43 days now.

Anyway, if any of these scenarios is indeed happening, then the company is prohibited from disclosing it or providing any details, thus the lack of info from both.

I created an account with them on December 26th and this letter is from the 29th saying that their business relationship with me has been terminated, and they will not change this decision, and I am basically banned from using them in the future. It seemed that I was banned for an unknown reason; they won't tell me, so at this point, I have more questions than answers. The only guess I have is because Schwab bought TD Ameritrade, so they are trying to prevent me from using both? IDK EDIT: Contacted Schwab early this morning because if I call later in the day, I will be on hold for 2 hours. They said that the fraud department hasn't updated my case since the 14th of January so they are not sure what is going on. They put my case as urgent and said that I should get a call today or tomorrow. I'll give them another week because they are probably going to drag this one out; if I don't hear back from them I'm going to file a federal complaint. EDIT2: Just filed a federal complaint through CFPB for my Charles Schwab account. Hopefully, my account gets unlocked or funds reimbursed to me. CFPB says maybe up to 15 days; that's fine considering I've already been waiting 43 days now. EDIT3: So, the company Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. claimed on the federal complaint that the complaint doesn't belong to their company. What?!? I'll keep updating the post when I get more information. EDIT4: 51 Days. CFPB closed my complaint and told me to contact FINRA. I have submitted a complaint to FINRA. Let's see what happens. PROBLEM SOLVED EDIT 5: March 1, I get an email from Charles Schwab regarding my account. They finally closed my account after 61 days. I immediately make an account and transfer the funds, which are transferred on March 5 (Day 66). Finally, I have access to my money and can invest at Fidelity.

,"Schwab brokerage account locked for 44 days, banned from TD Ameritrade Forgive me if I am posting in the wrong sub I'll start with Charles Schwab. I had around $300 in my Schwab brokerage account. I wanted to use another brokerage besides Robinhood so I made transfers from my bank account to start out. Then on December 27th, I started a transfer of $3000 from my Bank of America account to my Charles Schwab brokerage account. The Schwab account was then suspended for suspicious activity on December 29th. I called Schwab on December 30th, and they told me that the fraud department is investigating, and it can take 3-5 business days, maybe longer because it was the holiday season. I said OK, called back a week later, and they said the same thing, called another week later, they said the same thing again. Called them about 5 or 6 times, and they always say that they need 3 to 4 or 3 to 5 business days to investigate. Well, it's now January 27 and my account is still locked for suspicious activity. When I try to ask them what they are investigating, they will never tell me. How can I get access to my money? Does it usually take this long? If i do nothing, how long would it take to complete the investigation? months, years? Is it legal for them to hold my money for this long? TD Ameritrade https://i.imgur.com/xjScClZ.jpg I got a letter in the mail that I have been banned from TD Ameritrade. I created an account with them on December 26th and this letter is from the 29th saying that their business relationship with me has been terminated, and they will not change this decision, and I am basically banned from using them in the future. It seemed that I was banned for an unknown reason; they won't tell me, so at this point, I have more questions than answers. The only guess I have is because Schwab bought TD Ameritrade, so they are trying to prevent me from using both? IDK EDIT: Contacted Schwab early this morning because if I call later in the day, I will be on hold for 2 hours. They said that the fraud department hasn't updated my case since the 14th of January so they are not sure what is going on. They put my case as urgent and said that I should get a call today or tomorrow. I'll give them another week because they are probably going to drag this one out; if I don't hear back from them I'm going to file a federal complaint. EDIT2: Just filed a federal complaint through CFPB for my Charles Schwab account. Hopefully, my account gets unlocked or funds reimbursed to me. CFPB says maybe up to 15 days; that's fine considering I've already been waiting 43 days now. EDIT3: So, the company Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. claimed on the federal complaint that the complaint doesn't belong to their company. What?!? I'll keep updating the post when I get more information. EDIT4: 51 Days. CFPB closed my complaint and told me to contact FINRA. I have submitted a complaint to FINRA. Let's see what happens.

If i do nothing, how long would it take to complete the investigation? months, years? Is it legal for them to hold my money for this long? TD Ameritrade https://i.imgur.com/xjScClZ.jpg I got a letter in the mail that I have been banned from TD Ameritrade. I created an account with them on December 26th and this letter is from the 29th saying that their business relationship with me has been terminated, and they will not change this decision, and I am basically banned from using them in the future. It seemed that I was banned for an unknown reason; they won't tell me, so at this point, I have more questions than answers. The only guess I have is because Schwab bought TD Ameritrade, so they are trying to prevent me from using both? IDK EDIT: Contacted Schwab early this morning because if I call later in the day, I will be on hold for 2 hours. They said that the fraud department hasn't updated my case since the 14th of January so they are not sure what is going on. They put my case as urgent and said that I should get a call today or tomorrow. I'll give them another week because they are probably going to drag this one out; if I don't hear back from them I'm going to file a federal complaint. EDIT2: Just filed a federal complaint through CFPB for my Charles Schwab account. Hopefully, my account gets unlocked or funds reimbursed to me. CFPB says maybe up to 15 days; that's fine considering I've already been waiting 43 days now. EDIT3: So, the company Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. claimed on the federal complaint that the complaint doesn't belong to their company. What?!? I'll keep updating the post when I get more information. EDIT4: 51 Days. CFPB closed my complaint and told me to contact FINRA. I have submitted a complaint to FINRA. Let's see what happens.

,"Schwab brokerage account locked for 44 days, banned from TD Ameritrade Forgive me if I am posting in the wrong sub I'll start with Charles Schwab. I had around $300 in my Schwab brokerage account. I wanted to use another brokerage besides Robinhood so I made transfers from my bank account to start out. Then on December 27th, I started a transfer of $3000 from my Bank of America account to my Charles Schwab brokerage account. The Schwab account was then suspended for suspicious activity on December 29th. I called Schwab on December 30th, and they told me that the fraud department is investigating, and it can take 3-5 business days, maybe longer because it was the holiday season. I said OK, called back a week later, and they said the same thing, called another week later, they said the same thing again. Called them about 5 or 6 times, and they always say that they need 3 to 4 or 3 to 5 business days to investigate. Well, it's now January 27 and my account is still locked for suspicious activity. When I try to ask them what they are investigating, they will never tell me. How can I get access to my money? Does it usually take this long? If i do nothing, how long would it take to complete the investigation? months, years? Is it legal for them to hold my money for this long? TD Ameritrade https://i.imgur.com/xjScClZ.jpg I got a letter in the mail that I have been banned from TD Ameritrade. I created an account with them on December 26th and this letter is from the 29th saying that their business relationship with me has been terminated, and they will not change this decision, and I am basically banned from using them in the future. It seemed that I was banned for an unknown reason; they won't tell me, so at this point, I have more questions than answers. The only guess I have is because Schwab bought TD Ameritrade, so they are trying to prevent me from using both? IDK EDIT: Contacted Schwab early this morning because if I call later in the day, I will be on hold for 2 hours. They said that the fraud department hasn't updated my case since the 14th of January so they are not sure what is going on. They put my case as urgent and said that I should get a call today or tomorrow. I'll give them another week because they are probably going to drag this one out; if I don't hear back from them I'm going to file a federal complaint. EDIT2: Just filed a federal complaint through CFPB for my Charles Schwab account. Hopefully, my account gets unlocked or funds reimbursed to me. CFPB says maybe up to 15 days; that's fine considering I've already been waiting 43 days now. EDIT3: So, the company Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. claimed on the federal complaint that the complaint doesn't belong to their company. What?!? I'll keep updating the post when I get more information. EDIT4: 51 Days. CFPB closed my complaint and told me to contact FINRA. I have submitted a complaint to FINRA. Let's see what happens. PROBLEM SOLVED EDIT 5: March 1, I get an email from Charles Schwab regarding my account. They finally closed my account after 61 days. I immediately make an account and transfer the funds, which are transferred on March 5 (Day 66). Finally, I have access to my money and can invest at Fidelity. I just wish it didn't take 66 days :( Final Edit: I will post the reply that Schwab sent me regarding the FINRA Complaint that was sent in a letter.

The only guess I have is because Schwab bought TD Ameritrade, so they are trying to prevent me from using both? IDK EDIT: Contacted Schwab early this morning because if I call later in the day, I will be on hold for 2 hours. They said that the fraud department hasn't updated my case since the 14th of January so they are not sure what is going on. They put my case as urgent and said that I should get a call today or tomorrow. I'll give them another week because they are probably going to drag this one out; if I don't hear back from them I'm going to file a federal complaint. EDIT2: Just filed a federal complaint through CFPB for my Charles Schwab account. Hopefully, my account gets unlocked or funds reimbursed to me. CFPB says maybe up to 15 days; that's fine considering I've already been waiting 43 days now. EDIT3: So, the company Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. claimed on the federal complaint that the complaint doesn't belong to their company. What?!? I'll keep updating the post when I get more information. EDIT4: 51 Days. CFPB closed my complaint and told me to contact FINRA. I have submitted a complaint to FINRA. Let's see what happens. PROBLEM SOLVED EDIT 5: March 1, I get an email from Charles Schwab regarding my account. They finally closed my account after 61 days. I immediately make an account and transfer the funds, which are transferred on March 5 (Day 66). Finally, I have access to my money and can invest at Fidelity.

Why not tell the truth and tell me that it will take some months to resolve instead of always saying 3-5 business days? ""Our investigation notes that on December 29, 2020, you deposited $3000 in your Schwab One account.

,"Schwab brokerage account locked for 44 days, banned from TD Ameritrade Forgive me if I am posting in the wrong sub I'll start with Charles Schwab. I had around $300 in my Schwab brokerage account. I wanted to use another brokerage besides Robinhood so I made transfers from my bank account to start out. Then on December 27th, I started a transfer of $3000 from my Bank of America account to my Charles Schwab brokerage account. The Schwab account was then suspended for suspicious activity on December 29th. I called Schwab on December 30th, and they told me that the fraud department is investigating, and it can take 3-5 business days, maybe longer because it was the holiday season. I said OK, called back a week later, and they said the same thing, called another week later, they said the same thing again. Called them about 5 or 6 times, and they always say that they need 3 to 4 or 3 to 5 business days to investigate. Well, it's now January 27 and my account is still locked for suspicious activity. When I try to ask them what they are investigating, they will never tell me. How can I get access to my money? Does it usually take this long? If i do nothing, how long would it take to complete the investigation? months, years? Is it legal for them to hold my money for this long? TD Ameritrade https://i.imgur.com/xjScClZ.jpg I got a letter in the mail that I have been banned from TD Ameritrade. I created an account with them on December 26th and this letter is from the 29th saying that their business relationship with me has been terminated, and they will not change this decision, and I am basically banned from using them in the future. It seemed that I was banned for an unknown reason; they won't tell me, so at this point, I have more questions than answers. The only guess I have is because Schwab bought TD Ameritrade, so they are trying to prevent me from using both? IDK EDIT: Contacted Schwab early this morning because if I call later in the day, I will be on hold for 2 hours. They said that the fraud department hasn't updated my case since the 14th of January so they are not sure what is going on. They put my case as urgent and said that I should get a call today or tomorrow. I'll give them another week because they are probably going to drag this one out; if I don't hear back from them I'm going to file a federal complaint. EDIT2: Just filed a federal complaint through CFPB for my Charles Schwab account. Hopefully, my account gets unlocked or funds reimbursed to me. CFPB says maybe up to 15 days; that's fine considering I've already been waiting 43 days now. EDIT3: So, the company Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. claimed on the federal complaint that the complaint doesn't belong to their company. What?!? I'll keep updating the post when I get more information.

I created an account with them on December 26th and this letter is from the 29th saying that their business relationship with me has been terminated, and they will not change this decision, and I am basically banned from using them in the future. It seemed that I was banned for an unknown reason; they won't tell me, so at this point, I have more questions than answers. The only guess I have is because Schwab bought TD Ameritrade, so they are trying to prevent me from using both? IDK EDIT: Contacted Schwab early this morning because if I call later in the day, I will be on hold for 2 hours. They said that the fraud department hasn't updated my case since the 14th of January so they are not sure what is going on. They put my case as urgent and said that I should get a call today or tomorrow. I'll give them another week because they are probably going to drag this one out; if I don't hear back from them I'm going to file a federal complaint. EDIT2: Just filed a federal complaint through CFPB for my Charles Schwab account. Hopefully, my account gets unlocked or funds reimbursed to me. CFPB says maybe up to 15 days; that's fine considering I've already been waiting 43 days now. EDIT3: So, the company Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. claimed on the federal complaint that the complaint doesn't belong to their company. What?!? I'll keep updating the post when I get more information. EDIT4: 51 Days. CFPB closed my complaint and told me to contact FINRA. I have submitted a complaint to FINRA. Let's see what happens. PROBLEM SOLVED EDIT 5: March 1, I get an email from Charles Schwab regarding my account. They finally closed my account after 61 days. I immediately make an account and transfer the funds, which are transferred on March 5 (Day 66). Finally, I have access to my money and can invest at Fidelity. I just wish it didn't take 66 days :( Final Edit: I will post the reply that Schwab sent me regarding the FINRA Complaint that was sent in a letter. ""March 17, 2021"" ""Dear Mr."" ""____________ of FINRA forwarded your complaint on February 23, 2021, and requested that Charles Schwab & Co., Inc ('""Schwab"" or ""the Firm"") respond directly to your concerns.

Why not tell the truth and tell me that it will take some months to resolve instead of always saying 3-5 business days? ""Our investigation notes that on December 29, 2020, you deposited $3000 in your Schwab One account. On that day, Schwab's Fraud Investigations Department placed a full restriction on your Schwab one account due to potentially fraudulent activity in order to protect you.

,"Schwab brokerage account locked for 44 days, banned from TD Ameritrade Forgive me if I am posting in the wrong sub I'll start with Charles Schwab. I had around $300 in my Schwab brokerage account. I wanted to use another brokerage besides Robinhood so I made transfers from my bank account to start out. Then on December 27th, I started a transfer of $3000 from my Bank of America account to my Charles Schwab brokerage account. The Schwab account was then suspended for suspicious activity on December 29th. I called Schwab on December 30th, and they told me that the fraud department is investigating, and it can take 3-5 business days, maybe longer because it was the holiday season. I said OK, called back a week later, and they said the same thing, called another week later, they said the same thing again. Called them about 5 or 6 times, and they always say that they need 3 to 4 or 3 to 5 business days to investigate. Well, it's now January 27 and my account is still locked for suspicious activity. When I try to ask them what they are investigating, they will never tell me. How can I get access to my money? Does it usually take this long?
