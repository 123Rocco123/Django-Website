,"I am currently working and am on an OPT / F1 visa. I am basically following the concept of the three fund portfolio for a moderate return: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio I was really hoping a robo advisor could take care of this (mixing its own Big / Mid-cap/ REIT / Bonds / International etc.), and Chase's one seemed decent enough. Unfortunately, I was told that my visa status prevents me from having this account be opened. Here is my question. I am able to see the percentages on the robo advisor platform before signing up for it. Could I not buy the funds myself then? Am i paying the 0.35% for the rebalancing? Does it rebalance within the fund itself, or does it just move money around say the bond fund and the BBUS (Chases's VOO equivalent i guess)","Hi, welcome to r/investing.
