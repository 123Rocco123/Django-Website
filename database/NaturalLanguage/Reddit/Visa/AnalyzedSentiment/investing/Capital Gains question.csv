,"I buy one share of Visa on January 1, 2018 I buy a 2nd share on June 1, 2018 I sell one share on January 2, 2019 and make a profit. Would I have to pay the higher capital gains tax rate or the lower?","Depends which share you sold. You elect to sell specific shares, depending on what service you use (fidelity etrade etc), they call them “lots”.So just make sure to sell the share you bought over a year ago.",0,0.568,0.868,NEGATIVE

Most brokerages let you specify a different lot selection for a specific sale overriding whatever the default is. The law requires that your lot selection must be made before or during the sale (not after the sale and before or during tax reporting) and that you explicitly make a choice at some point and that your brokerage has a secure way to record that choice. In case any part of the above is not done then the law requires FIFO. (Your brokerage cannot select a default other than FIFO without your explicit choice).",0,0.518,0.688,NEGATIVE
