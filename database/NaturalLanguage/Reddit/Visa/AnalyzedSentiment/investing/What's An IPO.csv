,"“IPO” stands for Initial Public Offering. When companies decide to “go public,” they sell company shares to outside investors for the first time. The company’s stock is then traded under a unique ticker/symbol on a stock exchange. Both investors and company owners benefit from IPOs. Investors get a piece of the action in the companies they believe have high growth potential. In turn, company owners get paid for selling part of their ownership. IPOs can be useful to raise a substantial amount of money for expansion, increase liquidity, gain credibility and attract interest. They can also be useful exit strategies for founders, private shareholders and equity investors. The process of preparing an offering usually involves an investment banking firm. The firm acts as an underwriter, assessing the value of a company’s shares. Once a company becomes a public company, its financial information also becomes available to the public. Additionally, the company operates under a more regulated environment moving forward. For example, a board of directors must be established to report financial and accounting information. The Roman Republic’s “publicani” were the earliest forms of companies with divided ownership. Company shares were sold to public investors in the Roman Forum and fluctuated in value. Later, the Dutch East India Company carried out the first modern IPO in 1602. The Bank of North America was the first IPO in the United States around the year 1783. Some of the largest IPOs include Visa, General Motors, and Facebook. We don’t usually invest our clients in IPOs, regardless of whether they’re high net-worth or smaller accounts. IPOs are considered high-risk investments, as they’re usually extremely volatile. This is because many institutional investors purchase a large amount of shares at the initial offering price only to sell them back into the market for a quick profit. To be clear, although we don’t typically invest in the initial public offering, we may invest in the company a few months later.",Lol. You don’t invest in IPO because you consider them too risky.So what you are really saying is that your firm isn’t large enough to participate in the underwriting syndicates for IPOs,0,0.512,0.964,NEGATIVE

If you issue public debt you need to fill all the same requirements, but you won't have your equity trade publicly.",0,0.519,0.964,POSITIVE
