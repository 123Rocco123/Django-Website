,"Hi folks, I've been toying with the following idea, and would love to gather feedback. Using, a weight that makes sense for your age e.g. 20-30% of your portfolio (with the rest being in traditional ETFs such as VTI), you'd pick 30-50 stocks that historically are up-only (think Visa), treating it as an ETF. When I buy VOO I certainly don't research all 500 picks, I look at the chart and trust that the index managers make good picks. Same goes for a Dow Jones index, which is only 30 picks. What if you essentially created your own index? I used the following criteria: Preference for large and mega cap (all but 1 ended up in this bucket) Consistently growing earnings Charts that generally go up and to the right Quicker to recover from recessions than VTI Aim for somewhat reasonable diversification across industries I did not particularly care about *how* much the stock grew, only that it did so consistently I do NOT care about analysts opinions, leadership changes, news, lawsuits, or any other fundamentals. I only care about how the chart looks like and if earnings are on an up-trend. In other words, if something changes and the company starts underperforming compared to the rest of the list on a 2+ year time span, they're rotated out, regardless of why this happened. This means that you do NOT ""keep up with the news"". You do not read quarterly reports or listen to investor calls. Equal weights. I tried clustering companies via pairwise correlations and this actually ended up with worse results (though I'd love to learn more here!) The portfolio does significantly better than SPY if you start at the year 2000 (i.e. I wanted to include at least 2 recessions) Here are backtesting results (via portfoliovisualizer.com), I had to remove a handful of picks that didn't go all the way to before the 2000 recession: https://i.imgur.com/OzNZnVT.png Results: The portfolio did almost 10x better than SPY 1999 to today With a lower standard deviation, lower drawdowns, better 'best year' and 'worst year', and a higher sharpe ratio Discussion Points: ""Historical results don't predict future results"".

You mentioned in your other comment that that you would buy and sell based on it not fitting your criteria for example ge in 2002. Well stocks like appl in 2017 showed its first negative earning and declining iPhone sales for its first time since the iPhone was introduced( if I remember). Would you have sold then? Also you didn’t provide a reason why ge was excluded. Ge actually had increasing revenue at the time. If you were to exclude ge in 2002 you would also have to exclude Microsoft too.Basically your criteria is too simple it’s easy to say I will only pick stocks that have company earning growth and the stock only goes up and large caps. Well mentioned early it’s easy to look back and pick stocks that won.
