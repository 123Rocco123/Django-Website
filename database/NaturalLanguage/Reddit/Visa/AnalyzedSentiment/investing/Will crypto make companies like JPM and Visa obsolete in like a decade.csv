,I want to start a position in Visa and JPM but I believe crypto will make these companies obsolete in about a decade.

It's been a decade and there is basically no real world applications for them. No one wants to use a currency with values that fluctuate so much.,0,0.529,1.0,NEGATIVE

If you think they won't exist in 10 years I wouldn't buy the stocks. Everyone has a different view on the future that's what makes a market.,0,0.543,0.725,NEGATIVE

This may include traditional insurance which protects you against unauthorized use of your Visa card, or protections against someone stealing your checking account info, etc. .. In the case of crypto, people need guarantees that they can get their money back if it disappears.Stable coins that aren't backed against the USD. The only stability in the crypto space is currently like USDT, which is pegged against the US Dollar.Accepted everywhere. This requires #2 to be true in order for cryptocurrencies to be accepted. Transactions perform best when there is stability in a currency system.Mass adoption. The crypto space is incredibly small right now. Depending on which view you subscribe to, the space may be falsely represented (see ref-a) and may in fact be a lot smaller than it actually is. When Bitcoin was trading at $16, 17k+ everyone and their dog wanted to sign up for coinbase (it was the #1 app on the app store at the time). Then the masses lost a lot of money. And the masses lost interest. I've known plenty of crypto junkies who have placed their cryptocurrencies in the ""junk"" part of their portfolio, and they probably won't return.Benefit over traditional currency. This is a big one, especially in established countries. Outside of transactions that you ""dont want to be traced"", there's no benefit in using a BTC over using a USD. If your BTC wallet gets hacked (in the case of you using an online brokerage) or stolen (in the case of the physical), you can't do anything about it. With a Visa card, you can make a simple phone call and the issue gets resolved.Additionally, people have been calling for traditional banking systems to be dismantled for years. It still hasn't happened and most likely will not happen in our lifetimes (at least in the US). People still write checks. One decade from now, merchants are still going to be accepting your Visa or Mastercard.ref-a: https://www.technologyreview.com/f/613201/nearly-all-bitcoin-trades-are-fake-apparently/",0,0.514,0.856,NEGATIVE

I only care about dividend stocks that I can hold forever and if crypto makes these companies obsolete I'm worried about starting a position in them when I can be putting my funds in different long term holdings,For crypto to work it's way into the mainstream I think it'll take firms like JPM and Visa to offer short term credit because of the exceptionally slow transaction rate that crypto faces. So you buy and [bank] loans the money while you wait for your transaction to clear.,0,0.522,0.999,NEGATIVE

Bitcoin itself is still dreadfully slow with an average or median transaction size of between 3.3 and 7 transactions per second.The very notion that each transaction has to be ledgered along with every other transaction in the world means as these things scale up, they'll slow down.",2,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE
