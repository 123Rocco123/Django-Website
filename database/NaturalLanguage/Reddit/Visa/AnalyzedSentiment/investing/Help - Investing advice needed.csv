,"Hi, I am a 25 yr old, currently working in the US on F-1 visa (student visa). My plan is to work here for another 8 to 10 years (assuming I get an H1B visa in the next 2 years) and then move to my home country. With this in mind I haven't opened up a 401k (also my current employer does not match). I have been trying out my hand on stocks with Robinhood (I think I am not doing good, up only 8% over an 8 month period), but I don't want stocks to be my only investment strategy. I am feeling really lost right now. I don't know what to do with all this money sitting in my account. Honestly, I think my spending has gone up because of this. I am going to open a Savings account (probably Ally) and temporarily put it all there. But I'd really appreciate any and all suggestions about how/where should I invest. If you guys think I should get some professional help, please suggest some firm based in Bay area, California.","Put some into a good ETF, vanguard has some with a solid return and dividends. That being said 8% isn't bad if your just throwing money into stocks.",0,0.58,0.669,NEGATIVE
