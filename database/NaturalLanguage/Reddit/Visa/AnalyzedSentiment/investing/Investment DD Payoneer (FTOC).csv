,"Just to be upfront, I view Payoneer as a great long-term hold. I started acquiring PayPal shares in 2016 and haven't sold since. I see some parallels with Payoneer but patience is the key. This is not really a r/SPAC play as much as its a r/investing play. (No comment on r/WSB.) While getting added to ARKF would be nice for a near-term pop, sometimes lying low to get your act together is a good thing. PayPal benefitted from the same dynamic until investors realized the company's scale was enormous. (Obviously, the eBay relationship played a huge role but the stock traded in the $80-110 range for two years before Covid drove the stock up 3x.) There will come a point when investors realize Payoneer's opportunity, but right now the opportunity is buried under mediocre financials (see below) and a frothy SPAC market for which anything less than a 50% pop at DA is a dud. It's only when you dig deeper into the potential scale benefits and where the current investments are going that you realize this may be PayPal 2.0. Hence, thee current situation is actually a great opportunity for Payoneer investors. Obviously, I would encourage everyone to do their own DD starting with the investor presentation and webcast. I personally found the presentation short on key metrics and financial detail and long on buzz words. (I guess $95mn in bankers' fees only buys so much these days.) That said, the acquisition has yet to close and Payoneer needs to be prudent. I would also add that while I avoid stereotypes, Payoneer seems to be another addition to Israel's strong lineage and tradition of building great technology companies where the MO seems to be under-promise and over-deliver. ********* Payoneer (FTOC) Summary: Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at a reasonable entry point. What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team knows what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position. IMHO the key for the company (and the stock) is to better explain the customer ROI at the unit level and why investments now make sense from a CLTV sense. The company also needs to address flattish margins on 25% revenue growth and negative EBITDA after 15 years of operations. I think the company missed an excellent opportunity to frame the discussion out of the gate by highlighting the benefits of its scale with detailed customer metrics, e.g., subscriber acquisition costs (SAC), churn, and most importantly customer lifetime value (CLTV). These are really the metrics which matter to thoughtful investors as well as the usual financials. If this was an obvious play, it would be trading significantly higher. (Un)fortunately, most investors don't like complexity or have the patience to watch a good company become a great company. I think this may be a situation where really digging into the financials and business model could reward investors handsomely over time. That said, far more DD is needed as well as much more disclosure from the company before one can make a decision. I would encourage investors to take a modest position and then build on it as the DD validates. The acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021 at which point detailed financials should be available. Company: Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world). Customers: Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network. This blog post does a nice job of discussing Payoneer's entry into China, which looks promising. My concern with China is exactly what's happening, namely, the competition is driving down the price. PayPal entered with a 5% fee and the industry is now around 1%. The post quotes a VC who aptly sums up the situation: You don’t have to be the first, but you need to be better, cheaper and faster. This dynamic obviously has margin implications and also illustrates why higher-value services are important longer-term. Expect WorldFirst and AirWallex to continue to further drive this dynamic. I need to comment on Payoneer's customer service, which based on a perusal of r/Payoneer leaves something to be desired. First, the Wirecard scandal caused Payoneer to move to an Ireland-based bank, which has pretty onerous documentation requirements. Clearly this has upset a fair amount of vendors. I have no idea how many were impacted as a % of the total customer base but enough to warrant attention. I'm hoping this is a transitory issue but it obviously needs to be monitored. Second, the payments industry like the broadband industry is one in which if the service is not delivered seamlessly, customers will gripe to no end. (You hate your cable company but you NEED BB. You know it.) The only thing worse than BB latency is cash latency, i.e., a delay or freeze on your account. Clearly, the industry as a whole needs to do better. I can attest firsthand that vendor complaints about PayPal have reached a deafening level. However, as one disgruntled vendor notes, it's basically a two horse race. There is no third option. Assuming that's the case, I like Payoneer's position given its lower fees and better service on a relative basis than PayPal. Again, I want to see customer service scores moving in the right direction. No question. But the industry has come a long way from Western Union. Customer service. After spending some time on the r/Payoneer sub-reddit, I have two initial impressions. While the Wirecard scandal caused a headache for Payoneer’s customers, it seems to be a transitory issue. The Wirecard scandal aside, Payoneer’s customer service is less than perfect and needs to improve. (Note: few people go out of their way to praise a bank or their cable company for seamlessly delivering the services the customers pay for. Please keep that in mind when browsing r/Payoneer.) User feedback. I would very much like to thank u/-Jack-The-Lad, who provided some really great insights into his experience using Payoneer as a vendor based in Europe. Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape. A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to. Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days. Vendors can also pay suppliers directly through wire transfers and pay for services like hosting using the MasterCard. However, customers can't fund their Payoneer account. While Payoneer likes the reputation of being ""a U.S bank account"" they really are not. They are a service that allows you to receive payment from companies. While individuals can send money from and to other Payoneer accounts, wire transfers to the account can only be done by a business. As a result of the Wirecard scandal, Payoneer now gives customers the option to choose to hold their funds on their MasterCard or on Payoneer own accounts. From u/-Jack-The-Lad: “Overall I think Payoneer is a good company. They have a lot of room for expansion and their market is beyond huge. One thing I am concerned about is the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny. As Payoneer grows, it will likely get noticed by countries and may face stricter regulations both in the U.S and abroad.” Fellow customer u/tonysoleoptions notes that Payoneer offers a no frills currency exchange service while is reliable and dependable. In terms of areas for improvement he cites the slower transaction times relative to PayPal and less than optimal reporting. Industry and market opportunity: B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, “scale” and “network effects”. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they’re benefitting from these dynamics but the disclosure could have been better (more about that below). Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.) Management team and investor base: Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at MasterCard and First Data, which is exactly what you want to see. As this Barron's article notes (h/t whmcpanel), unlike with an IPO, the sponsor and institutional investors get to look at the financials before making an investment decision. This is a crucial distinction for two reasons. First, you need to choose your SPAC carefully because you're relying on the sponsor to do thorough due diligence (DD). Second, if quality institutional investors participate, it generally means they like what they saw in their DD. On both accounts, Payoneer looks promising. Betsy Cohen is an industry leader in FinTech and Payoneer's institutional investor (II) base is high quality with IIs such as Dragoneer, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Millennium, T. Rowe, and Winslow Capital Management. Wellington Management, an existing investor, also participated. These are IIs who understand FinTech and like what they saw in their DD, which is an encouraging sign.  Business model: Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years. I would say all else equal flat revenue growth vs. decelerating volume growth is a good thing but again a deeper dive into the product mix is necessary. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed. While the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn’t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I’m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins. I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition related. As for the all-important unit-economics, the customer payback period is less than 12 months, which is nice. Disclosing CLTV would have been better. The company also noted net volume retention (i.e., same store comparison of customer Y/Y volume) is over 100% but did not disclose exactly what the percentage is. This is somewhat irrelevant since anything less than 100% and the company wouldn't be getting acquired. I found the SMB cohort volume on slide 27 interesting. While it's lacking a Y-axis for volume (ugh!), it's clear each year's cohort of customers are roughly following a similar trajectory although 2015 seems to be a slight outlier. Now, if the company would just disclose the unit economics for these cohorts, you'd have your investment decision made. I think at this point, you have to trust the quality of FTOC and the II's DD. As I suggested above, my guess is that they drilled down pretty heavily and liked what they saw. Finally, many are looking at Payoneer’s transaction fees to get a sense for the potential revenue opportunity. While this is logical, it is somewhat misleading because these services are considered low quality revenue as I note above (cf. the race to sub-1% fees in China). Similar to the CDN business, where moving traffic is a commodity while providing web acceleration and cloud security offer higher margins, Payoneer needs to upsell higher value added services to its customer base, which was initially attracted by the low service fees. Once again, Payoneer highlighted these value added services in its presentation Note: the adjusted numbers were a turnoff. Covid happened. If you're benefitting from the acceleration in cross-border traffic due to the pandemic, don't exclude those sectors or markets negatively impacted by said pandemic. I believe the company was done a disservice by its bankers here in trying to manipulate the numbers. Investors aren't stupid and if they are, they're not the ones you want. This massaging of the numbers coupled with the lack of PF shares outstanding is a little concerning. It's early and the deal isn't completed yet so I'll give management the benefit of the doubt. For now. Valuation: FinTech companies such as PayPal, Square, and Payoneer are valued on subscriber growth. The key metric which the analysts will judge the company on is customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her/its lifetime. (Analysts apply a similar approach to wireless companies and data center REITs where each new subscriber or data center build is viewed on a payback and NPV basis. Technically, these companies are valued on earnings, EBITDA or AFFO but its CLTV or customer NPV which determines the valuation multiple.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter. Based on FTOC's current share price of ~$13.50, Payoneer's current market cap is roughly $6bn, which assumes ~430mn total shares outstanding.* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares.) The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels. The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's promote and the 30m shares in earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading +30% above NAV. Investment Thesis: Majority of traffic stays within the network. In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer. Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends. As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated. Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate. The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky. Playing the long game. The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for. I can tell you based on several years in the VC industry that this is their number one issue. You have the funds for payroll but they're tied up in A/R. This is where Payoneer is currently focused and I think it will represent a significant competitive advantage relative to its competition. I would love to see Payoneer partner with an institution like SVB which caters to small and emerging companies. Expect M&A to figure into the company’s strategic plans as well. Quality Sponsor and II's. As I noted above, Payoneer has a blue chip II base who performed DD not available with an IPO. These IIs clearly liked what they saw. Investors should certainly do their own DD but note that there is some impressive names in the II base, which is encouraging. Attractive valuation. Payoneer’s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and ""adjusted"" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or ""expand"" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more ""a when rather than if"" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors. Risks: Competition. PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don’t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here. Customer risk. Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo). Regulatory. Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V. Crypto currency. At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if it's just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer. FX exposure. I’m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure. TLDR: While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer’s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or “expanding” in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. I believe Payoneer will significantly reward LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their $6bn market cap vs. PayPal's +$300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business assuming the transaction past regulatory scrutiny. My advice is to spend more time digging and in the meantime acquire a small position upon which to build. ******************** Disclosure & Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor.

The key metric which the analysts will judge the company on is customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her/its lifetime. (Analysts apply a similar approach to wireless companies and data center REITs where each new subscriber or data center build is viewed on a payback and NPV basis. Technically, these companies are valued on earnings, EBITDA or AFFO but its CLTV or customer NPV which determines the valuation multiple.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter. Based on FTOC's current share price of ~$13.50, Payoneer's current market cap is roughly $6bn, which assumes ~430mn total shares outstanding.* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares.) The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels. The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's promote and the 30m shares in earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading +30% above NAV. Investment Thesis: Majority of traffic stays within the network. In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer. Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends. As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated. Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate. The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky. Playing the long game. The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for. I can tell you based on several years in the VC industry that this is their number one issue. You have the funds for payroll but they're tied up in A/R. This is where Payoneer is currently focused and I think it will represent a significant competitive advantage relative to its competition. I would love to see Payoneer partner with an institution like SVB which caters to small and emerging companies. Expect M&A to figure into the company’s strategic plans as well. Quality Sponsor and II's. As I noted above, Payoneer has a blue chip II base who performed DD not available with an IPO. These IIs clearly liked what they saw. Investors should certainly do their own DD but note that there is some impressive names in the II base, which is encouraging. Attractive valuation. Payoneer’s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and ""adjusted"" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or ""expand"" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more ""a when rather than if"" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors. Risks: Competition. PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don’t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here. Customer risk. Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo). Regulatory. Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V. Crypto currency. At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if it's just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer. FX exposure. I’m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure. TLDR: While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer’s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or “expanding” in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. I believe Payoneer will significantly reward LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their $6bn market cap vs. PayPal's +$300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business assuming the transaction past regulatory scrutiny. My advice is to spend more time digging and in the meantime acquire a small position upon which to build. ******************** Disclosure & Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor.

,"Just to be upfront, I view Payoneer as a great long-term hold. I started acquiring PayPal shares in 2016 and haven't sold since. I see some parallels with Payoneer but patience is the key. This is not really a r/SPAC play as much as its a r/investing play. (No comment on r/WSB.) While getting added to ARKF would be nice for a near-term pop, sometimes lying low to get your act together is a good thing. PayPal benefitted from the same dynamic until investors realized the company's scale was enormous. (Obviously, the eBay relationship played a huge role but the stock traded in the $80-110 range for two years before Covid drove the stock up 3x.) There will come a point when investors realize Payoneer's opportunity, but right now the opportunity is buried under mediocre financials (see below) and a frothy SPAC market for which anything less than a 50% pop at DA is a dud. It's only when you dig deeper into the potential scale benefits and where the current investments are going that you realize this may be PayPal 2.0. Hence, thee current situation is actually a great opportunity for Payoneer investors. Obviously, I would encourage everyone to do their own DD starting with the investor presentation and webcast. I personally found the presentation short on key metrics and financial detail and long on buzz words. (I guess $95mn in bankers' fees only buys so much these days.) That said, the acquisition has yet to close and Payoneer needs to be prudent. I would also add that while I avoid stereotypes, Payoneer seems to be another addition to Israel's strong lineage and tradition of building great technology companies where the MO seems to be under-promise and over-deliver. ********* Payoneer (FTOC) Summary: Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at a reasonable entry point. What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team knows what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position. IMHO the key for the company (and the stock) is to better explain the customer ROI at the unit level and why investments now make sense from a CLTV sense. The company also needs to address flattish margins on 25% revenue growth and negative EBITDA after 15 years of operations. I think the company missed an excellent opportunity to frame the discussion out of the gate by highlighting the benefits of its scale with detailed customer metrics, e.g., subscriber acquisition costs (SAC), churn, and most importantly customer lifetime value (CLTV). These are really the metrics which matter to thoughtful investors as well as the usual financials. If this was an obvious play, it would be trading significantly higher. (Un)fortunately, most investors don't like complexity or have the patience to watch a good company become a great company. I think this may be a situation where really digging into the financials and business model could reward investors handsomely over time. That said, far more DD is needed as well as much more disclosure from the company before one can make a decision. I would encourage investors to take a modest position and then build on it as the DD validates. The acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021 at which point detailed financials should be available. Company: Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world). Customers: Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network. This blog post does a nice job of discussing Payoneer's entry into China, which looks promising. My concern with China is exactly what's happening, namely, the competition is driving down the price. PayPal entered with a 5% fee and the industry is now around 1%. The post quotes a VC who aptly sums up the situation: You don’t have to be the first, but you need to be better, cheaper and faster. This dynamic obviously has margin implications and also illustrates why higher-value services are important longer-term. Expect WorldFirst and AirWallex to continue to further drive this dynamic. I need to comment on Payoneer's customer service, which based on a perusal of r/Payoneer leaves something to be desired. First, the Wirecard scandal caused Payoneer to move to an Ireland-based bank, which has pretty onerous documentation requirements. Clearly this has upset a fair amount of vendors. I have no idea how many were impacted as a % of the total customer base but enough to warrant attention. I'm hoping this is a transitory issue but it obviously needs to be monitored. Second, the payments industry like the broadband industry is one in which if the service is not delivered seamlessly, customers will gripe to no end. (You hate your cable company but you NEED BB. You know it.) The only thing worse than BB latency is cash latency, i.e., a delay or freeze on your account. Clearly, the industry as a whole needs to do better. I can attest firsthand that vendor complaints about PayPal have reached a deafening level. However, as one disgruntled vendor notes, it's basically a two horse race. There is no third option. Assuming that's the case, I like Payoneer's position given its lower fees and better service on a relative basis than PayPal. Again, I want to see customer service scores moving in the right direction. No question. But the industry has come a long way from Western Union. Customer service. After spending some time on the r/Payoneer sub-reddit, I have two initial impressions. While the Wirecard scandal caused a headache for Payoneer’s customers, it seems to be a transitory issue. The Wirecard scandal aside, Payoneer’s customer service is less than perfect and needs to improve. (Note: few people go out of their way to praise a bank or their cable company for seamlessly delivering the services the customers pay for. Please keep that in mind when browsing r/Payoneer.) User feedback. I would very much like to thank u/-Jack-The-Lad, who provided some really great insights into his experience using Payoneer as a vendor based in Europe. Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape. A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to. Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days. Vendors can also pay suppliers directly through wire transfers and pay for services like hosting using the MasterCard. However, customers can't fund their Payoneer account. While Payoneer likes the reputation of being ""a U.S bank account"" they really are not. They are a service that allows you to receive payment from companies. While individuals can send money from and to other Payoneer accounts, wire transfers to the account can only be done by a business. As a result of the Wirecard scandal, Payoneer now gives customers the option to choose to hold their funds on their MasterCard or on Payoneer own accounts. From u/-Jack-The-Lad: “Overall I think Payoneer is a good company. They have a lot of room for expansion and their market is beyond huge. One thing I am concerned about is the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny. As Payoneer grows, it will likely get noticed by countries and may face stricter regulations both in the U.S and abroad.” Fellow customer u/tonysoleoptions notes that Payoneer offers a no frills currency exchange service while is reliable and dependable. In terms of areas for improvement he cites the slower transaction times relative to PayPal and less than optimal reporting. Industry and market opportunity: B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, “scale” and “network effects”. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they’re benefitting from these dynamics but the disclosure could have been better (more about that below). Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.) Management team and investor base: Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at MasterCard and First Data, which is exactly what you want to see. As this Barron's article notes (h/t whmcpanel), unlike with an IPO, the sponsor and institutional investors get to look at the financials before making an investment decision. This is a crucial distinction for two reasons. First, you need to choose your SPAC carefully because you're relying on the sponsor to do thorough due diligence (DD). Second, if quality institutional investors participate, it generally means they like what they saw in their DD. On both accounts, Payoneer looks promising. Betsy Cohen is an industry leader in FinTech and Payoneer's institutional investor (II) base is high quality with IIs such as Dragoneer, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Millennium, T. Rowe, and Winslow Capital Management. Wellington Management, an existing investor, also participated. These are IIs who understand FinTech and like what they saw in their DD, which is an encouraging sign.  Business model: Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years. I would say all else equal flat revenue growth vs. decelerating volume growth is a good thing but again a deeper dive into the product mix is necessary. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed. While the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn’t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I’m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins. I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition related. As for the all-important unit-economics, the customer payback period is less than 12 months, which is nice. Disclosing CLTV would have been better. The company also noted net volume retention (i.e., same store comparison of customer Y/Y volume) is over 100% but did not disclose exactly what the percentage is. This is somewhat irrelevant since anything less than 100% and the company wouldn't be getting acquired. I found the SMB cohort volume on slide 27 interesting. While it's lacking a Y-axis for volume (ugh!), it's clear each year's cohort of customers are roughly following a similar trajectory although 2015 seems to be a slight outlier. Now, if the company would just disclose the unit economics for these cohorts, you'd have your investment decision made. I think at this point, you have to trust the quality of FTOC and the II's DD. As I suggested above, my guess is that they drilled down pretty heavily and liked what they saw. Finally, many are looking at Payoneer’s transaction fees to get a sense for the potential revenue opportunity. While this is logical, it is somewhat misleading because these services are considered low quality revenue as I note above (cf. the race to sub-1% fees in China). Similar to the CDN business, where moving traffic is a commodity while providing web acceleration and cloud security offer higher margins, Payoneer needs to upsell higher value added services to its customer base, which was initially attracted by the low service fees. Once again, Payoneer highlighted these value added services in its presentation Note: the adjusted numbers were a turnoff. Covid happened. If you're benefitting from the acceleration in cross-border traffic due to the pandemic, don't exclude those sectors or markets negatively impacted by said pandemic. I believe the company was done a disservice by its bankers here in trying to manipulate the numbers. Investors aren't stupid and if they are, they're not the ones you want. This massaging of the numbers coupled with the lack of PF shares outstanding is a little concerning. It's early and the deal isn't completed yet so I'll give management the benefit of the doubt. For now. Valuation: FinTech companies such as PayPal, Square, and Payoneer are valued on subscriber growth. The key metric which the analysts will judge the company on is customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her/its lifetime. (Analysts apply a similar approach to wireless companies and data center REITs where each new subscriber or data center build is viewed on a payback and NPV basis. Technically, these companies are valued on earnings, EBITDA or AFFO but its CLTV or customer NPV which determines the valuation multiple.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter. Based on FTOC's current share price of ~$13.50, Payoneer's current market cap is roughly $6bn, which assumes ~430mn total shares outstanding.* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares.) The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels. The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's promote and the 30m shares in earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading +30% above NAV. Investment Thesis: Majority of traffic stays within the network. In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer. Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends. As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated. Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate. The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky. Playing the long game. The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for. I can tell you based on several years in the VC industry that this is their number one issue. You have the funds for payroll but they're tied up in A/R. This is where Payoneer is currently focused and I think it will represent a significant competitive advantage relative to its competition. I would love to see Payoneer partner with an institution like SVB which caters to small and emerging companies. Expect M&A to figure into the company’s strategic plans as well. Quality Sponsor and II's. As I noted above, Payoneer has a blue chip II base who performed DD not available with an IPO. These IIs clearly liked what they saw. Investors should certainly do their own DD but note that there is some impressive names in the II base, which is encouraging. Attractive valuation. Payoneer’s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and ""adjusted"" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or ""expand"" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more ""a when rather than if"" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors. Risks: Competition. PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don’t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here. Customer risk. Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo). Regulatory. Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V. Crypto currency. At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if it's just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer. FX exposure. I’m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure. TLDR: While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer’s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or “expanding” in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. I believe Payoneer will significantly reward LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their $6bn market cap vs. PayPal's +$300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business assuming the transaction past regulatory scrutiny. My advice is to spend more time digging and in the meantime acquire a small position upon which to build. ******************** Disclosure & Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor.

First, the Wirecard scandal caused Payoneer to move to an Ireland-based bank, which has pretty onerous documentation requirements. Clearly this has upset a fair amount of vendors. I have no idea how many were impacted as a % of the total customer base but enough to warrant attention. I'm hoping this is a transitory issue but it obviously needs to be monitored. Second, the payments industry like the broadband industry is one in which if the service is not delivered seamlessly, customers will gripe to no end. (You hate your cable company but you NEED BB. You know it.) The only thing worse than BB latency is cash latency, i.e., a delay or freeze on your account. Clearly, the industry as a whole needs to do better. I can attest firsthand that vendor complaints about PayPal have reached a deafening level. However, as one disgruntled vendor notes, it's basically a two horse race. There is no third option. Assuming that's the case, I like Payoneer's position given its lower fees and better service on a relative basis than PayPal. Again, I want to see customer service scores moving in the right direction. No question. But the industry has come a long way from Western Union. Customer service. After spending some time on the r/Payoneer sub-reddit, I have two initial impressions. While the Wirecard scandal caused a headache for Payoneer’s customers, it seems to be a transitory issue. The Wirecard scandal aside, Payoneer’s customer service is less than perfect and needs to improve. (Note: few people go out of their way to praise a bank or their cable company for seamlessly delivering the services the customers pay for. Please keep that in mind when browsing r/Payoneer.) User feedback. I would very much like to thank u/-Jack-The-Lad, who provided some really great insights into his experience using Payoneer as a vendor based in Europe. Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape. A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to. Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days. Vendors can also pay suppliers directly through wire transfers and pay for services like hosting using the MasterCard. However, customers can't fund their Payoneer account. While Payoneer likes the reputation of being ""a U.S bank account"" they really are not. They are a service that allows you to receive payment from companies. While individuals can send money from and to other Payoneer accounts, wire transfers to the account can only be done by a business. As a result of the Wirecard scandal, Payoneer now gives customers the option to choose to hold their funds on their MasterCard or on Payoneer own accounts. From u/-Jack-The-Lad: “Overall I think Payoneer is a good company. They have a lot of room for expansion and their market is beyond huge. One thing I am concerned about is the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny. As Payoneer grows, it will likely get noticed by countries and may face stricter regulations both in the U.S and abroad.” Fellow customer u/tonysoleoptions notes that Payoneer offers a no frills currency exchange service while is reliable and dependable. In terms of areas for improvement he cites the slower transaction times relative to PayPal and less than optimal reporting. Industry and market opportunity: B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, “scale” and “network effects”. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they’re benefitting from these dynamics but the disclosure could have been better (more about that below). Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.) Management team and investor base: Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at MasterCard and First Data, which is exactly what you want to see. As this Barron's article notes (h/t whmcpanel), unlike with an IPO, the sponsor and institutional investors get to look at the financials before making an investment decision. This is a crucial distinction for two reasons. First, you need to choose your SPAC carefully because you're relying on the sponsor to do thorough due diligence (DD). Second, if quality institutional investors participate, it generally means they like what they saw in their DD. On both accounts, Payoneer looks promising. Betsy Cohen is an industry leader in FinTech and Payoneer's institutional investor (II) base is high quality with IIs such as Dragoneer, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Millennium, T. Rowe, and Winslow Capital Management. Wellington Management, an existing investor, also participated. These are IIs who understand FinTech and like what they saw in their DD, which is an encouraging sign.  Business model: Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years. I would say all else equal flat revenue growth vs. decelerating volume growth is a good thing but again a deeper dive into the product mix is necessary. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed. While the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn’t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I’m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins. I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition related. As for the all-important unit-economics, the customer payback period is less than 12 months, which is nice. Disclosing CLTV would have been better. The company also noted net volume retention (i.e., same store comparison of customer Y/Y volume) is over 100% but did not disclose exactly what the percentage is. This is somewhat irrelevant since anything less than 100% and the company wouldn't be getting acquired. I found the SMB cohort volume on slide 27 interesting. While it's lacking a Y-axis for volume (ugh!), it's clear each year's cohort of customers are roughly following a similar trajectory although 2015 seems to be a slight outlier. Now, if the company would just disclose the unit economics for these cohorts, you'd have your investment decision made. I think at this point, you have to trust the quality of FTOC and the II's DD. As I suggested above, my guess is that they drilled down pretty heavily and liked what they saw. Finally, many are looking at Payoneer’s transaction fees to get a sense for the potential revenue opportunity. While this is logical, it is somewhat misleading because these services are considered low quality revenue as I note above (cf. the race to sub-1% fees in China). Similar to the CDN business, where moving traffic is a commodity while providing web acceleration and cloud security offer higher margins, Payoneer needs to upsell higher value added services to its customer base, which was initially attracted by the low service fees. Once again, Payoneer highlighted these value added services in its presentation Note: the adjusted numbers were a turnoff. Covid happened. If you're benefitting from the acceleration in cross-border traffic due to the pandemic, don't exclude those sectors or markets negatively impacted by said pandemic. I believe the company was done a disservice by its bankers here in trying to manipulate the numbers. Investors aren't stupid and if they are, they're not the ones you want. This massaging of the numbers coupled with the lack of PF shares outstanding is a little concerning. It's early and the deal isn't completed yet so I'll give management the benefit of the doubt. For now. Valuation: FinTech companies such as PayPal, Square, and Payoneer are valued on subscriber growth. The key metric which the analysts will judge the company on is customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her/its lifetime. (Analysts apply a similar approach to wireless companies and data center REITs where each new subscriber or data center build is viewed on a payback and NPV basis. Technically, these companies are valued on earnings, EBITDA or AFFO but its CLTV or customer NPV which determines the valuation multiple.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter. Based on FTOC's current share price of ~$13.50, Payoneer's current market cap is roughly $6bn, which assumes ~430mn total shares outstanding.* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares.) The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels. The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's promote and the 30m shares in earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading +30% above NAV. Investment Thesis: Majority of traffic stays within the network. In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer. Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends. As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated. Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate. The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky. Playing the long game. The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for. I can tell you based on several years in the VC industry that this is their number one issue. You have the funds for payroll but they're tied up in A/R. This is where Payoneer is currently focused and I think it will represent a significant competitive advantage relative to its competition. I would love to see Payoneer partner with an institution like SVB which caters to small and emerging companies. Expect M&A to figure into the company’s strategic plans as well. Quality Sponsor and II's. As I noted above, Payoneer has a blue chip II base who performed DD not available with an IPO. These IIs clearly liked what they saw. Investors should certainly do their own DD but note that there is some impressive names in the II base, which is encouraging. Attractive valuation. Payoneer’s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and ""adjusted"" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or ""expand"" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more ""a when rather than if"" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors. Risks: Competition. PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don’t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here. Customer risk. Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo). Regulatory. Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V. Crypto currency. At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if it's just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer. FX exposure. I’m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure. TLDR: While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer’s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or “expanding” in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. I believe Payoneer will significantly reward LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their $6bn market cap vs. PayPal's +$300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business assuming the transaction past regulatory scrutiny. My advice is to spend more time digging and in the meantime acquire a small position upon which to build. ******************** Disclosure & Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor.

,"Just to be upfront, I view Payoneer as a great long-term hold. I started acquiring PayPal shares in 2016 and haven't sold since. I see some parallels with Payoneer but patience is the key. This is not really a r/SPAC play as much as its a r/investing play. (No comment on r/WSB.) While getting added to ARKF would be nice for a near-term pop, sometimes lying low to get your act together is a good thing. PayPal benefitted from the same dynamic until investors realized the company's scale was enormous. (Obviously, the eBay relationship played a huge role but the stock traded in the $80-110 range for two years before Covid drove the stock up 3x.) There will come a point when investors realize Payoneer's opportunity, but right now the opportunity is buried under mediocre financials (see below) and a frothy SPAC market for which anything less than a 50% pop at DA is a dud. It's only when you dig deeper into the potential scale benefits and where the current investments are going that you realize this may be PayPal 2.0. Hence, thee current situation is actually a great opportunity for Payoneer investors. Obviously, I would encourage everyone to do their own DD starting with the investor presentation and webcast. I personally found the presentation short on key metrics and financial detail and long on buzz words. (I guess $95mn in bankers' fees only buys so much these days.) That said, the acquisition has yet to close and Payoneer needs to be prudent. I would also add that while I avoid stereotypes, Payoneer seems to be another addition to Israel's strong lineage and tradition of building great technology companies where the MO seems to be under-promise and over-deliver. ********* Payoneer (FTOC) Summary: Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at a reasonable entry point. What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team knows what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position. IMHO the key for the company (and the stock) is to better explain the customer ROI at the unit level and why investments now make sense from a CLTV sense. The company also needs to address flattish margins on 25% revenue growth and negative EBITDA after 15 years of operations. I think the company missed an excellent opportunity to frame the discussion out of the gate by highlighting the benefits of its scale with detailed customer metrics, e.g., subscriber acquisition costs (SAC), churn, and most importantly customer lifetime value (CLTV). These are really the metrics which matter to thoughtful investors as well as the usual financials. If this was an obvious play, it would be trading significantly higher. (Un)fortunately, most investors don't like complexity or have the patience to watch a good company become a great company. I think this may be a situation where really digging into the financials and business model could reward investors handsomely over time. That said, far more DD is needed as well as much more disclosure from the company before one can make a decision. I would encourage investors to take a modest position and then build on it as the DD validates. The acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021 at which point detailed financials should be available. Company: Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world). Customers: Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network. This blog post does a nice job of discussing Payoneer's entry into China, which looks promising. My concern with China is exactly what's happening, namely, the competition is driving down the price. PayPal entered with a 5% fee and the industry is now around 1%. The post quotes a VC who aptly sums up the situation: You don’t have to be the first, but you need to be better, cheaper and faster. This dynamic obviously has margin implications and also illustrates why higher-value services are important longer-term. Expect WorldFirst and AirWallex to continue to further drive this dynamic. I need to comment on Payoneer's customer service, which based on a perusal of r/Payoneer leaves something to be desired. First, the Wirecard scandal caused Payoneer to move to an Ireland-based bank, which has pretty onerous documentation requirements. Clearly this has upset a fair amount of vendors.

Quality Sponsor and II's. As I noted above, Payoneer has a blue chip II base who performed DD not available with an IPO. These IIs clearly liked what they saw. Investors should certainly do their own DD but note that there is some impressive names in the II base, which is encouraging. Attractive valuation. Payoneer’s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and ""adjusted"" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or ""expand"" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more ""a when rather than if"" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors. Risks: Competition. PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don’t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here. Customer risk. Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo). Regulatory. Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V. Crypto currency. At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if it's just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer. FX exposure. I’m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure. TLDR: While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer’s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or “expanding” in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. I believe Payoneer will significantly reward LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their $6bn market cap vs. PayPal's +$300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business assuming the transaction past regulatory scrutiny. My advice is to spend more time digging and in the meantime acquire a small position upon which to build. ******************** Disclosure & Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor.

,"Just to be upfront, I view Payoneer as a great long-term hold. I started acquiring PayPal shares in 2016 and haven't sold since. I see some parallels with Payoneer but patience is the key. This is not really a r/SPAC play as much as its a r/investing play. (No comment on r/WSB.) While getting added to ARKF would be nice for a near-term pop, sometimes lying low to get your act together is a good thing. PayPal benefitted from the same dynamic until investors realized the company's scale was enormous. (Obviously, the eBay relationship played a huge role but the stock traded in the $80-110 range for two years before Covid drove the stock up 3x.) There will come a point when investors realize Payoneer's opportunity, but right now the opportunity is buried under mediocre financials (see below) and a frothy SPAC market for which anything less than a 50% pop at DA is a dud. It's only when you dig deeper into the potential scale benefits and where the current investments are going that you realize this may be PayPal 2.0. Hence, thee current situation is actually a great opportunity for Payoneer investors. Obviously, I would encourage everyone to do their own DD starting with the investor presentation and webcast. I personally found the presentation short on key metrics and financial detail and long on buzz words. (I guess $95mn in bankers' fees only buys so much these days.) That said, the acquisition has yet to close and Payoneer needs to be prudent. I would also add that while I avoid stereotypes, Payoneer seems to be another addition to Israel's strong lineage and tradition of building great technology companies where the MO seems to be under-promise and over-deliver. ********* Payoneer (FTOC) Summary: Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at a reasonable entry point. What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team knows what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position. IMHO the key for the company (and the stock) is to better explain the customer ROI at the unit level and why investments now make sense from a CLTV sense. The company also needs to address flattish margins on 25% revenue growth and negative EBITDA after 15 years of operations. I think the company missed an excellent opportunity to frame the discussion out of the gate by highlighting the benefits of its scale with detailed customer metrics, e.g., subscriber acquisition costs (SAC), churn, and most importantly customer lifetime value (CLTV). These are really the metrics which matter to thoughtful investors as well as the usual financials. If this was an obvious play, it would be trading significantly higher. (Un)fortunately, most investors don't like complexity or have the patience to watch a good company become a great company. I think this may be a situation where really digging into the financials and business model could reward investors handsomely over time. That said, far more DD is needed as well as much more disclosure from the company before one can make a decision. I would encourage investors to take a modest position and then build on it as the DD validates. The acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021 at which point detailed financials should be available. Company: Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world). Customers: Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network. This blog post does a nice job of discussing Payoneer's entry into China, which looks promising. My concern with China is exactly what's happening, namely, the competition is driving down the price. PayPal entered with a 5% fee and the industry is now around 1%. The post quotes a VC who aptly sums up the situation: You don’t have to be the first, but you need to be better, cheaper and faster. This dynamic obviously has margin implications and also illustrates why higher-value services are important longer-term. Expect WorldFirst and AirWallex to continue to further drive this dynamic. I need to comment on Payoneer's customer service, which based on a perusal of r/Payoneer leaves something to be desired. First, the Wirecard scandal caused Payoneer to move to an Ireland-based bank, which has pretty onerous documentation requirements. Clearly this has upset a fair amount of vendors. I have no idea how many were impacted as a % of the total customer base but enough to warrant attention. I'm hoping this is a transitory issue but it obviously needs to be monitored. Second, the payments industry like the broadband industry is one in which if the service is not delivered seamlessly, customers will gripe to no end. (You hate your cable company but you NEED BB. You know it.) The only thing worse than BB latency is cash latency, i.e., a delay or freeze on your account. Clearly, the industry as a whole needs to do better. I can attest firsthand that vendor complaints about PayPal have reached a deafening level. However, as one disgruntled vendor notes, it's basically a two horse race. There is no third option. Assuming that's the case, I like Payoneer's position given its lower fees and better service on a relative basis than PayPal. Again, I want to see customer service scores moving in the right direction. No question. But the industry has come a long way from Western Union. Customer service. After spending some time on the r/Payoneer sub-reddit, I have two initial impressions. While the Wirecard scandal caused a headache for Payoneer’s customers, it seems to be a transitory issue. The Wirecard scandal aside, Payoneer’s customer service is less than perfect and needs to improve. (Note: few people go out of their way to praise a bank or their cable company for seamlessly delivering the services the customers pay for. Please keep that in mind when browsing r/Payoneer.) User feedback. I would very much like to thank u/-Jack-The-Lad, who provided some really great insights into his experience using Payoneer as a vendor based in Europe. Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape. A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to. Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days. Vendors can also pay suppliers directly through wire transfers and pay for services like hosting using the MasterCard. However, customers can't fund their Payoneer account. While Payoneer likes the reputation of being ""a U.S bank account"" they really are not. They are a service that allows you to receive payment from companies. While individuals can send money from and to other Payoneer accounts, wire transfers to the account can only be done by a business. As a result of the Wirecard scandal, Payoneer now gives customers the option to choose to hold their funds on their MasterCard or on Payoneer own accounts. From u/-Jack-The-Lad: “Overall I think Payoneer is a good company. They have a lot of room for expansion and their market is beyond huge. One thing I am concerned about is the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny. As Payoneer grows, it will likely get noticed by countries and may face stricter regulations both in the U.S and abroad.” Fellow customer u/tonysoleoptions notes that Payoneer offers a no frills currency exchange service while is reliable and dependable. In terms of areas for improvement he cites the slower transaction times relative to PayPal and less than optimal reporting. Industry and market opportunity: B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, “scale” and “network effects”. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they’re benefitting from these dynamics but the disclosure could have been better (more about that below). Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.) Management team and investor base: Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at MasterCard and First Data, which is exactly what you want to see. As this Barron's article notes (h/t whmcpanel), unlike with an IPO, the sponsor and institutional investors get to look at the financials before making an investment decision. This is a crucial distinction for two reasons. First, you need to choose your SPAC carefully because you're relying on the sponsor to do thorough due diligence (DD). Second, if quality institutional investors participate, it generally means they like what they saw in their DD. On both accounts, Payoneer looks promising. Betsy Cohen is an industry leader in FinTech and Payoneer's institutional investor (II) base is high quality with IIs such as Dragoneer, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Millennium, T. Rowe, and Winslow Capital Management. Wellington Management, an existing investor, also participated. These are IIs who understand FinTech and like what they saw in their DD, which is an encouraging sign.  Business model: Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years. I would say all else equal flat revenue growth vs. decelerating volume growth is a good thing but again a deeper dive into the product mix is necessary. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed. While the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn’t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I’m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins. I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition related. As for the all-important unit-economics, the customer payback period is less than 12 months, which is nice. Disclosing CLTV would have been better. The company also noted net volume retention (i.e., same store comparison of customer Y/Y volume) is over 100% but did not disclose exactly what the percentage is. This is somewhat irrelevant since anything less than 100% and the company wouldn't be getting acquired. I found the SMB cohort volume on slide 27 interesting. While it's lacking a Y-axis for volume (ugh!), it's clear each year's cohort of customers are roughly following a similar trajectory although 2015 seems to be a slight outlier. Now, if the company would just disclose the unit economics for these cohorts, you'd have your investment decision made. I think at this point, you have to trust the quality of FTOC and the II's DD. As I suggested above, my guess is that they drilled down pretty heavily and liked what they saw. Finally, many are looking at Payoneer’s transaction fees to get a sense for the potential revenue opportunity. While this is logical, it is somewhat misleading because these services are considered low quality revenue as I note above (cf. the race to sub-1% fees in China). Similar to the CDN business, where moving traffic is a commodity while providing web acceleration and cloud security offer higher margins, Payoneer needs to upsell higher value added services to its customer base, which was initially attracted by the low service fees. Once again, Payoneer highlighted these value added services in its presentation Note: the adjusted numbers were a turnoff. Covid happened. If you're benefitting from the acceleration in cross-border traffic due to the pandemic, don't exclude those sectors or markets negatively impacted by said pandemic. I believe the company was done a disservice by its bankers here in trying to manipulate the numbers. Investors aren't stupid and if they are, they're not the ones you want. This massaging of the numbers coupled with the lack of PF shares outstanding is a little concerning. It's early and the deal isn't completed yet so I'll give management the benefit of the doubt. For now. Valuation: FinTech companies such as PayPal, Square, and Payoneer are valued on subscriber growth. The key metric which the analysts will judge the company on is customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her/its lifetime. (Analysts apply a similar approach to wireless companies and data center REITs where each new subscriber or data center build is viewed on a payback and NPV basis. Technically, these companies are valued on earnings, EBITDA or AFFO but its CLTV or customer NPV which determines the valuation multiple.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter. Based on FTOC's current share price of ~$13.50, Payoneer's current market cap is roughly $6bn, which assumes ~430mn total shares outstanding.* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares.) The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels. The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's promote and the 30m shares in earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading +30% above NAV. Investment Thesis: Majority of traffic stays within the network. In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer. Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends. As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated. Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate. The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky. Playing the long game. The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for. I can tell you based on several years in the VC industry that this is their number one issue. You have the funds for payroll but they're tied up in A/R. This is where Payoneer is currently focused and I think it will represent a significant competitive advantage relative to its competition. I would love to see Payoneer partner with an institution like SVB which caters to small and emerging companies. Expect M&A to figure into the company’s strategic plans as well. Quality Sponsor and II's. As I noted above, Payoneer has a blue chip II base who performed DD not available with an IPO. These IIs clearly liked what they saw. Investors should certainly do their own DD but note that there is some impressive names in the II base, which is encouraging. Attractive valuation. Payoneer’s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and ""adjusted"" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or ""expand"" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more ""a when rather than if"" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors. Risks: Competition. PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don’t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here. Customer risk. Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo). Regulatory. Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V. Crypto currency. At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if it's just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer. FX exposure. I’m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure. TLDR: While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer’s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or “expanding” in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. I believe Payoneer will significantly reward LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model.

,"Just to be upfront, I view Payoneer as a great long-term hold. I started acquiring PayPal shares in 2016 and haven't sold since. I see some parallels with Payoneer but patience is the key. This is not really a r/SPAC play as much as its a r/investing play. (No comment on r/WSB.) While getting added to ARKF would be nice for a near-term pop, sometimes lying low to get your act together is a good thing. PayPal benefitted from the same dynamic until investors realized the company's scale was enormous. (Obviously, the eBay relationship played a huge role but the stock traded in the $80-110 range for two years before Covid drove the stock up 3x.) There will come a point when investors realize Payoneer's opportunity, but right now the opportunity is buried under mediocre financials (see below) and a frothy SPAC market for which anything less than a 50% pop at DA is a dud. It's only when you dig deeper into the potential scale benefits and where the current investments are going that you realize this may be PayPal 2.0. Hence, thee current situation is actually a great opportunity for Payoneer investors. Obviously, I would encourage everyone to do their own DD starting with the investor presentation and webcast. I personally found the presentation short on key metrics and financial detail and long on buzz words. (I guess $95mn in bankers' fees only buys so much these days.) That said, the acquisition has yet to close and Payoneer needs to be prudent. I would also add that while I avoid stereotypes, Payoneer seems to be another addition to Israel's strong lineage and tradition of building great technology companies where the MO seems to be under-promise and over-deliver. ********* Payoneer (FTOC) Summary: Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at a reasonable entry point. What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team knows what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position. IMHO the key for the company (and the stock) is to better explain the customer ROI at the unit level and why investments now make sense from a CLTV sense. The company also needs to address flattish margins on 25% revenue growth and negative EBITDA after 15 years of operations. I think the company missed an excellent opportunity to frame the discussion out of the gate by highlighting the benefits of its scale with detailed customer metrics, e.g., subscriber acquisition costs (SAC), churn, and most importantly customer lifetime value (CLTV). These are really the metrics which matter to thoughtful investors as well as the usual financials. If this was an obvious play, it would be trading significantly higher. (Un)fortunately, most investors don't like complexity or have the patience to watch a good company become a great company. I think this may be a situation where really digging into the financials and business model could reward investors handsomely over time. That said, far more DD is needed as well as much more disclosure from the company before one can make a decision. I would encourage investors to take a modest position and then build on it as the DD validates. The acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021 at which point detailed financials should be available. Company: Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world). Customers: Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network. This blog post does a nice job of discussing Payoneer's entry into China, which looks promising. My concern with China is exactly what's happening, namely, the competition is driving down the price. PayPal entered with a 5% fee and the industry is now around 1%. The post quotes a VC who aptly sums up the situation: You don’t have to be the first, but you need to be better, cheaper and faster. This dynamic obviously has margin implications and also illustrates why higher-value services are important longer-term. Expect WorldFirst and AirWallex to continue to further drive this dynamic. I need to comment on Payoneer's customer service, which based on a perusal of r/Payoneer leaves something to be desired. First, the Wirecard scandal caused Payoneer to move to an Ireland-based bank, which has pretty onerous documentation requirements. Clearly this has upset a fair amount of vendors. I have no idea how many were impacted as a % of the total customer base but enough to warrant attention. I'm hoping this is a transitory issue but it obviously needs to be monitored.

I can attest firsthand that vendor complaints about PayPal have reached a deafening level. However, as one disgruntled vendor notes, it's basically a two horse race. There is no third option.

The Wirecard scandal aside, Payoneer’s customer service is less than perfect and needs to improve. (Note: few people go out of their way to praise a bank or their cable company for seamlessly delivering the services the customers pay for. Please keep that in mind when browsing r/Payoneer.) User feedback. I would very much like to thank u/-Jack-The-Lad, who provided some really great insights into his experience using Payoneer as a vendor based in Europe. Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape. A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to. Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days. Vendors can also pay suppliers directly through wire transfers and pay for services like hosting using the MasterCard. However, customers can't fund their Payoneer account. While Payoneer likes the reputation of being ""a U.S bank account"" they really are not. They are a service that allows you to receive payment from companies. While individuals can send money from and to other Payoneer accounts, wire transfers to the account can only be done by a business. As a result of the Wirecard scandal, Payoneer now gives customers the option to choose to hold their funds on their MasterCard or on Payoneer own accounts. From u/-Jack-The-Lad: “Overall I think Payoneer is a good company. They have a lot of room for expansion and their market is beyond huge. One thing I am concerned about is the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny. As Payoneer grows, it will likely get noticed by countries and may face stricter regulations both in the U.S and abroad.” Fellow customer u/tonysoleoptions notes that Payoneer offers a no frills currency exchange service while is reliable and dependable. In terms of areas for improvement he cites the slower transaction times relative to PayPal and less than optimal reporting. Industry and market opportunity: B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, “scale” and “network effects”. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they’re benefitting from these dynamics but the disclosure could have been better (more about that below). Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.) Management team and investor base: Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at MasterCard and First Data, which is exactly what you want to see. As this Barron's article notes (h/t whmcpanel), unlike with an IPO, the sponsor and institutional investors get to look at the financials before making an investment decision. This is a crucial distinction for two reasons. First, you need to choose your SPAC carefully because you're relying on the sponsor to do thorough due diligence (DD). Second, if quality institutional investors participate, it generally means they like what they saw in their DD. On both accounts, Payoneer looks promising. Betsy Cohen is an industry leader in FinTech and Payoneer's institutional investor (II) base is high quality with IIs such as Dragoneer, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Millennium, T. Rowe, and Winslow Capital Management. Wellington Management, an existing investor, also participated. These are IIs who understand FinTech and like what they saw in their DD, which is an encouraging sign.  Business model: Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years. I would say all else equal flat revenue growth vs. decelerating volume growth is a good thing but again a deeper dive into the product mix is necessary. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed. While the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn’t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I’m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins. I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition related. As for the all-important unit-economics, the customer payback period is less than 12 months, which is nice. Disclosing CLTV would have been better. The company also noted net volume retention (i.e., same store comparison of customer Y/Y volume) is over 100% but did not disclose exactly what the percentage is. This is somewhat irrelevant since anything less than 100% and the company wouldn't be getting acquired. I found the SMB cohort volume on slide 27 interesting. While it's lacking a Y-axis for volume (ugh!), it's clear each year's cohort of customers are roughly following a similar trajectory although 2015 seems to be a slight outlier. Now, if the company would just disclose the unit economics for these cohorts, you'd have your investment decision made. I think at this point, you have to trust the quality of FTOC and the II's DD. As I suggested above, my guess is that they drilled down pretty heavily and liked what they saw. Finally, many are looking at Payoneer’s transaction fees to get a sense for the potential revenue opportunity. While this is logical, it is somewhat misleading because these services are considered low quality revenue as I note above (cf. the race to sub-1% fees in China). Similar to the CDN business, where moving traffic is a commodity while providing web acceleration and cloud security offer higher margins, Payoneer needs to upsell higher value added services to its customer base, which was initially attracted by the low service fees. Once again, Payoneer highlighted these value added services in its presentation Note: the adjusted numbers were a turnoff. Covid happened. If you're benefitting from the acceleration in cross-border traffic due to the pandemic, don't exclude those sectors or markets negatively impacted by said pandemic. I believe the company was done a disservice by its bankers here in trying to manipulate the numbers. Investors aren't stupid and if they are, they're not the ones you want. This massaging of the numbers coupled with the lack of PF shares outstanding is a little concerning. It's early and the deal isn't completed yet so I'll give management the benefit of the doubt. For now. Valuation: FinTech companies such as PayPal, Square, and Payoneer are valued on subscriber growth. The key metric which the analysts will judge the company on is customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her/its lifetime. (Analysts apply a similar approach to wireless companies and data center REITs where each new subscriber or data center build is viewed on a payback and NPV basis. Technically, these companies are valued on earnings, EBITDA or AFFO but its CLTV or customer NPV which determines the valuation multiple.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter. Based on FTOC's current share price of ~$13.50, Payoneer's current market cap is roughly $6bn, which assumes ~430mn total shares outstanding.* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares.) The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels. The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's promote and the 30m shares in earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading +30% above NAV. Investment Thesis: Majority of traffic stays within the network. In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer. Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends. As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated. Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate. The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky. Playing the long game. The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for. I can tell you based on several years in the VC industry that this is their number one issue. You have the funds for payroll but they're tied up in A/R. This is where Payoneer is currently focused and I think it will represent a significant competitive advantage relative to its competition. I would love to see Payoneer partner with an institution like SVB which caters to small and emerging companies. Expect M&A to figure into the company’s strategic plans as well. Quality Sponsor and II's. As I noted above, Payoneer has a blue chip II base who performed DD not available with an IPO. These IIs clearly liked what they saw. Investors should certainly do their own DD but note that there is some impressive names in the II base, which is encouraging. Attractive valuation. Payoneer’s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and ""adjusted"" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or ""expand"" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more ""a when rather than if"" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors. Risks: Competition. PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don’t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here. Customer risk. Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo). Regulatory. Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V. Crypto currency. At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if it's just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer. FX exposure. I’m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure. TLDR: While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer’s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or “expanding” in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. I believe Payoneer will significantly reward LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their $6bn market cap vs. PayPal's +$300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business assuming the transaction past regulatory scrutiny. My advice is to spend more time digging and in the meantime acquire a small position upon which to build. ******************** Disclosure & Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor. Please do your own due diligence. I have the following positions: 1,000 FTOC common shares 10 February/August Covered Calls @ $17.50 (short)/$12.50 (long). I intend to write monthly OTM calls against the long options (i.e., August options), which is known as a diagonal spread or poor man's covered call (PMCC). If anyone has insight into the attractiveness of the warrants, I would appreciate his/her perspective.",Fully onboard sounds like a great prospect for the future. With FTOC though looks like that ticker will only be worth 18.3% of the new company post-SPAC? So that makes the valuation closer to 8bil for payoneer if I’m doing that math right. I do understand they are saying the value is only 3.3bil on spac but the shares of FTOC are getting heavily diluted,0,0.542,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Just to be upfront, I view Payoneer as a great long-term hold. I started acquiring PayPal shares in 2016 and haven't sold since. I see some parallels with Payoneer but patience is the key. This is not really a r/SPAC play as much as its a r/investing play. (No comment on r/WSB.) While getting added to ARKF would be nice for a near-term pop, sometimes lying low to get your act together is a good thing. PayPal benefitted from the same dynamic until investors realized the company's scale was enormous. (Obviously, the eBay relationship played a huge role but the stock traded in the $80-110 range for two years before Covid drove the stock up 3x.) There will come a point when investors realize Payoneer's opportunity, but right now the opportunity is buried under mediocre financials (see below) and a frothy SPAC market for which anything less than a 50% pop at DA is a dud. It's only when you dig deeper into the potential scale benefits and where the current investments are going that you realize this may be PayPal 2.0. Hence, thee current situation is actually a great opportunity for Payoneer investors. Obviously, I would encourage everyone to do their own DD starting with the investor presentation and webcast. I personally found the presentation short on key metrics and financial detail and long on buzz words. (I guess $95mn in bankers' fees only buys so much these days.) That said, the acquisition has yet to close and Payoneer needs to be prudent. I would also add that while I avoid stereotypes, Payoneer seems to be another addition to Israel's strong lineage and tradition of building great technology companies where the MO seems to be under-promise and over-deliver. ********* Payoneer (FTOC) Summary: Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at a reasonable entry point. What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team knows what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position. IMHO the key for the company (and the stock) is to better explain the customer ROI at the unit level and why investments now make sense from a CLTV sense. The company also needs to address flattish margins on 25% revenue growth and negative EBITDA after 15 years of operations. I think the company missed an excellent opportunity to frame the discussion out of the gate by highlighting the benefits of its scale with detailed customer metrics, e.g., subscriber acquisition costs (SAC), churn, and most importantly customer lifetime value (CLTV). These are really the metrics which matter to thoughtful investors as well as the usual financials. If this was an obvious play, it would be trading significantly higher. (Un)fortunately, most investors don't like complexity or have the patience to watch a good company become a great company. I think this may be a situation where really digging into the financials and business model could reward investors handsomely over time. That said, far more DD is needed as well as much more disclosure from the company before one can make a decision. I would encourage investors to take a modest position and then build on it as the DD validates. The acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021 at which point detailed financials should be available. Company: Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world). Customers: Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network. This blog post does a nice job of discussing Payoneer's entry into China, which looks promising. My concern with China is exactly what's happening, namely, the competition is driving down the price. PayPal entered with a 5% fee and the industry is now around 1%. The post quotes a VC who aptly sums up the situation: You don’t have to be the first, but you need to be better, cheaper and faster. This dynamic obviously has margin implications and also illustrates why higher-value services are important longer-term. Expect WorldFirst and AirWallex to continue to further drive this dynamic. I need to comment on Payoneer's customer service, which based on a perusal of r/Payoneer leaves something to be desired. First, the Wirecard scandal caused Payoneer to move to an Ireland-based bank, which has pretty onerous documentation requirements. Clearly this has upset a fair amount of vendors. I have no idea how many were impacted as a % of the total customer base but enough to warrant attention. I'm hoping this is a transitory issue but it obviously needs to be monitored. Second, the payments industry like the broadband industry is one in which if the service is not delivered seamlessly, customers will gripe to no end. (You hate your cable company but you NEED BB. You know it.) The only thing worse than BB latency is cash latency, i.e., a delay or freeze on your account. Clearly, the industry as a whole needs to do better. I can attest firsthand that vendor complaints about PayPal have reached a deafening level. However, as one disgruntled vendor notes, it's basically a two horse race. There is no third option. Assuming that's the case, I like Payoneer's position given its lower fees and better service on a relative basis than PayPal. Again, I want to see customer service scores moving in the right direction. No question. But the industry has come a long way from Western Union. Customer service. After spending some time on the r/Payoneer sub-reddit, I have two initial impressions. While the Wirecard scandal caused a headache for Payoneer’s customers, it seems to be a transitory issue. The Wirecard scandal aside, Payoneer’s customer service is less than perfect and needs to improve. (Note: few people go out of their way to praise a bank or their cable company for seamlessly delivering the services the customers pay for. Please keep that in mind when browsing r/Payoneer.) User feedback. I would very much like to thank u/-Jack-The-Lad, who provided some really great insights into his experience using Payoneer as a vendor based in Europe. Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape. A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to. Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days. Vendors can also pay suppliers directly through wire transfers and pay for services like hosting using the MasterCard. However, customers can't fund their Payoneer account. While Payoneer likes the reputation of being ""a U.S bank account"" they really are not. They are a service that allows you to receive payment from companies. While individuals can send money from and to other Payoneer accounts, wire transfers to the account can only be done by a business. As a result of the Wirecard scandal, Payoneer now gives customers the option to choose to hold their funds on their MasterCard or on Payoneer own accounts. From u/-Jack-The-Lad: “Overall I think Payoneer is a good company. They have a lot of room for expansion and their market is beyond huge. One thing I am concerned about is the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny. As Payoneer grows, it will likely get noticed by countries and may face stricter regulations both in the U.S and abroad.” Fellow customer u/tonysoleoptions notes that Payoneer offers a no frills currency exchange service while is reliable and dependable. In terms of areas for improvement he cites the slower transaction times relative to PayPal and less than optimal reporting. Industry and market opportunity: B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, “scale” and “network effects”. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they’re benefitting from these dynamics but the disclosure could have been better (more about that below). Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.) Management team and investor base: Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at MasterCard and First Data, which is exactly what you want to see. As this Barron's article notes (h/t whmcpanel), unlike with an IPO, the sponsor and institutional investors get to look at the financials before making an investment decision. This is a crucial distinction for two reasons. First, you need to choose your SPAC carefully because you're relying on the sponsor to do thorough due diligence (DD). Second, if quality institutional investors participate, it generally means they like what they saw in their DD. On both accounts, Payoneer looks promising. Betsy Cohen is an industry leader in FinTech and Payoneer's institutional investor (II) base is high quality with IIs such as Dragoneer, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Millennium, T. Rowe, and Winslow Capital Management. Wellington Management, an existing investor, also participated. These are IIs who understand FinTech and like what they saw in their DD, which is an encouraging sign.  Business model: Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years. I would say all else equal flat revenue growth vs. decelerating volume growth is a good thing but again a deeper dive into the product mix is necessary. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed. While the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn’t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I’m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins. I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition related. As for the all-important unit-economics, the customer payback period is less than 12 months, which is nice. Disclosing CLTV would have been better. The company also noted net volume retention (i.e., same store comparison of customer Y/Y volume) is over 100% but did not disclose exactly what the percentage is. This is somewhat irrelevant since anything less than 100% and the company wouldn't be getting acquired. I found the SMB cohort volume on slide 27 interesting. While it's lacking a Y-axis for volume (ugh!), it's clear each year's cohort of customers are roughly following a similar trajectory although 2015 seems to be a slight outlier. Now, if the company would just disclose the unit economics for these cohorts, you'd have your investment decision made. I think at this point, you have to trust the quality of FTOC and the II's DD. As I suggested above, my guess is that they drilled down pretty heavily and liked what they saw. Finally, many are looking at Payoneer’s transaction fees to get a sense for the potential revenue opportunity. While this is logical, it is somewhat misleading because these services are considered low quality revenue as I note above (cf. the race to sub-1% fees in China). Similar to the CDN business, where moving traffic is a commodity while providing web acceleration and cloud security offer higher margins, Payoneer needs to upsell higher value added services to its customer base, which was initially attracted by the low service fees. Once again, Payoneer highlighted these value added services in its presentation Note: the adjusted numbers were a turnoff. Covid happened. If you're benefitting from the acceleration in cross-border traffic due to the pandemic, don't exclude those sectors or markets negatively impacted by said pandemic. I believe the company was done a disservice by its bankers here in trying to manipulate the numbers. Investors aren't stupid and if they are, they're not the ones you want. This massaging of the numbers coupled with the lack of PF shares outstanding is a little concerning. It's early and the deal isn't completed yet so I'll give management the benefit of the doubt. For now. Valuation: FinTech companies such as PayPal, Square, and Payoneer are valued on subscriber growth. The key metric which the analysts will judge the company on is customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her/its lifetime. (Analysts apply a similar approach to wireless companies and data center REITs where each new subscriber or data center build is viewed on a payback and NPV basis. Technically, these companies are valued on earnings, EBITDA or AFFO but its CLTV or customer NPV which determines the valuation multiple.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter. Based on FTOC's current share price of ~$13.50, Payoneer's current market cap is roughly $6bn, which assumes ~430mn total shares outstanding.* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares.) The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels. The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's promote and the 30m shares in earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading +30% above NAV. Investment Thesis: Majority of traffic stays within the network. In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer. Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends. As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated. Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate. The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky. Playing the long game. The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for. I can tell you based on several years in the VC industry that this is their number one issue. You have the funds for payroll but they're tied up in A/R. This is where Payoneer is currently focused and I think it will represent a significant competitive advantage relative to its competition. I would love to see Payoneer partner with an institution like SVB which caters to small and emerging companies. Expect M&A to figure into the company’s strategic plans as well. Quality Sponsor and II's. As I noted above, Payoneer has a blue chip II base who performed DD not available with an IPO. These IIs clearly liked what they saw. Investors should certainly do their own DD but note that there is some impressive names in the II base, which is encouraging. Attractive valuation. Payoneer’s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and ""adjusted"" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or ""expand"" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more ""a when rather than if"" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors. Risks: Competition. PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don’t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here. Customer risk. Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo). Regulatory. Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V. Crypto currency. At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if it's just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer. FX exposure. I’m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure. TLDR: While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer’s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or “expanding” in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. I believe Payoneer will significantly reward LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their $6bn market cap vs. PayPal's +$300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business assuming the transaction past regulatory scrutiny. My advice is to spend more time digging and in the meantime acquire a small position upon which to build. ******************** Disclosure & Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor.

While getting added to ARKF would be nice for a near-term pop, sometimes lying low to get your act together is a good thing. PayPal benefitted from the same dynamic until investors realized the company's scale was enormous. (Obviously, the eBay relationship played a huge role but the stock traded in the $80-110 range for two years before Covid drove the stock up 3x.) There will come a point when investors realize Payoneer's opportunity, but right now the opportunity is buried under mediocre financials (see below) and a frothy SPAC market for which anything less than a 50% pop at DA is a dud. It's only when you dig deeper into the potential scale benefits and where the current investments are going that you realize this may be PayPal 2.0. Hence, thee current situation is actually a great opportunity for Payoneer investors. Obviously, I would encourage everyone to do their own DD starting with the investor presentation and webcast. I personally found the presentation short on key metrics and financial detail and long on buzz words. (I guess $95mn in bankers' fees only buys so much these days.) That said, the acquisition has yet to close and Payoneer needs to be prudent. I would also add that while I avoid stereotypes, Payoneer seems to be another addition to Israel's strong lineage and tradition of building great technology companies where the MO seems to be under-promise and over-deliver. ********* Payoneer (FTOC) Summary: Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at a reasonable entry point. What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team knows what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position. IMHO the key for the company (and the stock) is to better explain the customer ROI at the unit level and why investments now make sense from a CLTV sense. The company also needs to address flattish margins on 25% revenue growth and negative EBITDA after 15 years of operations. I think the company missed an excellent opportunity to frame the discussion out of the gate by highlighting the benefits of its scale with detailed customer metrics, e.g., subscriber acquisition costs (SAC), churn, and most importantly customer lifetime value (CLTV). These are really the metrics which matter to thoughtful investors as well as the usual financials. If this was an obvious play, it would be trading significantly higher. (Un)fortunately, most investors don't like complexity or have the patience to watch a good company become a great company. I think this may be a situation where really digging into the financials and business model could reward investors handsomely over time. That said, far more DD is needed as well as much more disclosure from the company before one can make a decision. I would encourage investors to take a modest position and then build on it as the DD validates. The acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021 at which point detailed financials should be available. Company: Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world). Customers: Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network. This blog post does a nice job of discussing Payoneer's entry into China, which looks promising. My concern with China is exactly what's happening, namely, the competition is driving down the price. PayPal entered with a 5% fee and the industry is now around 1%. The post quotes a VC who aptly sums up the situation: You don’t have to be the first, but you need to be better, cheaper and faster. This dynamic obviously has margin implications and also illustrates why higher-value services are important longer-term. Expect WorldFirst and AirWallex to continue to further drive this dynamic. I need to comment on Payoneer's customer service, which based on a perusal of r/Payoneer leaves something to be desired. First, the Wirecard scandal caused Payoneer to move to an Ireland-based bank, which has pretty onerous documentation requirements. Clearly this has upset a fair amount of vendors. I have no idea how many were impacted as a % of the total customer base but enough to warrant attention. I'm hoping this is a transitory issue but it obviously needs to be monitored. Second, the payments industry like the broadband industry is one in which if the service is not delivered seamlessly, customers will gripe to no end. (You hate your cable company but you NEED BB. You know it.) The only thing worse than BB latency is cash latency, i.e., a delay or freeze on your account. Clearly, the industry as a whole needs to do better. I can attest firsthand that vendor complaints about PayPal have reached a deafening level. However, as one disgruntled vendor notes, it's basically a two horse race. There is no third option. Assuming that's the case, I like Payoneer's position given its lower fees and better service on a relative basis than PayPal. Again, I want to see customer service scores moving in the right direction. No question. But the industry has come a long way from Western Union. Customer service. After spending some time on the r/Payoneer sub-reddit, I have two initial impressions. While the Wirecard scandal caused a headache for Payoneer’s customers, it seems to be a transitory issue. The Wirecard scandal aside, Payoneer’s customer service is less than perfect and needs to improve. (Note: few people go out of their way to praise a bank or their cable company for seamlessly delivering the services the customers pay for. Please keep that in mind when browsing r/Payoneer.) User feedback. I would very much like to thank u/-Jack-The-Lad, who provided some really great insights into his experience using Payoneer as a vendor based in Europe. Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape. A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to. Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days. Vendors can also pay suppliers directly through wire transfers and pay for services like hosting using the MasterCard. However, customers can't fund their Payoneer account. While Payoneer likes the reputation of being ""a U.S bank account"" they really are not. They are a service that allows you to receive payment from companies. While individuals can send money from and to other Payoneer accounts, wire transfers to the account can only be done by a business. As a result of the Wirecard scandal, Payoneer now gives customers the option to choose to hold their funds on their MasterCard or on Payoneer own accounts. From u/-Jack-The-Lad: “Overall I think Payoneer is a good company. They have a lot of room for expansion and their market is beyond huge. One thing I am concerned about is the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny. As Payoneer grows, it will likely get noticed by countries and may face stricter regulations both in the U.S and abroad.” Fellow customer u/tonysoleoptions notes that Payoneer offers a no frills currency exchange service while is reliable and dependable. In terms of areas for improvement he cites the slower transaction times relative to PayPal and less than optimal reporting. Industry and market opportunity: B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, “scale” and “network effects”. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they’re benefitting from these dynamics but the disclosure could have been better (more about that below). Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.) Management team and investor base: Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at MasterCard and First Data, which is exactly what you want to see. As this Barron's article notes (h/t whmcpanel), unlike with an IPO, the sponsor and institutional investors get to look at the financials before making an investment decision. This is a crucial distinction for two reasons. First, you need to choose your SPAC carefully because you're relying on the sponsor to do thorough due diligence (DD). Second, if quality institutional investors participate, it generally means they like what they saw in their DD. On both accounts, Payoneer looks promising. Betsy Cohen is an industry leader in FinTech and Payoneer's institutional investor (II) base is high quality with IIs such as Dragoneer, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Millennium, T. Rowe, and Winslow Capital Management. Wellington Management, an existing investor, also participated. These are IIs who understand FinTech and like what they saw in their DD, which is an encouraging sign.  Business model: Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years. I would say all else equal flat revenue growth vs. decelerating volume growth is a good thing but again a deeper dive into the product mix is necessary. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed. While the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn’t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I’m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins. I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition related. As for the all-important unit-economics, the customer payback period is less than 12 months, which is nice. Disclosing CLTV would have been better. The company also noted net volume retention (i.e., same store comparison of customer Y/Y volume) is over 100% but did not disclose exactly what the percentage is. This is somewhat irrelevant since anything less than 100% and the company wouldn't be getting acquired. I found the SMB cohort volume on slide 27 interesting. While it's lacking a Y-axis for volume (ugh!), it's clear each year's cohort of customers are roughly following a similar trajectory although 2015 seems to be a slight outlier. Now, if the company would just disclose the unit economics for these cohorts, you'd have your investment decision made. I think at this point, you have to trust the quality of FTOC and the II's DD. As I suggested above, my guess is that they drilled down pretty heavily and liked what they saw. Finally, many are looking at Payoneer’s transaction fees to get a sense for the potential revenue opportunity. While this is logical, it is somewhat misleading because these services are considered low quality revenue as I note above (cf. the race to sub-1% fees in China). Similar to the CDN business, where moving traffic is a commodity while providing web acceleration and cloud security offer higher margins, Payoneer needs to upsell higher value added services to its customer base, which was initially attracted by the low service fees. Once again, Payoneer highlighted these value added services in its presentation Note: the adjusted numbers were a turnoff. Covid happened. If you're benefitting from the acceleration in cross-border traffic due to the pandemic, don't exclude those sectors or markets negatively impacted by said pandemic. I believe the company was done a disservice by its bankers here in trying to manipulate the numbers. Investors aren't stupid and if they are, they're not the ones you want. This massaging of the numbers coupled with the lack of PF shares outstanding is a little concerning. It's early and the deal isn't completed yet so I'll give management the benefit of the doubt. For now. Valuation: FinTech companies such as PayPal, Square, and Payoneer are valued on subscriber growth. The key metric which the analysts will judge the company on is customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her/its lifetime. (Analysts apply a similar approach to wireless companies and data center REITs where each new subscriber or data center build is viewed on a payback and NPV basis. Technically, these companies are valued on earnings, EBITDA or AFFO but its CLTV or customer NPV which determines the valuation multiple.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter. Based on FTOC's current share price of ~$13.50, Payoneer's current market cap is roughly $6bn, which assumes ~430mn total shares outstanding.* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares.) The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels. The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's promote and the 30m shares in earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading +30% above NAV. Investment Thesis: Majority of traffic stays within the network. In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer. Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends. As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated. Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate. The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky. Playing the long game. The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for. I can tell you based on several years in the VC industry that this is their number one issue. You have the funds for payroll but they're tied up in A/R. This is where Payoneer is currently focused and I think it will represent a significant competitive advantage relative to its competition. I would love to see Payoneer partner with an institution like SVB which caters to small and emerging companies. Expect M&A to figure into the company’s strategic plans as well. Quality Sponsor and II's. As I noted above, Payoneer has a blue chip II base who performed DD not available with an IPO. These IIs clearly liked what they saw. Investors should certainly do their own DD but note that there is some impressive names in the II base, which is encouraging. Attractive valuation. Payoneer’s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and ""adjusted"" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or ""expand"" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more ""a when rather than if"" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors. Risks: Competition. PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don’t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here. Customer risk. Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo). Regulatory. Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V. Crypto currency. At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if it's just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer. FX exposure. I’m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure. TLDR: While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer’s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or “expanding” in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. I believe Payoneer will significantly reward LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their $6bn market cap vs. PayPal's +$300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business assuming the transaction past regulatory scrutiny. My advice is to spend more time digging and in the meantime acquire a small position upon which to build. ******************** Disclosure & Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor.

Technically, these companies are valued on earnings, EBITDA or AFFO but its CLTV or customer NPV which determines the valuation multiple.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter. Based on FTOC's current share price of ~$13.50, Payoneer's current market cap is roughly $6bn, which assumes ~430mn total shares outstanding.* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares.) The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels. The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's promote and the 30m shares in earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading +30% above NAV. Investment Thesis: Majority of traffic stays within the network. In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer. Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends. As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated. Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate. The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky. Playing the long game. The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for. I can tell you based on several years in the VC industry that this is their number one issue. You have the funds for payroll but they're tied up in A/R. This is where Payoneer is currently focused and I think it will represent a significant competitive advantage relative to its competition. I would love to see Payoneer partner with an institution like SVB which caters to small and emerging companies. Expect M&A to figure into the company’s strategic plans as well. Quality Sponsor and II's. As I noted above, Payoneer has a blue chip II base who performed DD not available with an IPO. These IIs clearly liked what they saw. Investors should certainly do their own DD but note that there is some impressive names in the II base, which is encouraging. Attractive valuation. Payoneer’s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and ""adjusted"" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or ""expand"" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more ""a when rather than if"" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors. Risks: Competition. PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don’t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here. Customer risk. Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo). Regulatory. Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V. Crypto currency. At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if it's just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer. FX exposure. I’m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure. TLDR: While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer’s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or “expanding” in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. I believe Payoneer will significantly reward LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their $6bn market cap vs. PayPal's +$300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business assuming the transaction past regulatory scrutiny. My advice is to spend more time digging and in the meantime acquire a small position upon which to build. ******************** Disclosure & Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor.

,"Just to be upfront, I view Payoneer as a great long-term hold. I started acquiring PayPal shares in 2016 and haven't sold since. I see some parallels with Payoneer but patience is the key. This is not really a r/SPAC play as much as its a r/investing play. (No comment on r/WSB.) While getting added to ARKF would be nice for a near-term pop, sometimes lying low to get your act together is a good thing. PayPal benefitted from the same dynamic until investors realized the company's scale was enormous. (Obviously, the eBay relationship played a huge role but the stock traded in the $80-110 range for two years before Covid drove the stock up 3x.) There will come a point when investors realize Payoneer's opportunity, but right now the opportunity is buried under mediocre financials (see below) and a frothy SPAC market for which anything less than a 50% pop at DA is a dud. It's only when you dig deeper into the potential scale benefits and where the current investments are going that you realize this may be PayPal 2.0. Hence, thee current situation is actually a great opportunity for Payoneer investors. Obviously, I would encourage everyone to do their own DD starting with the investor presentation and webcast. I personally found the presentation short on key metrics and financial detail and long on buzz words. (I guess $95mn in bankers' fees only buys so much these days.) That said, the acquisition has yet to close and Payoneer needs to be prudent. I would also add that while I avoid stereotypes, Payoneer seems to be another addition to Israel's strong lineage and tradition of building great technology companies where the MO seems to be under-promise and over-deliver. ********* Payoneer (FTOC) Summary: Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at a reasonable entry point. What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team knows what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position. IMHO the key for the company (and the stock) is to better explain the customer ROI at the unit level and why investments now make sense from a CLTV sense. The company also needs to address flattish margins on 25% revenue growth and negative EBITDA after 15 years of operations. I think the company missed an excellent opportunity to frame the discussion out of the gate by highlighting the benefits of its scale with detailed customer metrics, e.g., subscriber acquisition costs (SAC), churn, and most importantly customer lifetime value (CLTV). These are really the metrics which matter to thoughtful investors as well as the usual financials. If this was an obvious play, it would be trading significantly higher. (Un)fortunately, most investors don't like complexity or have the patience to watch a good company become a great company. I think this may be a situation where really digging into the financials and business model could reward investors handsomely over time. That said, far more DD is needed as well as much more disclosure from the company before one can make a decision. I would encourage investors to take a modest position and then build on it as the DD validates. The acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021 at which point detailed financials should be available. Company: Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world). Customers: Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network. This blog post does a nice job of discussing Payoneer's entry into China, which looks promising. My concern with China is exactly what's happening, namely, the competition is driving down the price. PayPal entered with a 5% fee and the industry is now around 1%. The post quotes a VC who aptly sums up the situation: You don’t have to be the first, but you need to be better, cheaper and faster. This dynamic obviously has margin implications and also illustrates why higher-value services are important longer-term. Expect WorldFirst and AirWallex to continue to further drive this dynamic. I need to comment on Payoneer's customer service, which based on a perusal of r/Payoneer leaves something to be desired. First, the Wirecard scandal caused Payoneer to move to an Ireland-based bank, which has pretty onerous documentation requirements. Clearly this has upset a fair amount of vendors. I have no idea how many were impacted as a % of the total customer base but enough to warrant attention. I'm hoping this is a transitory issue but it obviously needs to be monitored. Second, the payments industry like the broadband industry is one in which if the service is not delivered seamlessly, customers will gripe to no end. (You hate your cable company but you NEED BB. You know it.) The only thing worse than BB latency is cash latency, i.e., a delay or freeze on your account. Clearly, the industry as a whole needs to do better. I can attest firsthand that vendor complaints about PayPal have reached a deafening level. However, as one disgruntled vendor notes, it's basically a two horse race. There is no third option. Assuming that's the case, I like Payoneer's position given its lower fees and better service on a relative basis than PayPal. Again, I want to see customer service scores moving in the right direction. No question. But the industry has come a long way from Western Union. Customer service. After spending some time on the r/Payoneer sub-reddit, I have two initial impressions. While the Wirecard scandal caused a headache for Payoneer’s customers, it seems to be a transitory issue. The Wirecard scandal aside, Payoneer’s customer service is less than perfect and needs to improve. (Note: few people go out of their way to praise a bank or their cable company for seamlessly delivering the services the customers pay for. Please keep that in mind when browsing r/Payoneer.) User feedback. I would very much like to thank u/-Jack-The-Lad, who provided some really great insights into his experience using Payoneer as a vendor based in Europe. Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape. A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to. Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days. Vendors can also pay suppliers directly through wire transfers and pay for services like hosting using the MasterCard. However, customers can't fund their Payoneer account. While Payoneer likes the reputation of being ""a U.S bank account"" they really are not. They are a service that allows you to receive payment from companies. While individuals can send money from and to other Payoneer accounts, wire transfers to the account can only be done by a business. As a result of the Wirecard scandal, Payoneer now gives customers the option to choose to hold their funds on their MasterCard or on Payoneer own accounts. From u/-Jack-The-Lad: “Overall I think Payoneer is a good company. They have a lot of room for expansion and their market is beyond huge. One thing I am concerned about is the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny. As Payoneer grows, it will likely get noticed by countries and may face stricter regulations both in the U.S and abroad.” Fellow customer u/tonysoleoptions notes that Payoneer offers a no frills currency exchange service while is reliable and dependable. In terms of areas for improvement he cites the slower transaction times relative to PayPal and less than optimal reporting. Industry and market opportunity: B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, “scale” and “network effects”. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they’re benefitting from these dynamics but the disclosure could have been better (more about that below). Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.) Management team and investor base: Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at MasterCard and First Data, which is exactly what you want to see. As this Barron's article notes (h/t whmcpanel), unlike with an IPO, the sponsor and institutional investors get to look at the financials before making an investment decision. This is a crucial distinction for two reasons. First, you need to choose your SPAC carefully because you're relying on the sponsor to do thorough due diligence (DD). Second, if quality institutional investors participate, it generally means they like what they saw in their DD. On both accounts, Payoneer looks promising. Betsy Cohen is an industry leader in FinTech and Payoneer's institutional investor (II) base is high quality with IIs such as Dragoneer, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Millennium, T. Rowe, and Winslow Capital Management. Wellington Management, an existing investor, also participated. These are IIs who understand FinTech and like what they saw in their DD, which is an encouraging sign.  Business model: Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years. I would say all else equal flat revenue growth vs. decelerating volume growth is a good thing but again a deeper dive into the product mix is necessary. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed. While the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn’t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I’m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins. I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition related. As for the all-important unit-economics, the customer payback period is less than 12 months, which is nice. Disclosing CLTV would have been better. The company also noted net volume retention (i.e., same store comparison of customer Y/Y volume) is over 100% but did not disclose exactly what the percentage is. This is somewhat irrelevant since anything less than 100% and the company wouldn't be getting acquired. I found the SMB cohort volume on slide 27 interesting. While it's lacking a Y-axis for volume (ugh!), it's clear each year's cohort of customers are roughly following a similar trajectory although 2015 seems to be a slight outlier. Now, if the company would just disclose the unit economics for these cohorts, you'd have your investment decision made. I think at this point, you have to trust the quality of FTOC and the II's DD. As I suggested above, my guess is that they drilled down pretty heavily and liked what they saw. Finally, many are looking at Payoneer’s transaction fees to get a sense for the potential revenue opportunity. While this is logical, it is somewhat misleading because these services are considered low quality revenue as I note above (cf. the race to sub-1% fees in China). Similar to the CDN business, where moving traffic is a commodity while providing web acceleration and cloud security offer higher margins, Payoneer needs to upsell higher value added services to its customer base, which was initially attracted by the low service fees. Once again, Payoneer highlighted these value added services in its presentation Note: the adjusted numbers were a turnoff. Covid happened. If you're benefitting from the acceleration in cross-border traffic due to the pandemic, don't exclude those sectors or markets negatively impacted by said pandemic. I believe the company was done a disservice by its bankers here in trying to manipulate the numbers. Investors aren't stupid and if they are, they're not the ones you want. This massaging of the numbers coupled with the lack of PF shares outstanding is a little concerning. It's early and the deal isn't completed yet so I'll give management the benefit of the doubt. For now. Valuation: FinTech companies such as PayPal, Square, and Payoneer are valued on subscriber growth. The key metric which the analysts will judge the company on is customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her/its lifetime. (Analysts apply a similar approach to wireless companies and data center REITs where each new subscriber or data center build is viewed on a payback and NPV basis. Technically, these companies are valued on earnings, EBITDA or AFFO but its CLTV or customer NPV which determines the valuation multiple.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter. Based on FTOC's current share price of ~$13.50, Payoneer's current market cap is roughly $6bn, which assumes ~430mn total shares outstanding.* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares.) The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels. The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's promote and the 30m shares in earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading +30% above NAV. Investment Thesis: Majority of traffic stays within the network. In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers.

After spending some time on the r/Payoneer sub-reddit, I have two initial impressions. While the Wirecard scandal caused a headache for Payoneer’s customers, it seems to be a transitory issue. The Wirecard scandal aside, Payoneer’s customer service is less than perfect and needs to improve. (Note: few people go out of their way to praise a bank or their cable company for seamlessly delivering the services the customers pay for. Please keep that in mind when browsing r/Payoneer.) User feedback. I would very much like to thank u/-Jack-The-Lad, who provided some really great insights into his experience using Payoneer as a vendor based in Europe. Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape. A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to. Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days. Vendors can also pay suppliers directly through wire transfers and pay for services like hosting using the MasterCard. However, customers can't fund their Payoneer account. While Payoneer likes the reputation of being ""a U.S bank account"" they really are not. They are a service that allows you to receive payment from companies. While individuals can send money from and to other Payoneer accounts, wire transfers to the account can only be done by a business. As a result of the Wirecard scandal, Payoneer now gives customers the option to choose to hold their funds on their MasterCard or on Payoneer own accounts. From u/-Jack-The-Lad: “Overall I think Payoneer is a good company. They have a lot of room for expansion and their market is beyond huge. One thing I am concerned about is the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny. As Payoneer grows, it will likely get noticed by countries and may face stricter regulations both in the U.S and abroad.” Fellow customer u/tonysoleoptions notes that Payoneer offers a no frills currency exchange service while is reliable and dependable. In terms of areas for improvement he cites the slower transaction times relative to PayPal and less than optimal reporting. Industry and market opportunity: B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, “scale” and “network effects”. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they’re benefitting from these dynamics but the disclosure could have been better (more about that below). Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.) Management team and investor base: Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at MasterCard and First Data, which is exactly what you want to see. As this Barron's article notes (h/t whmcpanel), unlike with an IPO, the sponsor and institutional investors get to look at the financials before making an investment decision. This is a crucial distinction for two reasons. First, you need to choose your SPAC carefully because you're relying on the sponsor to do thorough due diligence (DD). Second, if quality institutional investors participate, it generally means they like what they saw in their DD. On both accounts, Payoneer looks promising. Betsy Cohen is an industry leader in FinTech and Payoneer's institutional investor (II) base is high quality with IIs such as Dragoneer, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Millennium, T. Rowe, and Winslow Capital Management. Wellington Management, an existing investor, also participated. These are IIs who understand FinTech and like what they saw in their DD, which is an encouraging sign.  Business model: Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years. I would say all else equal flat revenue growth vs. decelerating volume growth is a good thing but again a deeper dive into the product mix is necessary. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed. While the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn’t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I’m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins. I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition related. As for the all-important unit-economics, the customer payback period is less than 12 months, which is nice. Disclosing CLTV would have been better. The company also noted net volume retention (i.e., same store comparison of customer Y/Y volume) is over 100% but did not disclose exactly what the percentage is. This is somewhat irrelevant since anything less than 100% and the company wouldn't be getting acquired. I found the SMB cohort volume on slide 27 interesting. While it's lacking a Y-axis for volume (ugh!), it's clear each year's cohort of customers are roughly following a similar trajectory although 2015 seems to be a slight outlier. Now, if the company would just disclose the unit economics for these cohorts, you'd have your investment decision made. I think at this point, you have to trust the quality of FTOC and the II's DD. As I suggested above, my guess is that they drilled down pretty heavily and liked what they saw. Finally, many are looking at Payoneer’s transaction fees to get a sense for the potential revenue opportunity. While this is logical, it is somewhat misleading because these services are considered low quality revenue as I note above (cf. the race to sub-1% fees in China). Similar to the CDN business, where moving traffic is a commodity while providing web acceleration and cloud security offer higher margins, Payoneer needs to upsell higher value added services to its customer base, which was initially attracted by the low service fees. Once again, Payoneer highlighted these value added services in its presentation Note: the adjusted numbers were a turnoff. Covid happened. If you're benefitting from the acceleration in cross-border traffic due to the pandemic, don't exclude those sectors or markets negatively impacted by said pandemic. I believe the company was done a disservice by its bankers here in trying to manipulate the numbers. Investors aren't stupid and if they are, they're not the ones you want. This massaging of the numbers coupled with the lack of PF shares outstanding is a little concerning. It's early and the deal isn't completed yet so I'll give management the benefit of the doubt. For now. Valuation: FinTech companies such as PayPal, Square, and Payoneer are valued on subscriber growth. The key metric which the analysts will judge the company on is customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her/its lifetime. (Analysts apply a similar approach to wireless companies and data center REITs where each new subscriber or data center build is viewed on a payback and NPV basis. Technically, these companies are valued on earnings, EBITDA or AFFO but its CLTV or customer NPV which determines the valuation multiple.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter. Based on FTOC's current share price of ~$13.50, Payoneer's current market cap is roughly $6bn, which assumes ~430mn total shares outstanding.* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares.) The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels. The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's promote and the 30m shares in earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading +30% above NAV. Investment Thesis: Majority of traffic stays within the network. In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer. Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends. As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated. Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate. The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky. Playing the long game. The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for. I can tell you based on several years in the VC industry that this is their number one issue. You have the funds for payroll but they're tied up in A/R. This is where Payoneer is currently focused and I think it will represent a significant competitive advantage relative to its competition. I would love to see Payoneer partner with an institution like SVB which caters to small and emerging companies. Expect M&A to figure into the company’s strategic plans as well. Quality Sponsor and II's. As I noted above, Payoneer has a blue chip II base who performed DD not available with an IPO. These IIs clearly liked what they saw. Investors should certainly do their own DD but note that there is some impressive names in the II base, which is encouraging. Attractive valuation. Payoneer’s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and ""adjusted"" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or ""expand"" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more ""a when rather than if"" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors. Risks: Competition. PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don’t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here. Customer risk. Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo). Regulatory. Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V. Crypto currency. At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if it's just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer. FX exposure. I’m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure. TLDR: While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer’s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or “expanding” in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. I believe Payoneer will significantly reward LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their $6bn market cap vs. PayPal's +$300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business assuming the transaction past regulatory scrutiny. My advice is to spend more time digging and in the meantime acquire a small position upon which to build. ******************** Disclosure & Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor.

,"Just to be upfront, I view Payoneer as a great long-term hold. I started acquiring PayPal shares in 2016 and haven't sold since. I see some parallels with Payoneer but patience is the key. This is not really a r/SPAC play as much as its a r/investing play. (No comment on r/WSB.) While getting added to ARKF would be nice for a near-term pop, sometimes lying low to get your act together is a good thing. PayPal benefitted from the same dynamic until investors realized the company's scale was enormous. (Obviously, the eBay relationship played a huge role but the stock traded in the $80-110 range for two years before Covid drove the stock up 3x.) There will come a point when investors realize Payoneer's opportunity, but right now the opportunity is buried under mediocre financials (see below) and a frothy SPAC market for which anything less than a 50% pop at DA is a dud. It's only when you dig deeper into the potential scale benefits and where the current investments are going that you realize this may be PayPal 2.0. Hence, thee current situation is actually a great opportunity for Payoneer investors. Obviously, I would encourage everyone to do their own DD starting with the investor presentation and webcast. I personally found the presentation short on key metrics and financial detail and long on buzz words. (I guess $95mn in bankers' fees only buys so much these days.) That said, the acquisition has yet to close and Payoneer needs to be prudent. I would also add that while I avoid stereotypes, Payoneer seems to be another addition to Israel's strong lineage and tradition of building great technology companies where the MO seems to be under-promise and over-deliver. ********* Payoneer (FTOC) Summary: Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at a reasonable entry point. What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team knows what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position. IMHO the key for the company (and the stock) is to better explain the customer ROI at the unit level and why investments now make sense from a CLTV sense. The company also needs to address flattish margins on 25% revenue growth and negative EBITDA after 15 years of operations. I think the company missed an excellent opportunity to frame the discussion out of the gate by highlighting the benefits of its scale with detailed customer metrics, e.g., subscriber acquisition costs (SAC), churn, and most importantly customer lifetime value (CLTV). These are really the metrics which matter to thoughtful investors as well as the usual financials. If this was an obvious play, it would be trading significantly higher. (Un)fortunately, most investors don't like complexity or have the patience to watch a good company become a great company. I think this may be a situation where really digging into the financials and business model could reward investors handsomely over time. That said, far more DD is needed as well as much more disclosure from the company before one can make a decision. I would encourage investors to take a modest position and then build on it as the DD validates. The acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021 at which point detailed financials should be available. Company: Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world). Customers: Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network. This blog post does a nice job of discussing Payoneer's entry into China, which looks promising. My concern with China is exactly what's happening, namely, the competition is driving down the price. PayPal entered with a 5% fee and the industry is now around 1%. The post quotes a VC who aptly sums up the situation: You don’t have to be the first, but you need to be better, cheaper and faster. This dynamic obviously has margin implications and also illustrates why higher-value services are important longer-term. Expect WorldFirst and AirWallex to continue to further drive this dynamic. I need to comment on Payoneer's customer service, which based on a perusal of r/Payoneer leaves something to be desired. First, the Wirecard scandal caused Payoneer to move to an Ireland-based bank, which has pretty onerous documentation requirements. Clearly this has upset a fair amount of vendors. I have no idea how many were impacted as a % of the total customer base but enough to warrant attention. I'm hoping this is a transitory issue but it obviously needs to be monitored. Second, the payments industry like the broadband industry is one in which if the service is not delivered seamlessly, customers will gripe to no end. (You hate your cable company but you NEED BB. You know it.) The only thing worse than BB latency is cash latency, i.e., a delay or freeze on your account. Clearly, the industry as a whole needs to do better. I can attest firsthand that vendor complaints about PayPal have reached a deafening level. However, as one disgruntled vendor notes, it's basically a two horse race. There is no third option. Assuming that's the case, I like Payoneer's position given its lower fees and better service on a relative basis than PayPal. Again, I want to see customer service scores moving in the right direction. No question. But the industry has come a long way from Western Union. Customer service. After spending some time on the r/Payoneer sub-reddit, I have two initial impressions. While the Wirecard scandal caused a headache for Payoneer’s customers, it seems to be a transitory issue.

As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky. Playing the long game. The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth.

Payoneer’s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies.

However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this.

Regulatory. Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V. Crypto currency. At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if it's just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer. FX exposure. I’m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure. TLDR: While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer’s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or “expanding” in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. I believe Payoneer will significantly reward LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their $6bn market cap vs. PayPal's +$300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business assuming the transaction past regulatory scrutiny. My advice is to spend more time digging and in the meantime acquire a small position upon which to build. ******************** Disclosure & Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor.

,"Just to be upfront, I view Payoneer as a great long-term hold. I started acquiring PayPal shares in 2016 and haven't sold since. I see some parallels with Payoneer but patience is the key. This is not really a r/SPAC play as much as its a r/investing play. (No comment on r/WSB.) While getting added to ARKF would be nice for a near-term pop, sometimes lying low to get your act together is a good thing. PayPal benefitted from the same dynamic until investors realized the company's scale was enormous. (Obviously, the eBay relationship played a huge role but the stock traded in the $80-110 range for two years before Covid drove the stock up 3x.) There will come a point when investors realize Payoneer's opportunity, but right now the opportunity is buried under mediocre financials (see below) and a frothy SPAC market for which anything less than a 50% pop at DA is a dud. It's only when you dig deeper into the potential scale benefits and where the current investments are going that you realize this may be PayPal 2.0. Hence, thee current situation is actually a great opportunity for Payoneer investors. Obviously, I would encourage everyone to do their own DD starting with the investor presentation and webcast. I personally found the presentation short on key metrics and financial detail and long on buzz words. (I guess $95mn in bankers' fees only buys so much these days.) That said, the acquisition has yet to close and Payoneer needs to be prudent. I would also add that while I avoid stereotypes, Payoneer seems to be another addition to Israel's strong lineage and tradition of building great technology companies where the MO seems to be under-promise and over-deliver. ********* Payoneer (FTOC) Summary: Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at a reasonable entry point. What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team knows what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position. IMHO the key for the company (and the stock) is to better explain the customer ROI at the unit level and why investments now make sense from a CLTV sense. The company also needs to address flattish margins on 25% revenue growth and negative EBITDA after 15 years of operations. I think the company missed an excellent opportunity to frame the discussion out of the gate by highlighting the benefits of its scale with detailed customer metrics, e.g., subscriber acquisition costs (SAC), churn, and most importantly customer lifetime value (CLTV). These are really the metrics which matter to thoughtful investors as well as the usual financials. If this was an obvious play, it would be trading significantly higher. (Un)fortunately, most investors don't like complexity or have the patience to watch a good company become a great company. I think this may be a situation where really digging into the financials and business model could reward investors handsomely over time. That said, far more DD is needed as well as much more disclosure from the company before one can make a decision. I would encourage investors to take a modest position and then build on it as the DD validates. The acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021 at which point detailed financials should be available. Company: Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world). Customers: Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network. This blog post does a nice job of discussing Payoneer's entry into China, which looks promising. My concern with China is exactly what's happening, namely, the competition is driving down the price. PayPal entered with a 5% fee and the industry is now around 1%. The post quotes a VC who aptly sums up the situation: You don’t have to be the first, but you need to be better, cheaper and faster. This dynamic obviously has margin implications and also illustrates why higher-value services are important longer-term. Expect WorldFirst and AirWallex to continue to further drive this dynamic. I need to comment on Payoneer's customer service, which based on a perusal of r/Payoneer leaves something to be desired. First, the Wirecard scandal caused Payoneer to move to an Ireland-based bank, which has pretty onerous documentation requirements. Clearly this has upset a fair amount of vendors. I have no idea how many were impacted as a % of the total customer base but enough to warrant attention. I'm hoping this is a transitory issue but it obviously needs to be monitored. Second, the payments industry like the broadband industry is one in which if the service is not delivered seamlessly, customers will gripe to no end. (You hate your cable company but you NEED BB. You know it.) The only thing worse than BB latency is cash latency, i.e., a delay or freeze on your account. Clearly, the industry as a whole needs to do better. I can attest firsthand that vendor complaints about PayPal have reached a deafening level. However, as one disgruntled vendor notes, it's basically a two horse race. There is no third option. Assuming that's the case, I like Payoneer's position given its lower fees and better service on a relative basis than PayPal. Again, I want to see customer service scores moving in the right direction. No question. But the industry has come a long way from Western Union. Customer service. After spending some time on the r/Payoneer sub-reddit, I have two initial impressions. While the Wirecard scandal caused a headache for Payoneer’s customers, it seems to be a transitory issue. The Wirecard scandal aside, Payoneer’s customer service is less than perfect and needs to improve. (Note: few people go out of their way to praise a bank or their cable company for seamlessly delivering the services the customers pay for. Please keep that in mind when browsing r/Payoneer.) User feedback. I would very much like to thank u/-Jack-The-Lad, who provided some really great insights into his experience using Payoneer as a vendor based in Europe. Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape. A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to. Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days. Vendors can also pay suppliers directly through wire transfers and pay for services like hosting using the MasterCard. However, customers can't fund their Payoneer account. While Payoneer likes the reputation of being ""a U.S bank account"" they really are not. They are a service that allows you to receive payment from companies. While individuals can send money from and to other Payoneer accounts, wire transfers to the account can only be done by a business. As a result of the Wirecard scandal, Payoneer now gives customers the option to choose to hold their funds on their MasterCard or on Payoneer own accounts. From u/-Jack-The-Lad: “Overall I think Payoneer is a good company. They have a lot of room for expansion and their market is beyond huge. One thing I am concerned about is the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny. As Payoneer grows, it will likely get noticed by countries and may face stricter regulations both in the U.S and abroad.” Fellow customer u/tonysoleoptions notes that Payoneer offers a no frills currency exchange service while is reliable and dependable. In terms of areas for improvement he cites the slower transaction times relative to PayPal and less than optimal reporting. Industry and market opportunity: B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, “scale” and “network effects”. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they’re benefitting from these dynamics but the disclosure could have been better (more about that below). Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.) Management team and investor base: Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at MasterCard and First Data, which is exactly what you want to see. As this Barron's article notes (h/t whmcpanel), unlike with an IPO, the sponsor and institutional investors get to look at the financials before making an investment decision. This is a crucial distinction for two reasons. First, you need to choose your SPAC carefully because you're relying on the sponsor to do thorough due diligence (DD). Second, if quality institutional investors participate, it generally means they like what they saw in their DD. On both accounts, Payoneer looks promising. Betsy Cohen is an industry leader in FinTech and Payoneer's institutional investor (II) base is high quality with IIs such as Dragoneer, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Millennium, T. Rowe, and Winslow Capital Management. Wellington Management, an existing investor, also participated. These are IIs who understand FinTech and like what they saw in their DD, which is an encouraging sign.  Business model: Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years. I would say all else equal flat revenue growth vs. decelerating volume growth is a good thing but again a deeper dive into the product mix is necessary. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed. While the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn’t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I’m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins. I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition related. As for the all-important unit-economics, the customer payback period is less than 12 months, which is nice. Disclosing CLTV would have been better. The company also noted net volume retention (i.e., same store comparison of customer Y/Y volume) is over 100% but did not disclose exactly what the percentage is. This is somewhat irrelevant since anything less than 100% and the company wouldn't be getting acquired. I found the SMB cohort volume on slide 27 interesting. While it's lacking a Y-axis for volume (ugh!), it's clear each year's cohort of customers are roughly following a similar trajectory although 2015 seems to be a slight outlier. Now, if the company would just disclose the unit economics for these cohorts, you'd have your investment decision made. I think at this point, you have to trust the quality of FTOC and the II's DD. As I suggested above, my guess is that they drilled down pretty heavily and liked what they saw. Finally, many are looking at Payoneer’s transaction fees to get a sense for the potential revenue opportunity. While this is logical, it is somewhat misleading because these services are considered low quality revenue as I note above (cf. the race to sub-1% fees in China). Similar to the CDN business, where moving traffic is a commodity while providing web acceleration and cloud security offer higher margins, Payoneer needs to upsell higher value added services to its customer base, which was initially attracted by the low service fees. Once again, Payoneer highlighted these value added services in its presentation Note: the adjusted numbers were a turnoff. Covid happened. If you're benefitting from the acceleration in cross-border traffic due to the pandemic, don't exclude those sectors or markets negatively impacted by said pandemic. I believe the company was done a disservice by its bankers here in trying to manipulate the numbers. Investors aren't stupid and if they are, they're not the ones you want. This massaging of the numbers coupled with the lack of PF shares outstanding is a little concerning. It's early and the deal isn't completed yet so I'll give management the benefit of the doubt. For now. Valuation: FinTech companies such as PayPal, Square, and Payoneer are valued on subscriber growth. The key metric which the analysts will judge the company on is customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her/its lifetime. (Analysts apply a similar approach to wireless companies and data center REITs where each new subscriber or data center build is viewed on a payback and NPV basis. Technically, these companies are valued on earnings, EBITDA or AFFO but its CLTV or customer NPV which determines the valuation multiple.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter. Based on FTOC's current share price of ~$13.50, Payoneer's current market cap is roughly $6bn, which assumes ~430mn total shares outstanding.* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares.) The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels. The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's promote and the 30m shares in earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading +30% above NAV. Investment Thesis: Majority of traffic stays within the network. In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer. Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends. As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated. Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate. The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky. Playing the long game. The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for. I can tell you based on several years in the VC industry that this is their number one issue. You have the funds for payroll but they're tied up in A/R. This is where Payoneer is currently focused and I think it will represent a significant competitive advantage relative to its competition. I would love to see Payoneer partner with an institution like SVB which caters to small and emerging companies. Expect M&A to figure into the company’s strategic plans as well. Quality Sponsor and II's. As I noted above, Payoneer has a blue chip II base who performed DD not available with an IPO. These IIs clearly liked what they saw. Investors should certainly do their own DD but note that there is some impressive names in the II base, which is encouraging. Attractive valuation. Payoneer’s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and ""adjusted"" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or ""expand"" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more ""a when rather than if"" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors. Risks: Competition. PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don’t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here. Customer risk. Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo). Regulatory. Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V. Crypto currency.

While the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn’t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I’m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins. I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition related. As for the all-important unit-economics, the customer payback period is less than 12 months, which is nice. Disclosing CLTV would have been better. The company also noted net volume retention (i.e., same store comparison of customer Y/Y volume) is over 100% but did not disclose exactly what the percentage is. This is somewhat irrelevant since anything less than 100% and the company wouldn't be getting acquired. I found the SMB cohort volume on slide 27 interesting. While it's lacking a Y-axis for volume (ugh!), it's clear each year's cohort of customers are roughly following a similar trajectory although 2015 seems to be a slight outlier. Now, if the company would just disclose the unit economics for these cohorts, you'd have your investment decision made. I think at this point, you have to trust the quality of FTOC and the II's DD. As I suggested above, my guess is that they drilled down pretty heavily and liked what they saw. Finally, many are looking at Payoneer’s transaction fees to get a sense for the potential revenue opportunity. While this is logical, it is somewhat misleading because these services are considered low quality revenue as I note above (cf. the race to sub-1% fees in China). Similar to the CDN business, where moving traffic is a commodity while providing web acceleration and cloud security offer higher margins, Payoneer needs to upsell higher value added services to its customer base, which was initially attracted by the low service fees. Once again, Payoneer highlighted these value added services in its presentation Note: the adjusted numbers were a turnoff. Covid happened. If you're benefitting from the acceleration in cross-border traffic due to the pandemic, don't exclude those sectors or markets negatively impacted by said pandemic. I believe the company was done a disservice by its bankers here in trying to manipulate the numbers. Investors aren't stupid and if they are, they're not the ones you want. This massaging of the numbers coupled with the lack of PF shares outstanding is a little concerning. It's early and the deal isn't completed yet so I'll give management the benefit of the doubt. For now. Valuation: FinTech companies such as PayPal, Square, and Payoneer are valued on subscriber growth. The key metric which the analysts will judge the company on is customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her/its lifetime. (Analysts apply a similar approach to wireless companies and data center REITs where each new subscriber or data center build is viewed on a payback and NPV basis. Technically, these companies are valued on earnings, EBITDA or AFFO but its CLTV or customer NPV which determines the valuation multiple.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter. Based on FTOC's current share price of ~$13.50, Payoneer's current market cap is roughly $6bn, which assumes ~430mn total shares outstanding.* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares.) The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels. The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's promote and the 30m shares in earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading +30% above NAV. Investment Thesis: Majority of traffic stays within the network. In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer. Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends. As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated. Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate. The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky. Playing the long game. The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for. I can tell you based on several years in the VC industry that this is their number one issue. You have the funds for payroll but they're tied up in A/R. This is where Payoneer is currently focused and I think it will represent a significant competitive advantage relative to its competition. I would love to see Payoneer partner with an institution like SVB which caters to small and emerging companies. Expect M&A to figure into the company’s strategic plans as well. Quality Sponsor and II's. As I noted above, Payoneer has a blue chip II base who performed DD not available with an IPO. These IIs clearly liked what they saw. Investors should certainly do their own DD but note that there is some impressive names in the II base, which is encouraging. Attractive valuation. Payoneer’s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and ""adjusted"" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or ""expand"" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more ""a when rather than if"" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors. Risks: Competition. PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don’t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here. Customer risk. Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo). Regulatory. Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V. Crypto currency. At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if it's just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer. FX exposure. I’m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure. TLDR: While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer’s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or “expanding” in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. I believe Payoneer will significantly reward LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their $6bn market cap vs. PayPal's +$300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business assuming the transaction past regulatory scrutiny. My advice is to spend more time digging and in the meantime acquire a small position upon which to build. ******************** Disclosure & Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor.

,"Just to be upfront, I view Payoneer as a great long-term hold. I started acquiring PayPal shares in 2016 and haven't sold since. I see some parallels with Payoneer but patience is the key. This is not really a r/SPAC play as much as its a r/investing play. (No comment on r/WSB.) While getting added to ARKF would be nice for a near-term pop, sometimes lying low to get your act together is a good thing. PayPal benefitted from the same dynamic until investors realized the company's scale was enormous. (Obviously, the eBay relationship played a huge role but the stock traded in the $80-110 range for two years before Covid drove the stock up 3x.) There will come a point when investors realize Payoneer's opportunity, but right now the opportunity is buried under mediocre financials (see below) and a frothy SPAC market for which anything less than a 50% pop at DA is a dud. It's only when you dig deeper into the potential scale benefits and where the current investments are going that you realize this may be PayPal 2.0. Hence, thee current situation is actually a great opportunity for Payoneer investors. Obviously, I would encourage everyone to do their own DD starting with the investor presentation and webcast. I personally found the presentation short on key metrics and financial detail and long on buzz words. (I guess $95mn in bankers' fees only buys so much these days.) That said, the acquisition has yet to close and Payoneer needs to be prudent. I would also add that while I avoid stereotypes, Payoneer seems to be another addition to Israel's strong lineage and tradition of building great technology companies where the MO seems to be under-promise and over-deliver. ********* Payoneer (FTOC) Summary: Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at a reasonable entry point. What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team knows what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position. IMHO the key for the company (and the stock) is to better explain the customer ROI at the unit level and why investments now make sense from a CLTV sense. The company also needs to address flattish margins on 25% revenue growth and negative EBITDA after 15 years of operations. I think the company missed an excellent opportunity to frame the discussion out of the gate by highlighting the benefits of its scale with detailed customer metrics, e.g., subscriber acquisition costs (SAC), churn, and most importantly customer lifetime value (CLTV). These are really the metrics which matter to thoughtful investors as well as the usual financials. If this was an obvious play, it would be trading significantly higher. (Un)fortunately, most investors don't like complexity or have the patience to watch a good company become a great company. I think this may be a situation where really digging into the financials and business model could reward investors handsomely over time. That said, far more DD is needed as well as much more disclosure from the company before one can make a decision. I would encourage investors to take a modest position and then build on it as the DD validates. The acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021 at which point detailed financials should be available. Company: Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world). Customers: Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network. This blog post does a nice job of discussing Payoneer's entry into China, which looks promising. My concern with China is exactly what's happening, namely, the competition is driving down the price. PayPal entered with a 5% fee and the industry is now around 1%. The post quotes a VC who aptly sums up the situation: You don’t have to be the first, but you need to be better, cheaper and faster. This dynamic obviously has margin implications and also illustrates why higher-value services are important longer-term. Expect WorldFirst and AirWallex to continue to further drive this dynamic. I need to comment on Payoneer's customer service, which based on a perusal of r/Payoneer leaves something to be desired. First, the Wirecard scandal caused Payoneer to move to an Ireland-based bank, which has pretty onerous documentation requirements. Clearly this has upset a fair amount of vendors. I have no idea how many were impacted as a % of the total customer base but enough to warrant attention. I'm hoping this is a transitory issue but it obviously needs to be monitored. Second, the payments industry like the broadband industry is one in which if the service is not delivered seamlessly, customers will gripe to no end. (You hate your cable company but you NEED BB. You know it.) The only thing worse than BB latency is cash latency, i.e., a delay or freeze on your account. Clearly, the industry as a whole needs to do better. I can attest firsthand that vendor complaints about PayPal have reached a deafening level. However, as one disgruntled vendor notes, it's basically a two horse race. There is no third option. Assuming that's the case, I like Payoneer's position given its lower fees and better service on a relative basis than PayPal. Again, I want to see customer service scores moving in the right direction. No question. But the industry has come a long way from Western Union. Customer service. After spending some time on the r/Payoneer sub-reddit, I have two initial impressions. While the Wirecard scandal caused a headache for Payoneer’s customers, it seems to be a transitory issue. The Wirecard scandal aside, Payoneer’s customer service is less than perfect and needs to improve. (Note: few people go out of their way to praise a bank or their cable company for seamlessly delivering the services the customers pay for. Please keep that in mind when browsing r/Payoneer.) User feedback. I would very much like to thank u/-Jack-The-Lad, who provided some really great insights into his experience using Payoneer as a vendor based in Europe. Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape. A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to. Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days. Vendors can also pay suppliers directly through wire transfers and pay for services like hosting using the MasterCard. However, customers can't fund their Payoneer account. While Payoneer likes the reputation of being ""a U.S bank account"" they really are not. They are a service that allows you to receive payment from companies. While individuals can send money from and to other Payoneer accounts, wire transfers to the account can only be done by a business. As a result of the Wirecard scandal, Payoneer now gives customers the option to choose to hold their funds on their MasterCard or on Payoneer own accounts. From u/-Jack-The-Lad: “Overall I think Payoneer is a good company. They have a lot of room for expansion and their market is beyond huge. One thing I am concerned about is the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny. As Payoneer grows, it will likely get noticed by countries and may face stricter regulations both in the U.S and abroad.” Fellow customer u/tonysoleoptions notes that Payoneer offers a no frills currency exchange service while is reliable and dependable. In terms of areas for improvement he cites the slower transaction times relative to PayPal and less than optimal reporting. Industry and market opportunity: B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, “scale” and “network effects”. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they’re benefitting from these dynamics but the disclosure could have been better (more about that below). Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.) Management team and investor base: Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at MasterCard and First Data, which is exactly what you want to see. As this Barron's article notes (h/t whmcpanel), unlike with an IPO, the sponsor and institutional investors get to look at the financials before making an investment decision. This is a crucial distinction for two reasons. First, you need to choose your SPAC carefully because you're relying on the sponsor to do thorough due diligence (DD). Second, if quality institutional investors participate, it generally means they like what they saw in their DD. On both accounts, Payoneer looks promising. Betsy Cohen is an industry leader in FinTech and Payoneer's institutional investor (II) base is high quality with IIs such as Dragoneer, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Millennium, T. Rowe, and Winslow Capital Management. Wellington Management, an existing investor, also participated. These are IIs who understand FinTech and like what they saw in their DD, which is an encouraging sign.  Business model: Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years. I would say all else equal flat revenue growth vs. decelerating volume growth is a good thing but again a deeper dive into the product mix is necessary. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed. While the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn’t elaborate here.

I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition related.

This is somewhat irrelevant since anything less than 100% and the company wouldn't be getting acquired. I found the SMB cohort volume on slide 27 interesting. While it's lacking a Y-axis for volume (ugh!), it's clear each year's cohort of customers are roughly following a similar trajectory although 2015 seems to be a slight outlier. Now, if the company would just disclose the unit economics for these cohorts, you'd have your investment decision made. I think at this point, you have to trust the quality of FTOC and the II's DD. As I suggested above, my guess is that they drilled down pretty heavily and liked what they saw.

What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team knows what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position. IMHO the key for the company (and the stock) is to better explain the customer ROI at the unit level and why investments now make sense from a CLTV sense. The company also needs to address flattish margins on 25% revenue growth and negative EBITDA after 15 years of operations. I think the company missed an excellent opportunity to frame the discussion out of the gate by highlighting the benefits of its scale with detailed customer metrics, e.g., subscriber acquisition costs (SAC), churn, and most importantly customer lifetime value (CLTV). These are really the metrics which matter to thoughtful investors as well as the usual financials. If this was an obvious play, it would be trading significantly higher. (Un)fortunately, most investors don't like complexity or have the patience to watch a good company become a great company. I think this may be a situation where really digging into the financials and business model could reward investors handsomely over time. That said, far more DD is needed as well as much more disclosure from the company before one can make a decision. I would encourage investors to take a modest position and then build on it as the DD validates. The acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021 at which point detailed financials should be available. Company: Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world). Customers: Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network. This blog post does a nice job of discussing Payoneer's entry into China, which looks promising. My concern with China is exactly what's happening, namely, the competition is driving down the price. PayPal entered with a 5% fee and the industry is now around 1%. The post quotes a VC who aptly sums up the situation: You don’t have to be the first, but you need to be better, cheaper and faster. This dynamic obviously has margin implications and also illustrates why higher-value services are important longer-term. Expect WorldFirst and AirWallex to continue to further drive this dynamic. I need to comment on Payoneer's customer service, which based on a perusal of r/Payoneer leaves something to be desired. First, the Wirecard scandal caused Payoneer to move to an Ireland-based bank, which has pretty onerous documentation requirements. Clearly this has upset a fair amount of vendors. I have no idea how many were impacted as a % of the total customer base but enough to warrant attention. I'm hoping this is a transitory issue but it obviously needs to be monitored. Second, the payments industry like the broadband industry is one in which if the service is not delivered seamlessly, customers will gripe to no end. (You hate your cable company but you NEED BB. You know it.) The only thing worse than BB latency is cash latency, i.e., a delay or freeze on your account. Clearly, the industry as a whole needs to do better. I can attest firsthand that vendor complaints about PayPal have reached a deafening level. However, as one disgruntled vendor notes, it's basically a two horse race. There is no third option. Assuming that's the case, I like Payoneer's position given its lower fees and better service on a relative basis than PayPal. Again, I want to see customer service scores moving in the right direction. No question. But the industry has come a long way from Western Union. Customer service. After spending some time on the r/Payoneer sub-reddit, I have two initial impressions. While the Wirecard scandal caused a headache for Payoneer’s customers, it seems to be a transitory issue. The Wirecard scandal aside, Payoneer’s customer service is less than perfect and needs to improve. (Note: few people go out of their way to praise a bank or their cable company for seamlessly delivering the services the customers pay for. Please keep that in mind when browsing r/Payoneer.) User feedback. I would very much like to thank u/-Jack-The-Lad, who provided some really great insights into his experience using Payoneer as a vendor based in Europe. Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape. A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to. Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days. Vendors can also pay suppliers directly through wire transfers and pay for services like hosting using the MasterCard. However, customers can't fund their Payoneer account. While Payoneer likes the reputation of being ""a U.S bank account"" they really are not. They are a service that allows you to receive payment from companies. While individuals can send money from and to other Payoneer accounts, wire transfers to the account can only be done by a business. As a result of the Wirecard scandal, Payoneer now gives customers the option to choose to hold their funds on their MasterCard or on Payoneer own accounts. From u/-Jack-The-Lad: “Overall I think Payoneer is a good company. They have a lot of room for expansion and their market is beyond huge. One thing I am concerned about is the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny. As Payoneer grows, it will likely get noticed by countries and may face stricter regulations both in the U.S and abroad.” Fellow customer u/tonysoleoptions notes that Payoneer offers a no frills currency exchange service while is reliable and dependable. In terms of areas for improvement he cites the slower transaction times relative to PayPal and less than optimal reporting. Industry and market opportunity: B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, “scale” and “network effects”. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they’re benefitting from these dynamics but the disclosure could have been better (more about that below). Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.) Management team and investor base: Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at MasterCard and First Data, which is exactly what you want to see. As this Barron's article notes (h/t whmcpanel), unlike with an IPO, the sponsor and institutional investors get to look at the financials before making an investment decision. This is a crucial distinction for two reasons. First, you need to choose your SPAC carefully because you're relying on the sponsor to do thorough due diligence (DD). Second, if quality institutional investors participate, it generally means they like what they saw in their DD. On both accounts, Payoneer looks promising. Betsy Cohen is an industry leader in FinTech and Payoneer's institutional investor (II) base is high quality with IIs such as Dragoneer, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Millennium, T. Rowe, and Winslow Capital Management. Wellington Management, an existing investor, also participated. These are IIs who understand FinTech and like what they saw in their DD, which is an encouraging sign.  Business model: Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years. I would say all else equal flat revenue growth vs. decelerating volume growth is a good thing but again a deeper dive into the product mix is necessary. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed. While the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn’t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I’m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins. I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition related. As for the all-important unit-economics, the customer payback period is less than 12 months, which is nice. Disclosing CLTV would have been better. The company also noted net volume retention (i.e., same store comparison of customer Y/Y volume) is over 100% but did not disclose exactly what the percentage is. This is somewhat irrelevant since anything less than 100% and the company wouldn't be getting acquired. I found the SMB cohort volume on slide 27 interesting. While it's lacking a Y-axis for volume (ugh!), it's clear each year's cohort of customers are roughly following a similar trajectory although 2015 seems to be a slight outlier. Now, if the company would just disclose the unit economics for these cohorts, you'd have your investment decision made. I think at this point, you have to trust the quality of FTOC and the II's DD. As I suggested above, my guess is that they drilled down pretty heavily and liked what they saw. Finally, many are looking at Payoneer’s transaction fees to get a sense for the potential revenue opportunity. While this is logical, it is somewhat misleading because these services are considered low quality revenue as I note above (cf. the race to sub-1% fees in China). Similar to the CDN business, where moving traffic is a commodity while providing web acceleration and cloud security offer higher margins, Payoneer needs to upsell higher value added services to its customer base, which was initially attracted by the low service fees. Once again, Payoneer highlighted these value added services in its presentation Note: the adjusted numbers were a turnoff. Covid happened. If you're benefitting from the acceleration in cross-border traffic due to the pandemic, don't exclude those sectors or markets negatively impacted by said pandemic. I believe the company was done a disservice by its bankers here in trying to manipulate the numbers. Investors aren't stupid and if they are, they're not the ones you want. This massaging of the numbers coupled with the lack of PF shares outstanding is a little concerning. It's early and the deal isn't completed yet so I'll give management the benefit of the doubt. For now. Valuation: FinTech companies such as PayPal, Square, and Payoneer are valued on subscriber growth. The key metric which the analysts will judge the company on is customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her/its lifetime. (Analysts apply a similar approach to wireless companies and data center REITs where each new subscriber or data center build is viewed on a payback and NPV basis. Technically, these companies are valued on earnings, EBITDA or AFFO but its CLTV or customer NPV which determines the valuation multiple.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter. Based on FTOC's current share price of ~$13.50, Payoneer's current market cap is roughly $6bn, which assumes ~430mn total shares outstanding.* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares.) The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels. The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's promote and the 30m shares in earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading +30% above NAV. Investment Thesis: Majority of traffic stays within the network. In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer. Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends. As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated. Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate. The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky. Playing the long game. The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for. I can tell you based on several years in the VC industry that this is their number one issue. You have the funds for payroll but they're tied up in A/R. This is where Payoneer is currently focused and I think it will represent a significant competitive advantage relative to its competition. I would love to see Payoneer partner with an institution like SVB which caters to small and emerging companies. Expect M&A to figure into the company’s strategic plans as well. Quality Sponsor and II's. As I noted above, Payoneer has a blue chip II base who performed DD not available with an IPO. These IIs clearly liked what they saw. Investors should certainly do their own DD but note that there is some impressive names in the II base, which is encouraging. Attractive valuation. Payoneer’s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and ""adjusted"" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or ""expand"" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more ""a when rather than if"" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors. Risks: Competition. PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don’t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here. Customer risk. Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo). Regulatory. Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V. Crypto currency. At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if it's just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer. FX exposure. I’m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure. TLDR: While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer’s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or “expanding” in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. I believe Payoneer will significantly reward LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their $6bn market cap vs. PayPal's +$300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business assuming the transaction past regulatory scrutiny. My advice is to spend more time digging and in the meantime acquire a small position upon which to build. ******************** Disclosure & Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor.

,"Just to be upfront, I view Payoneer as a great long-term hold. I started acquiring PayPal shares in 2016 and haven't sold since. I see some parallels with Payoneer but patience is the key. This is not really a r/SPAC play as much as its a r/investing play. (No comment on r/WSB.) While getting added to ARKF would be nice for a near-term pop, sometimes lying low to get your act together is a good thing. PayPal benefitted from the same dynamic until investors realized the company's scale was enormous. (Obviously, the eBay relationship played a huge role but the stock traded in the $80-110 range for two years before Covid drove the stock up 3x.) There will come a point when investors realize Payoneer's opportunity, but right now the opportunity is buried under mediocre financials (see below) and a frothy SPAC market for which anything less than a 50% pop at DA is a dud. It's only when you dig deeper into the potential scale benefits and where the current investments are going that you realize this may be PayPal 2.0. Hence, thee current situation is actually a great opportunity for Payoneer investors. Obviously, I would encourage everyone to do their own DD starting with the investor presentation and webcast. I personally found the presentation short on key metrics and financial detail and long on buzz words. (I guess $95mn in bankers' fees only buys so much these days.) That said, the acquisition has yet to close and Payoneer needs to be prudent. I would also add that while I avoid stereotypes, Payoneer seems to be another addition to Israel's strong lineage and tradition of building great technology companies where the MO seems to be under-promise and over-deliver. ********* Payoneer (FTOC) Summary: Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at a reasonable entry point.

The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels. The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's promote and the 30m shares in earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading +30% above NAV. Investment Thesis: Majority of traffic stays within the network. In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer. Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends. As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated. Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate. The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky. Playing the long game. The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for. I can tell you based on several years in the VC industry that this is their number one issue. You have the funds for payroll but they're tied up in A/R. This is where Payoneer is currently focused and I think it will represent a significant competitive advantage relative to its competition. I would love to see Payoneer partner with an institution like SVB which caters to small and emerging companies. Expect M&A to figure into the company’s strategic plans as well. Quality Sponsor and II's. As I noted above, Payoneer has a blue chip II base who performed DD not available with an IPO. These IIs clearly liked what they saw. Investors should certainly do their own DD but note that there is some impressive names in the II base, which is encouraging. Attractive valuation. Payoneer’s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and ""adjusted"" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or ""expand"" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more ""a when rather than if"" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors. Risks: Competition. PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don’t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here. Customer risk. Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo). Regulatory. Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V. Crypto currency. At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if it's just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer. FX exposure. I’m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure. TLDR: While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer’s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or “expanding” in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. I believe Payoneer will significantly reward LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their $6bn market cap vs. PayPal's +$300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business assuming the transaction past regulatory scrutiny. My advice is to spend more time digging and in the meantime acquire a small position upon which to build. ******************** Disclosure & Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor.
