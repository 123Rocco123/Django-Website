,"I'm an international student on an F-1 Student Visa in the US (I have an SSN), with a passport from the Republic of Macedonia. I've tried to open an account with Robinhood, and I am quitting trying after 60 e-mails exchanged with them and 3 recreated accounts haven't given me an answer as to whether or not I am able to open an account with them. Do you have any recommendations for what brokerage to use in my situation? Thanks!",Gonna be hard without a SS#. All brokerages I've worked for only do NRA with a SS#.,0,0.501,0.565,POSITIVE

Thanks!","I don't see what their problem is, unless I'm forgetting something, you should just need to fill out a W8 along with the other application info.Perhaps try a different broker like Vanguard, Schwab or Fidelity. This should be business as usual. Doesn't speak well to Robinhood if it has taken that many emails and you still dont know if they can open an account for you.Also have you tried calling them instead of email? Sometimes the people answering emails are... not the best a firm has to offer. (Nice way to put it).",0,0.53,1.0,NEGATIVE

You have to pay for market data and they have $10/mo minimum commissions. If you make a hand full of trades a month it's worth considering. If you buy and hold once or twice per month then there's probably better choices.,0,0.536,0.576,POSITIVE
