,"I’m thinking of buying a load of fractional shares of stocks and ETFs that I have some confidence will continue to rise over the years. About 150 of them. I’ll start by putting small amounts from $1-5 and occasionally $10-20 into them. I don’t plan to keep detailed track of these companies and ETFs; instead I want to just set it and forget it and hold on to them. Hopefully in a few years a lucky few will rocket and if a few plummet I’ll be OK. Is this a bad idea? A lot of people have said not to buy more than you can keep close track of. The stuff i’m considering ranges from the S&P, a total market, an international market, all the ark and xl etfs and many of the global and ishares in sectors I think will grow (clean energy, fintech, cloud, EV, jets, cars, tech, discretionary, genomics/biottch, pharma, the list goes on and on for me). Individual companies that have a track record, aapl, fb, msft, goog, visa, netflix, mastercard, goldman, starbucks, shakeshack, oracle, exxon, tesla, gm, etc,..and some that I think will grow a ton, but might not, like fnma, x and clf, and gopro lol.","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

Doing stocks and ETF’s, I imagine you’re going to have a ton of over lap and there’s absolutely no way you can keep an eye on all of them.Find a small handful you actually believe in and focus on those.",0,0.52,0.999,NEGATIVE

From semiconductors to solar, there’s something new each week. How do you narrow it down? And of course, if I cut out sectors, I will feel total FOMO.
