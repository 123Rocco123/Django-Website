,"Hey all, with US Bank announcing an upcoming credit card that offers 4% back for customers with at least $100k across their accounts, I'm considering moving my Roth IRA over from Vanguard, but would like to hear from anyone with direct experience about how it compares to the other popular choices. Is there anything I should be careful of? Anywhere that Vanguard is definitely better? Here's info on the card for those interested: https://www.usbank.com/credit-cards/bank-smartly-visa-signature-credit-card.html",Why not move only $100k to a new Roth IRA with US Bank?,0,0.586,NEGATIVE,1.0

Have you seen their UI? I never had an IRA there, but also, I worked professionally with them (consultant to them), because of one of my other clients I had to use their UI and ACH dongle and fight with them over access rights and usernames for over a decade. I would never put personal funds in that bank.",2,0.52,NEGATIVE,0.989

That's needlessly complicated.Moving my IRA from one place to another to get hundreds of dollars more per month is not needlessly complicated.The question is whether USB is a good bank to work with. I do have one of their cards and aside from one very annoying incident I've been a happy customer and don't have any issues with their UI. As a dev myself my experience is that basically every web app out there is hilariously bad if you're looking at the backend, the question is whether it works for the user.But thanks for the data point. Haven't had many people chime in either way, unfortunately.",3,0.511,NEGATIVE,0.999
