,"I'm referring to companies that facilitate mobile payments between peers and for purchases. Are there any major/upcoming players besides PayPal, WeChat, Alipay, and Apple Pay? Are these the actual companies behind these transactions or do they rely on payment processors such as Visa and MasterCard? What would the whole ""supply chain"" look like? Are there any companies that operate essential as a ""mobile bank""? I know I'm a bit ignorant on this topic, but find it very interesting so would appreciate any insight into this.",$SQ,0,0.525,0.995,NEGATIVE

Neither is a bank, but Square has pursued a banking license. Adyen (which is an interesting European payments processor) does have a banking license (https://www.adyen.com/blog/adyens-banking-license) Additionally, Adyen has been particularly successful in getting high-profile clients (Netflix, Spotify, Uber, Etsy, Microsoft, etc.)https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2016/01/20/meet-adyen-the-little-known-unicorn-collecting-cash-for-nextflix-uber-spotify-and-facebook/There's also the financial/banking fintechs - Jack Henry (JKHY), Fiserv (FISV), Temenos (TMSNY) and FIS (FIS) FIS and Fiserv have diversified into payments via buying Worldpay and First Data. First Data has the Square-like Clover, but I think Square has built out an ecosystem and made Square more of a brand than First Data has with Clover.Mastercard and Visa continue to buy up companies to compliment existing services and diversify into new ones.",0,0.522,0.947,POSITIVE

I am more interested in the ""credit card rails"" as opposed to the companies using these rails.Are Square and PayPal examples of these ""credit card rails""? Are Visa and MasterCard the companies behind mobile payment infrastructure?Adyen seems interesting, will take a look.",1,0.52,0.94,POSITIVE

As I understand it it’ll mean putting the coins in your digital wallets, what I don’t know is where the other money that you convert will be physically stored or processed, that would be valuable info.",0,0.536,0.929,NEGATIVE

I watched a video about Venmo that spoke about how much happens behind the scenes so it made me curious.,2,0.51,0.622,POSITIVE
