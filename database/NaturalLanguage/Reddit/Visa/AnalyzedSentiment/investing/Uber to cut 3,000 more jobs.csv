,"Uber is cutting 3,000 more jobs less than two weeks after an initial round of layoffs, CNBC confirmed Monday. In an email to employees Monday, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said Uber would also be shutting or consolidating 45 offices around the world and it is considering cuts to other businesses, like freight. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. “Having learned my own personal lesson about the unpredictability of the world from the punch-in-the-gut called COVID-19, I will not make any claims with absolute certainty regarding our future,” Khosrowshahi said in the email. “I will tell you, however, that we are making really, really hard choices now, so that we can say our goodbyes, have as much clarity as we can, move forward, and start to build again with confidence.” Uber’s last round of cuts on May 6 impacted 3,700 employees, which was 14% of Uber’s workforce at the time. This new round of cuts would leave Uber with about 20,000 employees, based on its latest available headcount figures. Khosrowshahi told employees in the email that Uber has “worked to provide strong severance benefits and other support for those leaving Uber, like healthcare coverage and an alumni talent directory.” It is also taking special considerations to support people on U.S. visas or parental leaves, he said.

CNBC, UBER stock price","Well, let’s stop beating around the bush.It’s one app at its core (forget Uber Eats) you need some finance folks to keep the books pretty and to engage with some credit card companies (which could be outsourced). You need a customer service department to answer questions (which could be outsourced). You need a marketing department (which could be outsourced to an agency). Your legal team, again, will be outside counsel. Hell after it was launched, you can hire back-end devs (contractors again).Uber could be a business where you have less than 100-200 full time employees and cut checks and push back on your suppliers/contractors when you feel them jacking up fees.What they’ve experienced is a huge influx of money and when they go to get funding the statement is “we need more funding to increase hiring and to expand our markets.” Repeat that several times and that’s where they are now.",1,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE

,"Uber is cutting 3,000 more jobs less than two weeks after an initial round of layoffs, CNBC confirmed Monday. In an email to employees Monday, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said Uber would also be shutting or consolidating 45 offices around the world and it is considering cuts to other businesses, like freight. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. “Having learned my own personal lesson about the unpredictability of the world from the punch-in-the-gut called COVID-19, I will not make any claims with absolute certainty regarding our future,” Khosrowshahi said in the email. “I will tell you, however, that we are making really, really hard choices now, so that we can say our goodbyes, have as much clarity as we can, move forward, and start to build again with confidence.” Uber’s last round of cuts on May 6 impacted 3,700 employees, which was 14% of Uber’s workforce at the time. This new round of cuts would leave Uber with about 20,000 employees, based on its latest available headcount figures. Khosrowshahi told employees in the email that Uber has “worked to provide strong severance benefits and other support for those leaving Uber, like healthcare coverage and an alumni talent directory.” It is also taking special considerations to support people on U.S. visas or parental leaves, he said.

,"Uber is cutting 3,000 more jobs less than two weeks after an initial round of layoffs, CNBC confirmed Monday. In an email to employees Monday, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said Uber would also be shutting or consolidating 45 offices around the world and it is considering cuts to other businesses, like freight. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. “Having learned my own personal lesson about the unpredictability of the world from the punch-in-the-gut called COVID-19, I will not make any claims with absolute certainty regarding our future,” Khosrowshahi said in the email. “I will tell you, however, that we are making really, really hard choices now, so that we can say our goodbyes, have as much clarity as we can, move forward, and start to build again with confidence.” Uber’s last round of cuts on May 6 impacted 3,700 employees, which was 14% of Uber’s workforce at the time. This new round of cuts would leave Uber with about 20,000 employees, based on its latest available headcount figures. Khosrowshahi told employees in the email that Uber has “worked to provide strong severance benefits and other support for those leaving Uber, like healthcare coverage and an alumni talent directory.” It is also taking special considerations to support people on U.S. visas or parental leaves, he said.
