,"What are your Top 3 stock picks to buy for 2019? Here are on my radar (Don't hold any yet), but will probably own 1 of these in the future: AT&T (T): Dividend >5%, P/E ratio at 11.28 (below average), and recently invested to gain streaming rights to show original movies and television series from Warner Bros., Turner and HBO. Taking into consideration the overall success Netflix, a successful launch could help charge up AT&T's share price, but this would be a slow process as competition will be fierce (Amazon Prime and Disney), and i doubt many people will be willing to have multiple streaming services accounts. Apple (AAPL): I believe apple will continue hitting new lows, the Chinese market has lost its appetite for apple cellphones, specially after Trump's Tariff and how pricey these devices have become. Long term catalyst would be the introduction of 5G network (as I am hoping for AT&T) which should get a lot of people willing to upgrade their phone, apple also has the highest retention of cellphone users (~96%), but I want to see how they plan to regain the Chinese market or if they will expand to other emerging countries like china to continue its growth. 3. Paypal (PYPL) - As more people prefer to buy online (E-Commerce), companies like Paypal, Visa and Mastercard are bound to benefit. In its last quarter, the company reported 15% increase of active accounts. It is currently trading at a higher P/E ratio than i'd prefer to buy it at, so I will be looking for significant dips in the future.

They are paying out 42% of earnings and have an amazing dividend of 1.70%~. It's obviously terribly overpriced. In 2014 they had a net income of 22$ billion. In 2017 16.5$ billion. The price of the company has gone 3x since then. If this isn't an obvious bubble I don't see what is. All of the big companies are overpriced I guess but I just can't comprehend what people see in them. 0 risk bonds give better returns than this.

You are not going to find them on CNBC weekly stock picks. You are not going to find them on stocks to watch news on Bloomberg nor in any of the analyst's advices. You need to actively look for them. What I do is take a screener and look for the following things:- P/B >1.25- Very low debt ratio- Near 2-3 year low priceThen I just start going over companies and look for ones that look interesting.Here's 2 couple interesting companies to look at: BTI, APEMY.Basically what I am looking for are companies that have lost a lot of value for no real reason. The market is extremely far from efficient.BTI is 50% down in 52 weeks for what? Earnings are stable. Debt is low. Stable growth of revenue the last 5 years. 8% yield? Hell, even if the stock itself doesn't grow that's 8% returns on investment. This is good in itself.I'll leave you to decide why I think APEMY is undervalued.",5,0.547,0.545,NEGATIVE
,"What are your Top 3 stock picks to buy for 2019? Here are on my radar (Don't hold any yet), but will probably own 1 of these in the future: AT&T (T): Dividend >5%, P/E ratio at 11.28 (below average), and recently invested to gain streaming rights to show original movies and television series from Warner Bros., Turner and HBO. Taking into consideration the overall success Netflix, a successful launch could help charge up AT&T's share price, but this would be a slow process as competition will be fierce (Amazon Prime and Disney), and i doubt many people will be willing to have multiple streaming services accounts. Apple (AAPL): I believe apple will continue hitting new lows, the Chinese market has lost its appetite for apple cellphones, specially after Trump's Tariff and how pricey these devices have become. Long term catalyst would be the introduction of 5G network (as I am hoping for AT&T) which should get a lot of people willing to upgrade their phone, apple also has the highest retention of cellphone users (~96%), but I want to see how they plan to regain the Chinese market or if they will expand to other emerging countries like china to continue its growth. 3. Paypal (PYPL) - As more people prefer to buy online (E-Commerce), companies like Paypal, Visa and Mastercard are bound to benefit.

As for Apple, everyone’s scared about China and slowing phone sales, yes it’s a small concern in the short term but it’s one that a smart investor has already taken into consideration when doing their research. Trade with China will be fixed...phone sales will go back up or even better their Apple Watch will improve and be the next bigger or biggest thing since they’re teaming up with JNJ for new health study using the watch. And it’s down 31% from its recent high because “oh noes muh phone sales”...as if Apples only capability was to make good phones.

Like when the first iPhone came out everyone HAD to have it...and for about the next 3 versions the upgrades were big...so everyone got the newest model and sales were good. Now between the 7 and X not much has changed as far as what else new it could do...was more of nicer wider flatter screens and a slightly better camera each new version... nothing ground breaking so phone sales slowed as people didn’t really feel the “need” to have the newest one while they got more expensive for minimal new features. But I think we’re due for a new big thing soon in the next few years so this is a dip and great buying opportunity for huge gains in the next 5-10 years.

Taking into consideration the overall success Netflix, a successful launch could help charge up AT&T's share price, but this would be a slow process as competition will be fierce (Amazon Prime and Disney), and i doubt many people will be willing to have multiple streaming services accounts. Apple (AAPL): I believe apple will continue hitting new lows, the Chinese market has lost its appetite for apple cellphones, specially after Trump's Tariff and how pricey these devices have become. Long term catalyst would be the introduction of 5G network (as I am hoping for AT&T) which should get a lot of people willing to upgrade their phone, apple also has the highest retention of cellphone users (~96%), but I want to see how they plan to regain the Chinese market or if they will expand to other emerging countries like china to continue its growth. 3. Paypal (PYPL) - As more people prefer to buy online (E-Commerce), companies like Paypal, Visa and Mastercard are bound to benefit.

Disney has massive IP already that people love religiously. They will be spending too, growing that out more, creating products to sell, backpacks to t-shirts, and integrating it in their parks. That’s going to be negative cash flow for another year, I’m guessing, could be longer, but wow, no one can hold a candle to it.Plus, Disney’s EP is 13!!!! Netflix 126! Now given, Disney isn’t treated as a growth stock. It’s treated as a stable stock, with a healthy dividend. But imagine a philosophical shift with investors where they see all this technological growth and begin to treat Disney speculatively, like they do Netflix.Disney, at a minimum, is as stable a home for money a single stock could provide (all stocks are risky), but it also has a growth potential unlike anything out there IMO",3,0.541,0.996,NEGATIVE

If their streaming service is successful aside from content (ease of navigation, cost relative to what the consumer gets, what Disney says will be available vs. what will actually occur) then they could use their streaming service as a greater avenue to support Marvel into their near-future move into the gaming universe.

They’re overvalued but no where near what many of its tech colleagues are valued at. You perhaps couldn’t ask for a more innovative company out there, but their problem is more getting products off the drawing board and out of the lab into consumer hands and having it be a successful, well received and popular product.

I 100% agree that the selloff that happened was warranted and justified. But overdone. The company has a shitload of cash that they can use for buybacks or several HUGE acquisitions. It is, I think, oversold now, with the $300bn loss in market cap.The iPhone is doing poorly, yes, but they still have a huge moat and people who think iPhone users (rich kids on Instagram) will migrate to Xiaomi or OnePlus or anything else, really, are wrong. Yes, they aren't buying phones every year now, but that's okay. There will be good quarters and bad quarters. What is important, is that the company knows this and they are doing things to diversify their revenue sources. They conquered the tablet market (which has become the iPad market) and the smart watch market (which has become the Apple Watch market). They're increasing their focus on services - what many people ignore is that they'll soon be unveiling a streaming service, with billions invested in original content, and likely better infrastructure than Disney will have for Disney+.I'm sure Buffett is buying now and when they announce it in February, many people will buy.The selloff that occurred would be justifiable if the stock was priced for enormous growth expectations - but the PE was quite reasonable even at ATH, even more so now (even with low earnings estimates).

I think the slimmer company they're aiming to create will bring in better cash flows that aren't going to be eaten away by high debt levels. Strong brand name recognition (Mr.Coffee, Yankee Candle, Sharpie, etc.) and their increasing net income makes me hopeful for their future. That Carl Icahn is heavily invested in the company also doesn't hurt either (he knows what he's doing and knows how to squeeze value out of a company). I'd like to see them cut their stock buyback amounts in half and really focus on cutting their debt down to well below a moderately acceptable amount. I've been a shareholder for a while now.TRN (no positions yet but keeping my eye on it, I have a price point of $15, most I'll pay is $17).-Trinity Industries. Railcar manufacturing and railcar leasing operations are why I like this company. The expected CAGR of the railroad industry by 2023 is $829 billion. The American railroad industry is going nowhere and I believe will continue to be the first place companies will go to ship bulk items. America is also ramping up petroleum production in a big way and oil is primarily shipped through the rail systems (I work in air cargo and shipping oil is too expensive and rather impractical, trucks only make sense for short, relatively speaking, distances). They got hit hard by the import taxes (tariffs) and their declining construction segments due to the severe worker shortage in that industry is doing them no favors. They're sitting on low debt and I'll continue to keep a close eye on them in the near future. They currently are one of the largest companies (per market share) to have railcar leasing operations. The others are Wells Fargo Rail, Citix, and Union Tank Car. This company is one of my favorites and if I have it calculated right then I'll be jumping in if and when they dip to $15. They've floated around $19 before and I think they're a company primed to take advantage of a growing and solid industry.",0,0.548,1.0,POSITIVE

,"What are your Top 3 stock picks to buy for 2019? Here are on my radar (Don't hold any yet), but will probably own 1 of these in the future: AT&T (T): Dividend >5%, P/E ratio at 11.28 (below average), and recently invested to gain streaming rights to show original movies and television series from Warner Bros., Turner and HBO. Taking into consideration the overall success Netflix, a successful launch could help charge up AT&T's share price, but this would be a slow process as competition will be fierce (Amazon Prime and Disney), and i doubt many people will be willing to have multiple streaming services accounts. Apple (AAPL): I believe apple will continue hitting new lows, the Chinese market has lost its appetite for apple cellphones, specially after Trump's Tariff and how pricey these devices have become. Long term catalyst would be the introduction of 5G network (as I am hoping for AT&T) which should get a lot of people willing to upgrade their phone, apple also has the highest retention of cellphone users (~96%), but I want to see how they plan to regain the Chinese market or if they will expand to other emerging countries like china to continue its growth. 3. Paypal (PYPL) - As more people prefer to buy online (E-Commerce), companies like Paypal, Visa and Mastercard are bound to benefit. In its last quarter, the company reported 15% increase of active accounts. It is currently trading at a higher P/E ratio than i'd prefer to buy it at, so I will be looking for significant dips in the future. Please note that this is just my opinion, and wanted to share it to get your feedback and hopefully read what stocks you are planning to buy and why.",Venmo is owned by PayPal,2,0.513,0.999,NEGATIVE
