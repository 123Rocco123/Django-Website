I would definitely not have 50% in one thing and with Visa and Mastercard you're betting on very similar companies as the other half of your portfolio. I've occasionally owned Mastercard over the years but have primarily focused on Visa. So you have half of your portfolio in Microsoft and the other half is two companies that are similar enough that the other half of your portfolio is going to largely move together.All three great companies, but I think this could be 30-40% of your portfolio, not 100% of it.",0,0.515,1.0,NEGATIVE

The first step is the toughest.Assuming you won’t need to use the money you’ve chosen to invest for at least 10 years, I agree with other posters that some diversification would be a good next step. However, I disagree with those saying you should sell either Visa or MasterCard. Just start the diversification process with your next purchases. In my experience so far, four of the five biggest mistakes I’ve made were selling too early. Now I’m a buy and hold guy.As one commenter mentioned, a broad-scope ETF provides immediate and easy diversification. As I’m sure you’re aware if you’ve poked around this sub, Vanguard is great.Good luck and happy trading!",0,0.522,0.998,POSITIVE

Young person investing for short term in three stocks and two are the two biggest credit card companies.

Given you don't have a lot to invest at the moment, I'd personally recommend you invest in a broader market index that way your diversified across different sectors, at least. I understand wanting to pick individual stocks, but you're not going to achieve a diversified portfolio with $2500. Just realize you're hitching your [wagon] to these horses specifically, and be prepared to deal with the extra volatility.Second thought, you've picked fairly expensive companies. They're expensive because the market as a whole expects growth, so it's already priced in. I'm working off old data, but Microsoft was priced for something like 35% forward growth, which is a lot IMO. If they hit that rate, you don't really make much. If growth forecasts slow for whatever reason, you're going to take a hit, even if they're still growing and profitable. They need that growth to justify the current stock price. Once again, your call on if you think that growth rate is realistic.",0,0.542,0.996,NEGATIVE

Forward P/E is key to me.Visa high valuation doesn't justify that much growth. PEG tells me that it isn't growing fast.So when facing this situation, I usually see two outcomes:Bull market on Visa reverses because at the end it is all about the earnings and the rate of growth. Coming from such a high valuation means often a larger dip to the mean.Visa continues on the bull ramp up, so I speculate on 1), meaning I know i am paying too much and I am hoping other people will pay as much as I did so the stocks goes higher... this to me isn't investing, it is gambling.",2,0.53,1.0,NEGATIVE
