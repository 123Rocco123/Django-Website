,Personally I’m ~3% .. visa + amzn take up a pretty sigificant portion so that kinda drags average yield way down .. currently looking to add a few other higher div stocks if anyone has any suggestions feel free ..,"Look at REITs. Many have been beat up from the concerns of raising rates but REITs are some of the best stocks to own if you’re looking for dividends. The important thing is to look at the type of company or REIT fund. I’d personally stay away from or at least limit exposure to REITs involving things like shopping malls, movie theaters, and restaurants. I like ones involving office buildings, unique and favorable renting terms, cell phone towers, etc.The largest REIT holding I currently have is in a company called STOR Capital (STOR). It’s been on a decent run the last few weeks after a tough end to 2017. They focus mostly on office buildings and have some interesting leasing terms where the tenant is responsible for most of the upkeep and expenses of the building and they try to lease to only successful businesses that are expected to be around for a long time. They also have some great occupancy rates. It’s also owned by Buffett for what’s it worth. They do have some exposure to a few of the things I don’t like however but it’s tough finding REIT companies that don’t.",0,0.536,0.844,POSITIVE
