,"I'm in US with a Work Visa, and there's a possibility we may move to Canada because it has lesser work-related restrictions for my wife & we can get a PR. I need to start investing in Index Fund/Mutual Fund (haven't started yet) for next 20-30 years long term. Does Canadian Stock Market grow as well as USA? Is it worth to invest in US from Canada with all the currency difference, Wiring Charges & Taxation? Need some advice here please :)","The Canadian stock market sucks. So many of the major industries have terrible idiosyncrasies.30% is banking, the profitability of which are tied to our unsustainable real estate situation.Telecoms are another huge sector, which would be destroyed if they ever opened up the market to US competition, as our telecoms fleece us at a global scale.Then you have fossil fuels, mining companies, forestry.. all sorts of things that are vulnerable to increasing regulation.And that's the vast majority of our stock market covered.Much better to buy the US market with its diversity of industries and global all-stars. When i started investing in 2015 I did like 75/25 US/Canada, which became 100% US within a couple of years. The Canadian index I sold is still somewhere around what I sold it for.",0,0.549,1.0,NEGATIVE
