,"Hey, so I've been researching purchasing t-bills (maybe the 3- and 4-month though not sure yet) and was going to take a stab at it later this month. In researching, I wanted to try purchasing through my Fidelity account (rather than through Treasury Direct) as the Fidelity interface seemed more straightforward and because I'm also worried about the processing time for this FS-5511 form that it's my understanding you have to complete and wait at least several weeks to get processed if you go through Treasury Direct before cashing out the T-Bill funds. So the first issue I have is that, while I've had a Fidelity account for years, my only account there is a 529 account that I don't fund at all and only keep open because of a ""529 Visa Signature"" credit card that I have linked to it and only maintain to to get the 2% credit card rewards that come from that. To fund the t-bills, I'm wanting to transfer $$$ from my external (SoFi) savings account to Fidelity and then look to set up a t-bill purchase as soon as those funds are available within Fidelity. But I suppose I'm not clear on the most efficient way to link an external account in a way to immediately purchase t-bills through Fidelity? So for example, say I wanted to use $50K from my external SoFi account to buy t-bills on Fidelity... I see where you would go on Fidelity to puchase the t-bills, but I'm unclear on how to link my SoFi account in a way that I can purchase the t-bills through the linked account. Any assistance is appreciated and apologies if my explanation isn't clear, thanks!","You can often get higher returns on the secondary market at Fidelity. Unlike the auction route, you can sell anytime you want with a few clicks which can come in handy. And, let’s say the 28 day auction rate is 5.39% APY, you can sometimes get higher rates on the secondary market. Remember, people selling before maturity on the secondary market sometimes offer a higher rate (I’ve gotten as high as 6.1%) because they need their money fast. Also, keep in mind this is interest via discount. So if you pay $9 for a $10’face value (to keep the math simple), you aren’t making $1 on $10, you are making $1 on $9. 11% vs 10%. And factor in that the TBill returns are state tax exempt which gives you a bit of a kicker. Good Luck!",0,0.528,POSITIVE,0.664

During that process they’ll ask how you want to fund it, at which point you should be able to link your external bank account and select how much you want to move over. Then once the funds are available for trading in your new brokerage account, you buy your T-bills either according to the new issue auction schedule, or on the secondary market.",0,0.548,POSITIVE,0.569

Add a taxable brokerage or IRA account and setup an EFT link to your funding account. You setup the EFT link at Fidelity. It may take several days to the link to become active.Treasury Direct does transfers from external accounts for purchases, brokers do not. You will have request a transfer from your bank to the broker. You do that at the broker. The money goes to your settlement fund at the broker and sits there until you do something with it. The standard settlement fund at Fidelity is the SPAXX money market fund - currently paying ~5%.On a new account at Fidelity with a new EFT link they may put a risk hold on the transferred funds. IIRC, it was about two weeks. During that time you can't do anything with the money. Once the account has some history they reduce or eliminate the hold. The EFT can take a day to a week to transfer and settle before being able to use it.Treasury bond auctions are done on a schedule. You have between the auction announcement date and the auction date to place an order to buy. At other times the bonds will not be listed as available to buy. For example, 17 week T-Bills are announced on Tuesday and the auction is on Wednesday. You have a window of about 18 hours between Monday and Tuesday to place an order. Other bond durations have different timing between announcement and auction dates.This is the auction schedule:https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/221/Tentative-Auction-Schedule.pdfBonds are sold at $1000 par value minimum and $1000 increments.Fidelity allows auto purchase of new bonds from matured bonds.The money to purchase the bond(s) is pulled from your settlement fund on the settlement date a few days to a week after the auction. That is when you own the bond and interest starts accruing.You can see the results of the auction on the auction day here:https://www.treasurydirect.gov/auctions/announcements-data-results/announcement-results-press-releases/auction-results/",0,0.528,NEGATIVE,0.997

To do that:Create a brokerage account. If you go to Accounts & Trade -> Portfolio, ""Open an account"" is an option on the left side. Brokerage account will be one of the options on the next page.Set up EFT to/from your savings account. To do that, go to your Portfolio, then click on the $ Transfer in the upper left (below Accounts & Trade). Pick ""EFT to or from a bank"".

From there the instructions will guide you on what you need to do (it may take a while).After your bank account is linked, you'll be able to go to that $ Transfer button and pick it from the ""transfer from"" list.
