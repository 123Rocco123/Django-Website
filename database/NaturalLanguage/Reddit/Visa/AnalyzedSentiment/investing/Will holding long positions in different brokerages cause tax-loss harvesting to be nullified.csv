,"Quick question that I couldn't find a specific answer for: If I have a taxable investment account with a robo-advisor like Wealthfront with >$100k, Wealthfront will purchase the individual stocks instead of the related ETF's if stock-level tax-loss harvesting is activated. Let's say my WF account buys 5 shares of Visa. If I have a brokerage account somewhere else like M1 that also owns shares of Visa, and WF sells the Visa shares in order to take advantage of the loss, but I still have the long position in Visa on M1, will the IRS treat this somehow as a wash/loop-hole, or will the taxable loss be realized?","Why would holding a stock create a wash? I think so long as you don’t buy it 30 days before or after the sale, it can be considered a tax loss. This is to prevent you from just buying back the position immediately after (or before) the sale.",0,0.552,0.993,NEGATIVE

I remember reading some article about tax-loss harvesting that said if you have too many brokerage accounts holding similar/same positions, the IRS will simply just not allow the loss to be realized. Of course, in hindsight, I'm not sure how accurate that sounds, but since I'm going to start holding a much larger portion (to me) in investments, I wanted to be as confident & safe as possible!",1,0.55,0.682,POSITIVE

That lists losses and gains and is the result of entering each stock and each transaction. So if you are using several taxable brokerage accounts you are setting yourself or your accountant up for a lot of paperwork. But the compiled results are what gets entered. Say you have 4 buys and sells on FB in one account and 5 buys and sells on FB in another account. If they all have different holding periods you have 9 entries in your spreadsheet. If they all have the same buy and sell dates and hence holding periods you have one combined entry in your ss. If you sell in one account and buy again in the other account within 30 days you have a wash sale.,0,0.523,0.957,NEGATIVE
