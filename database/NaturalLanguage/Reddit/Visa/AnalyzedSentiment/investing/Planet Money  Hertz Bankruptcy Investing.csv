,"So I was catching up on my podcasts while waiting to renew my visa. I enjoy some of the interesting stories the Planet Money team investigates. I noticed they did a story on Hertz last Thursday. I didn’t think much of their initial interview, which was a woman who claims to work for the Department of Defense. She is an “IT Tech”, but has a hobby of trading stocks on an app named Robinhood. Cue collective eyeroll She spoke to the possible ROI if she bought $100 worth of Hertz. She then, instead, decided to drop $2,000 post bankruptcy filing. Fast forward to the end, she sold for a 10k profit. I wonder if podcasting trades such as these will continue to draw in under-informed and clueless investors trying to strike it big on dangerously lucky trades. But even more dangerously, giving them access to things like options trading through Robinhood. Thoughts? Mid post update: Soneone from my hometown (poor rural Minnesota town) posted that they lost their savings in the market recently using Robinhood. (https://www.npr.org/2020/06/24/883047437/owner-of-a-broken-hertz)",I wonder if podcasting trades such as these will continue to draw in under-informed and clueless investors trying to strike it big on dangerously lucky trades.They did a good job explaining it was a risky dumb trade and the stock is going to zero .,0,0.53,1.0,NEGATIVE
