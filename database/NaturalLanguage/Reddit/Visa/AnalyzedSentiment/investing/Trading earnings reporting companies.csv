,"Hey there guys, I would like to here your opinions on the below strategy, as i am fairly new to investing and trading, as a whole. Ive been thinking into putting some money into a few stocks, before their earnings come up, with the hope that the price will pump up a bit, before that. After a short research i shortened the list to: Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) The Blackstone Group Inc. (BX) Visa Inc. (V) Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH) AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) Humana Inc. (HUM) I have also thought about buying into Netflix and Amazon, but since they are at all time highs and there's not much time left till their earnings i doubt that there is any profit to be made there.","You used the word hope, which was accurate.Hope is not a strategy, however.",0,0.519,0.985,NEGATIVE
