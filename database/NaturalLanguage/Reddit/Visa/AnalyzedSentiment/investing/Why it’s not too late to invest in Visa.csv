,"Looking at VISA’s Investor relation page, and recent fillings, I believe there is still plenty of time to get in on Visa’s growth opportunity. A quick look: Visa is at the center of more than half of the world's credit card transactions. Founded in 1958 (as BankAmericard) Visa cards are used over 40 million times every day. And the Visa brand is one of the most recognized on the planet. But what do they do? There are 3 key ways VISA makes money: 1. Service Fees: Visa charges banks on their network a small percentage every time the customer of the bank makes a transaction (basically a commission), this fee is typically around $.07, plus 0.11% so the more a product costs, the more money Visa makes. This is particularly interesting, as it’s a built-in hedge against inflation. In 2018, Visa’s services revenue was $8.9 billion on $8.1 trillion of network spend. 2. Data Processing Fees: Visa also earns a fee for settling transactions between banks, these fees are based on the total number of transactions made on Visa’s network, regardless of the dollar amount. So, it costs Visa the same to process one million transactions as it does 10 million. In 2018, Visa’s data processing revenue was $9 billion, on 124 billion transactions, or $.07 per transaction. 3. Cross Border Fees: Visa charges fees for processing cross-border transactions, these transactions are typically harder/ more complex to process meaning the fees are much higher than normal transactions. In 2018, Visa’s cross-border revenue was $7.2b with an estimated yield of 1%, making it Visa’s most profitable product. Other interesting stats: 65% Operating Margin $49 billion has been paid to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends since 2010 There is still a lot of work to do: Move to a cashless society: 71% of payment volume in the US is Card & Electronic, meaning there is 29% to still eat into. By Visa’s estimate, $17 trillion is still spent on cash and check each year. And this is just the U.S there are plenty of completely unbanked countries. E-Commerce: Its obvious E-Commerce is growing at an enormous rate, which is great for Visa! They estimate that they earn $0.43 of every dollar spent online vs. %0.15 for physical transactions, (because you can’t use cash online) so the more that moves online, the better it is for VISA. B2B: Visa has always been a business to consumer company, but they’re currently exploring B2B segment with products like Visa Connect.

And the Visa brand is one of the most recognized on the planet. But what do they do? There are 3 key ways VISA makes money: 1. Service Fees: Visa charges banks on their network a small percentage every time the customer of the bank makes a transaction (basically a commission), this fee is typically around $.07, plus 0.11% so the more a product costs, the more money Visa makes. This is particularly interesting, as it’s a built-in hedge against inflation. In 2018, Visa’s services revenue was $8.9 billion on $8.1 trillion of network spend. 2. Data Processing Fees: Visa also earns a fee for settling transactions between banks, these fees are based on the total number of transactions made on Visa’s network, regardless of the dollar amount. So, it costs Visa the same to process one million transactions as it does 10 million. In 2018, Visa’s data processing revenue was $9 billion, on 124 billion transactions, or $.07 per transaction. 3. Cross Border Fees: Visa charges fees for processing cross-border transactions, these transactions are typically harder/ more complex to process meaning the fees are much higher than normal transactions. In 2018, Visa’s cross-border revenue was $7.2b with an estimated yield of 1%, making it Visa’s most profitable product.

I'm not buying your assertion that millennials are less likely to use credit. The way I see it, with all of the resources and information at our disposal we're able to utilize credit more efficiently and to our benefit.Also, for most mobile wallet type apps, you connect your credit (or debit) card directly to the app and utilize it that way. I'm not seeing why apps like Apple Pay/Google Pay would decrease credit card use, you literally connect your card to the app. It doesn't matter if your carrying the physical card.",1,0.531,0.974,NEGATIVE

And the Visa brand is one of the most recognized on the planet. But what do they do? There are 3 key ways VISA makes money: 1. Service Fees: Visa charges banks on their network a small percentage every time the customer of the bank makes a transaction (basically a commission), this fee is typically around $.07, plus 0.11% so the more a product costs, the more money Visa makes. This is particularly interesting, as it’s a built-in hedge against inflation. In 2018, Visa’s services revenue was $8.9 billion on $8.1 trillion of network spend. 2. Data Processing Fees: Visa also earns a fee for settling transactions between banks, these fees are based on the total number of transactions made on Visa’s network, regardless of the dollar amount. So, it costs Visa the same to process one million transactions as it does 10 million. In 2018, Visa’s data processing revenue was $9 billion, on 124 billion transactions, or $.07 per transaction. 3. Cross Border Fees: Visa charges fees for processing cross-border transactions, these transactions are typically harder/ more complex to process meaning the fees are much higher than normal transactions. In 2018, Visa’s cross-border revenue was $7.2b with an estimated yield of 1%, making it Visa’s most profitable product.

Data Processing Fees: Visa also earns a fee for settling transactions between banks, these fees are based on the total number of transactions made on Visa’s network, regardless of the dollar amount. So, it costs Visa the same to process one million transactions as it does 10 million. In 2018, Visa’s data processing revenue was $9 billion, on 124 billion transactions, or $.07 per transaction. 3. Cross Border Fees: Visa charges fees for processing cross-border transactions, these transactions are typically harder/ more complex to process meaning the fees are much higher than normal transactions. In 2018, Visa’s cross-border revenue was $7.2b with an estimated yield of 1%, making it Visa’s most profitable product. Other interesting stats: 65% Operating Margin $49 billion has been paid to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends since 2010 There is still a lot of work to do: Move to a cashless society: 71% of payment volume in the US is Card & Electronic, meaning there is 29% to still eat into. By Visa’s estimate, $17 trillion is still spent on cash and check each year. And this is just the U.S there are plenty of completely unbanked countries. E-Commerce: Its obvious E-Commerce is growing at an enormous rate, which is great for Visa! They estimate that they earn $0.43 of every dollar spent online vs. %0.15 for physical transactions, (because you can’t use cash online) so the more that moves online, the better it is for VISA. B2B: Visa has always been a business to consumer company, but they’re currently exploring B2B segment with products like Visa Connect. Acquisition of Visa Europe To sum everything up, I think Visa is a sure bet on global economic expansion. What do you guys think?","Visa's moat is that they've already invested in the required security & fraud protection infrastructure. These costs are so prohibitive that every digital payment service teams up with either V or MA, effectively forcing the competition to include at least one of the two (or both, in the case of Libra) as charter members. It seems extremely unlikely that either of these companies will face steep competition from the inside. Besides, V and MA have long realized that competition is not a bad thing as long as it feeds the overall tide of transition from cash/cheque to digital.As for crypto, who the fuck knows. In its current form it's inarguably not a legitimate currency and there's not nearly enough information on FedNow out there to know if this even is a threat or an opportunity for V. It's not out of reason that enterprises like V will handle the transactions on this kind of system which would make this an opportunity rather than a threat.",1,0.517,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Looking at VISA’s Investor relation page, and recent fillings, I believe there is still plenty of time to get in on Visa’s growth opportunity.

And the Visa brand is one of the most recognized on the planet. But what do they do? There are 3 key ways VISA makes money: 1. Service Fees: Visa charges banks on their network a small percentage every time the customer of the bank makes a transaction (basically a commission), this fee is typically around $.07, plus 0.11% so the more a product costs, the more money Visa makes.
