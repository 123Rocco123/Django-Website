,"Hey I’m a Canadian Citizen and worked temporarily in the US for 4-5 months on a TN visa. As such, I received a SSN number which allows me to open up most financial accounts in the US. I moved back to Canada but still have funds in my US bank account (bank of America). I was thinking, rather than pay US-CAD conversion fees, I’d rather just open up a US trading account and trade in the USD that I earned. Can I open up a tax free retirement account (Roth IRA), and subsequently will I have to pay any additional taxes given that I’m residing in Canada? Also, how can I check how much room I have for contributions for a Roth IRA? I’m used to a TFSA here in Canada. Thanks","Can’t answer your question, but I presume you got a SSN (social security number), when you were in the US. SIN is your Canadian equivalent.",0,0.512,NEGATIVE,0.997

Thanks","This is what I got from AI: “ You are correct that a Roth IRA is a tax-free account, meaning that the earnings and withdrawals are not subject to U.S. federal income tax. However, there are still some tax implications to consider:Canadian taxes: As a Canadian resident, you will be subject to Canadian taxes on your worldwide income, including any income earned from a Roth IRA account. Canada does not recognize the tax-free status of a Roth IRA, so you may be subject to Canadian taxes on the earnings and withdrawals from the account.Reporting requirements: You will need to report the existence of the Roth IRA account on your Canadian tax return, using Form T1135, ""Foreign Income Verification Statement"". You may also need to report any income earned from the account on your Canadian tax return.U.S.-Canada Tax Treaty: The U.S.-Canada Tax Treaty may impact the taxation of your Roth IRA account. Article XXI of the treaty exempts U.S. social security benefits (including Roth IRA distributions) from Canadian tax, but this exemption may not apply to investment income earned within the account.Withholding taxes: If you earn interest or dividends from U.S. sources within the Roth IRA account, you may be subject to U.S. withholding taxes. These taxes can be recovered by claiming a foreign tax credit on your Canadian tax return.FATCA reporting: As a Canadian resident with a U.S. financial account (including a Roth IRA), you may be subject to reporting requirements under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). You will need to report your account information to the U.S. Department of the Treasury or the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).It's essential to consult with a tax professional or financial advisor who is familiar with both U.S. and Canadian tax laws to ensure you comply with all reporting requirements and minimize any tax implications.”Can someone confirm or go into detail regarding tax implications? Is this worth getting an accountant for?",0,0.515,NEGATIVE,0.951

Thanks","Considering US citizens need to have earned taxable income to contribute to a Roth IRA, I would assume you need to have earned taxable income in the US to contribute to a Roth IRA.So unless you're paying taxes to the US on your income, I don't think you would qualify to make contributions to your Roth IRA.",0,0.516,NEGATIVE,0.999

Thanks","This is almost definitely going to be more trouble than it's worth, and I would talk to a CPA, familiar with cross-border tax advice, before taking any action.Assuming you're currently a Canadian tax resident, you cannot open a Roth IRA, and if you have one open, any contributions would cause the Roth IRA to loose its tax-exempt status. Depending on how you're holding the securities you purchase, you will also be hit with foreign withholding tax. If I were you, I would just transfer the US bank account balance into a brokerage account as USD or a US dollar-Canadian bank account.",0,0.521,NEGATIVE,1.0
