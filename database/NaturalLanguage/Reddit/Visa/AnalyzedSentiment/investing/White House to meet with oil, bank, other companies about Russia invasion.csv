Once gas prices are lower, it will be back to the green agenda, trying to make it as difficult as possible for ""traditional"" energy companies and the management teams at those companies are smart enough to know it.It seems ridiculous to me that the administration is trying to figure out ways to buy more oil from Venezuela and Iran but still insists on making life as difficult as possible for U.S. and Canadian companies.",0,0.515,0.998,NEGATIVE
