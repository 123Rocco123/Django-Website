,"I see a common strategy that many tend to employ is to pick an index like the s&p and then pick some of the stocks in the top 10 of the index that they think are good companies.

That is the major detriment to mutual fund performance on the manager's side. I'd like to see how well fund managers do when that factor is taken into account, and also filtering out funds that don't have a significant investment of the managers themselves.As for large funds closing to investors that's kind of an expected thing.
