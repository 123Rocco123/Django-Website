,"I am wanting to invest my (fairly large) tax return into something long-term. 44 years old and waiting until retirement (or longer) without touching it. Also, I would be contributing relatively regularly to this from here on out. I have both a Vanguard and two Schwab accounts already (all in Apple/visa/Microsoft/Brkb/walmart/SCHB/Mcd’s/UNH) and would like everyone’s opinion on mutual funds/ETFs to put the money into whether it’s one that I listed or not.","VTI and VOO have fairly the same performance. Out of the two, I’d suggest VOO. Vanguard ETFs are a great way to invest in retirement funds.",0,0.516,0.824,NEGATIVE

That’s the way I want to go but I have 100% exposure to stocks and I’m not sure if that’s the right approach at my age.,1,0.518,0.885,NEGATIVE

VTI is more diversified than VOO. You are not old, so the bond mixture would depend on your life style. Don’t smoke and go to the gym than VTI > VFORX.",0,0.51,0.857,NEGATIVE

I was thinking that VTI was the way to go but I’m just worried about the exposure of holding 100% stocks to a correction in the near future. But you’re right. I have 20-40 years to weather any dips in the market.,1,0.53,0.999,POSITIVE

Not familiar with Vanguard SP 500 tickers, btw. I would not hold any of the companies you posted in the OP , especially Walmart and Apple. I'm young with roughly 4 decades before retirement (just like you) and my sole Roth IRA holding is Google and general account holds Redfin and Prologis.",0,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE
