,"I'm a long term investor. Usually, once I bought, I don't sell them if their business continue to be prospect. Previously, when I make investment decision, I place heavy emphasize on Company brand Product moat Dividend paid Hence, stocks like KO, PG are under my portfolio. However, over-the-time, I don't think that's is a good strategy. Too conservative and the Annualized yield is low. I decide to adjust my investment style by placing heavy emphasize on Company brand Product moat Earning growth Right now, here's my portfolio MCD BABA GOOGL DIS FB BP SAN Due to the poor earning growth for BP and SAN, I plan to sold them away, once I get their dividend paid. I plan to purchase 2 different stocks, to add into my portfolio. There are some stocks under my consideration. ZTS - As, I feel as time-goes-on, human are in fact more dependent on animal (cat, dog, cow, ...). Hence, medicine for animal seem like a product with good prospect. Also, over past few year, ZTS seem to have a good price chart run. ISRG - Robotic surgery seem like a product with huge moat. VISA - Branded financial company with proven historical record. MA - Branded financial company with proven historical record. DPZ - Pizza company with a good price chart run over the past few year. Not sure I'm late to party for this. If you were me, which will you pick, and why?","Why do you focus more on broad aspects such as brand and product most, as opposed to actual fundamental analysis. Credit ratios, growth ratios, DuPont analysis etc.SNAP has a wonderful brand. Garbage stock TWTR is another solid brand. Garbage stockYou should definitely still incorporate things like that into your analysis, but I think using that chiefly for a top-down approach isn’t very effective.That being said ISRG is a wonderful company I’ve know about for three years now, but I think that boat has sailed. Very expensive",0,0.555,0.999,NEGATIVE
