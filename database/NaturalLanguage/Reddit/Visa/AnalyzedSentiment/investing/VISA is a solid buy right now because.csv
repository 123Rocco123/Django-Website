,"Hello! I've been reading up on investing and have seen the advice again and again that there are always deals to be found regardless of how the market looks. The problem for an amateur like me, of course, is identifying those deals. VISA is a stock that I have added to my long-term buy and hold wishlist (I did so back in March when it was at $153), but I am not sure how to evaluate at what price it is a good deal. Any suggestions, especially in terms of resources you use to make these kinds of informed decisions, would be much appreciated! I have read Buffet uses Value Line, although I wonder whether such an expensive platform is worth it for a small time would-be long term value investor like myself... Any experiences with this service (which has a lot of differently priced packages choose from!) and others would also be appreciated.",There's never been a bad time to buy V. Even right before the GFC was a good time. Wasn't the best time though.,0,0.546,0.75,NEGATIVE

It's a very tough one to value, harder than Amazon IMO. Visa always looks overvalued yet keeps going up and up. They either have some really weird accounting that I can't figure out (I'm a CPA, lol) or the market is assigning a very low discount rate for a reason I'm unaware of. Best of luck with it, she's a doozy.",2,0.54,0.999,NEGATIVE

I wasn't aware that some stocks are more difficult to value than others. I assumed that this might be the case to a degree, but your comment puts things in perspective more. What about Home Depot for example? It's a favorite among the dividend stocks. But how do you say that it is currently at a price you should jump on if you are planning on holding long term?",3,0.523,0.999,POSITIVE

As for HD, I can't help you there as I've never really looked at it, sorry.
