,"Some stocks are really undervalued like Xerox, Big Lots, BJs restaurants, Aflac, brkb, crox, genworth financial, gnc, the gap, hanes brands, etc. Some of these stocks have p/es and prices under 5 which is rediculous. However, a lot of these weren't good names for instance the only really good stocks of the companies above are Brk and maybe aflac. However, with the market the way it is would it be better to buy companies that are almost at 0, or to still focus on good names that may still be slightly overvalued but have come down a lot. For example, Microsoft, Apple, Netflix, Lululemon, Adobe, cloud stocks etc. A lot of these still have rediculous P/E ratios and high prices compared to the stocks listed in the undervalued group, but even these stocks have come down greatly almost 40% or so in past month. So would investing in companies in the first group like Big Lots that were underperformers even before the coronavirus, but are now extremely cheap P.E. around 3 to 10, or would the second group of companies ex: Visa/Apple that had higher growth rates before coronavirus but have dropped to P.E.s that are around 20 to 40 be better?
