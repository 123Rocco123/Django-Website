,"Started investing this year, the objective is half index ETF and the other Half stock picks to hold >10 years (mostly for fun, as I really enjoyed learning about value investing). As I am still a rookie in investing I would love some feedback My method is looking at companies that meet most of the following criteria: gross margin >40%, 5Y ROIC>15%, 5Y ROCE >20%, insider ownership >10%, Capex/sales <5%, net margin >10%, FCF margin >10%, Revenue growth >8%, earnings growth >7%, stock based compensation preferably <10% of operating cash flow. I look for businesses I can understand and I perceive to have a strong moat. Then I perform a discount cash flow analysis using a discount rate of 15% and an exit free cash flow multiple. I prefer companies with at least 5 year history of free cash flow growth to calculate the expected cash flow growth.

The US companies are large weights in the index, so you’re just doubling up. Maybe make the index a small cap index, rather than large cap? I’m assuming it’s S&P 500. The inside ownership % criteria is too onerous in my opinion. Good luck! I really admire your disciplined approach.",0,0.522,0.923,POSITIVE

The index is the FTSE All World index. I could make the etf portion of the portfolio 80% FTSE all world and 20% small cap. Any ETF you recomend?,1,0.521,0.554,POSITIVE

I think ETFs though are appropriate for the vast majority of people and situations. I’m glad you’ve got some international exposure, and yeah I think if you have the luxury of investing for decades, few things will do better than small caps, so I’d have material exposure there through a very low cost index fund or etf. I can’t recommend one versus another: ignorance.",0,0.52,1.0,NEGATIVE
