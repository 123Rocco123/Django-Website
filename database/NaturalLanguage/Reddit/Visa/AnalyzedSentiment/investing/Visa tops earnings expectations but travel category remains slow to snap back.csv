,"Visa Inc. topped fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue expectations Tuesday but the company saw volume declines as the COVID-19 crisis continued to crimp spending growth, notably in the travel category. Shares V, -0.08% were off 1% in after-hours trading. The company posted net income of $2.4 billion, or $1.07 a share, down from $3.1 billion, or $1.37 a share, in the year-prior quarter. Adjusted earnings came in at $1.06 a share, whereas analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting $1.03 a share. Visa’s revenue fell to $4.84 billion from $5.84 billion, while the FactSet consensus called for $4.82 billion. Payment volume dropped 10% for the quarter, while cross-border volume was off 37%. Excluding intra-Europe transactions, cross-border volume fell 47%. The company said in its earnings release that it saw spending improve in each month of the fiscal third quarter as more countries began easing coronavirus-related restrictions on economic activity. Payments volume “meaningfully improved” in the U.S. as the quarter wore on, giving a boost to card-present spending as e-commerce spending “remained consistently elevated,” backing out travel-related spending. Processed transactions dropped 13% in the quarter on a global basis. Visa said that this metric has lagged volume growth “as the mix of spending shifted away from smaller transactions.” Cross-border volume “has improved only marginally through the quarter” given continued restrictions on travel, a key source of this sort of spending activity. Management isn’t providing an outlook for the full fiscal year given the uncertainties around COVID-19. Marketwatch, VISA Earnings Release from their IR page","I think this is pretty good news for Visa to be honest.@ 1.07 EPS, puts Visa at ~4.28 annualized EPS... so PE lower than 50. And that was potentially their worst quarter. They already said they saw recovery in the later portion of the quarter.Think this is a bargain price for what they stand to earn 1 year from now",0,0.568,1.0,NEGATIVE

Marketwatch, VISA Earnings Release from their IR page","I’ll throw in Discover into your question since Discover and American Express have almost identical business models.I view AXP to be more similar to ALLY than to V. AXP is involved in online banking, loans (which you do not want to be in right now), as well as payment processing. AXP isn’t attractive to me because I view every other segment of AXP besides their credit card side to be a negative. It’s not an attractive growth engine to me. (Replace AXP with discover wherever you want. Essentially the same argument)The only difference between Discover and AXP is that AXP credit cards tend to cater towards higher net worth individuals who should be more economically shielded from this pandemic, but even then, it’s not a place I want to put my money.In general, I try to avoid putting my money into companies that have so many moving parts because rarely can a company execute correctly in five different directions.PM me if you want to discuss more.",4,0.527,1.0,NEGATIVE
