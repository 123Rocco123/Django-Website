,nan,"That was 1.5 hours and we broke 2 key levels of SPX resistance in that time. I sold the lot at that point (5965) because it signals a lot more potential downside, and if nothing else some real uncertainty. I went from being up >100% for the year to down 20% all because I wanted to minimize tax burned this year. I'm a dingus. I was successful in minimizing tax burden, though.
