Tesla..","Wait till this corona thing is over - we can fall 50-60% from the highs or the market really easily - Corona is growing at at pace of 8% if we continue to go this way in 1 month we going to have 10x worse situation and if nothing changes we will have 100x worse situation in 2 months. What those people going to do if they have nothing in savings and have no job? Morgage foreclosures will start, real estate prices going to fall, no way how to cure those troubled people.

I think it's poorly suited for this particular recession. Not a fan of Nike either. And don't get me started on TeslaI am long and strong V and MSFT forever. Although I'm not in it, good time to buy Shell. Dunno where the bottom is for energy, but we are at least near it with oil price in the low 20s, which is unsustainably low. That's the sector I'm looking for to rocket out of this recession, at least to a degree, as the recession and bear market changes the leaders and laggards in the market. Now is the time to buy for anyone who thinks energy has any future at all.",0,0.557,NEGATIVE,1.0
