They're basically creating a faster and a bit more liquid form of credit transaction. That's like corporate sponsored boy band debuting their single at a indie rock festival. It's pointless and poorly thought out. Like why would somebody not hold cash instead of buy V? What advantage does V have over cash? Literally nothing.Bitcoin is unique. And it was the first and most trusted crypto coin. It's the American Dollar equivalent in the digital currency world.,1,0.514,NEGATIVE,1.0
