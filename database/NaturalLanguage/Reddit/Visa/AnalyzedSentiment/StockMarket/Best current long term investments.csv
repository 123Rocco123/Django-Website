,"Say I recently acquired a large sum of money ~100,000$. What should I be looking to do with it currently? What to invest in? What platforms to use? So far I am thinking long term stock investments with the majority of my money. I know the market was super low and is slowly rebounding, but still volatile. I have been researching and looking into stocks i'm completely new to this. So far I really like the idea of dropping money into large companies with a good footing that should eventually recover, or have the highest chance of eventually recovering to where they were before the crash with coronavirus. I read on here some companies may not recover fully and if they do it could take 5 years. Im still young so I feel comfortable holding some for 5 years and more. Im thinking airline companies like delta, southwest, united, american, and maybe boeing, although I believe boeing is a bit more high risk with the issues they've been having with their planes. what are your thoughts on airline companies? I have also been looking at Visa and Mastercard. AMD( which is at basically its highest point ever I believe so I should wait for a drop before buying id think) , BAM( brookfield asset management), Johnson & Johnson JNJ, AT&T, and BRK.B Berkshire Hathaway seems to be a very safe buy and looks to be a decent buying point. What about oil? Shell, chevron, Exxon? likely to recover 5 years from now? Ive heard from many many people that its imperative that I diversify. This would mean 10k$ in 10 different stocks would be a much better option than 20k$ in 5 stocks or 50k$ in two stocks? Or should I split even more? Action I have taken so far: I have taken a small 300$ into robin hood to attempt swing trading. I know it is high risk especially on these volatile companies but I am willing to risk losing small amounts if it means I am learning. Currently with the 300$ I bought one share of PYPL (paypal), 5 shares of BAC (bank of america). and put limit orders on activision and penn gaming for a couple shares each. I am also going to order a book tonight. I was recommended a random walk down wall street and the neatest little guide. Which is better for a beginner?

Action I have taken so far: I have taken a small 300$ into robin hood to attempt swing trading. I know it is high risk especially on these volatile companies but I am willing to risk losing small amounts if it means I am learning. Currently with the 300$ I bought one share of PYPL (paypal), 5 shares of BAC (bank of america). and put limit orders on activision and penn gaming for a couple shares each. I am also going to order a book tonight. I was recommended a random walk down wall street and the neatest little guide. Which is better for a beginner?
