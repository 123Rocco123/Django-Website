,"Hello r/StockMarket! I am a relatively new investor with a net value of a little over $5000 in my account. My current portfolio is 10 BA, 15 MSFT, and 3 AMD. I have been building up cash and plan on depositing and investing about $2000-2500. I am deciding on a few different paths to invest in. If you were in my situation, which option would you choose and/or mix and match? I am looking for long term moderate/aggressive growth, while also stocks that I can hold onto and be confident I can go without logging into my brokerage account every day to make sure I’m not losing big time. Buy more AMD and then also buy Visa Buy all into MSFT Buy more AMD and then also buy NVDA or AAPL Go the ETF route and buy VOO and QQQ Also I heard an interesting suggestion from someone to buy stocks in home building companies or banks and to hold off on tech, your thoughts on that? Thank you for the help!","Out of those 4 options I’d go with the fourth. Look into ETFs. It hedges your overall risk. Your portfolio could use some new stocks. Maybe try and look at others to add? Or just buy a simple ETF could be S&P, Dow, NASDAQ, emerging markets, or whatever you think is best",0,0.546,POSITIVE,0.526

Thank you for the help!","VOO. If you’re going to be individually picking stocks, then use the ETF to diversify and manage some risk. I say VOO rather than QQQ because you’re already heavily tech weighted with Microsoft, and QQQ is driven by the top tech stocks. VOO has returned something like an average of 12-13% per year in the past ten years. Like most funds, it’s a buy and hold until you use the money for a big purchase / retire.",0,0.544,NEGATIVE,1.0

Thank you for the help!",I think V is a good play for you. I just started a position and it should be a more stable growth stock and possibly dividend growth to offset your tec volatility. I saw others taking about the ETFs and this could be good for you as well but it think I recommend to do the following: start a position in V and a good growth ETF (since it seems you are interested in that) and up your position in AMD. Then use the rest of anything left to even out the positions. Then you will have a few more positions to even out your portfolio swings.,0,0.555,NEGATIVE,0.988
