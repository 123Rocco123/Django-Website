,"I am a new investor and while I am learning more every day and looking into stuff more and more, Coca Cola has caught my eye. Basically, coca cola (I'll just say KO for now on) was shown to have a div/yield of around 3. On top of that, KO isn't going anywhere any time soon, and even though it's a gigantic thing, it's only at around 54 dollars per share. I'm thinking of buying a bit more shares of this than I normally would, around 19-20 or so, so I can get a decent amount of dividends and put those back into investing. Plus they pay out dividends very soon about next month, and quarterly at that. I have tried to play it as intelligently as I could, and if something may seem dumb, to me it made logical sense. I've mostly been investing in ETF's, with only Visa being my one blue collar company. I was wondering if it would be wise to then buy a few of KO as my next blue collar company, and buy more for the dividends aspect too. I do not want to invest in random stuff I don't understand like crypto, and I just want to be a long term investor. So again, as intelligently as I could think My comparison, my portfolio right now is: 2.51 shares of VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF) 3.02 shares of V (Visa) 1.05 Shares of SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF) 2.53 shares of VTV (Vanguard Value ETF) (I plan on buying a few shares of KO but here's where I come to ask if it's worth it to buy more, around 19-20 or just buy a few like I did with the others) Thanks for the help and if you read this far, thanks for reading this far too.",Yes you should also have a look at European/ Swiss Stocks good dividend payers and lagging behind.And dividends help you to keep cool in volatility as now you get something in return,0,0.535,POSITIVE,0.976
