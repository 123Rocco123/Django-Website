,"Is this a good long term stock in your opinion? The research I have done has led me to believe so and would like your opinions. I am looking to add it to my portfolio (Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Boeing, Disney, Visa, Berkshire B, and Google).","Coming from a finance background, I can tell you that valuing financial institutions (eg banks, insurance companies, etc) is really, really difficult. Here’s a couple reasons why:these companies hold some pretty complicated assets that can be tough to value (ie think about the collateralized debt obligations that banks were holding onto during the 2008 crash).they’re highly levered (eg they take out a ton of debt). This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it’s important to remember that valuations of highly levered companies can change pretty significantly with pretty minor changes in assumptions (eg how much will it cost JPmorgan to borrow money next year?)similarly, these companies do a lot of off-balance sheet financing that can get pretty complicated— even experts will have a hard time understanding what’s going on.These reasons don’t necessarily mean that a bank will be a bad long term investment; however, they indicate that understanding how this company works will be very difficult. I’d be cautious about investing long-term in companies which one can’t understand, because you will never know the right time to sell (eg the company strays from its standard practices and you no longer want to be exposed to the risk).",0,0.538,NEGATIVE,0.993
