,"And I woke up this morning and my 700 shares (200K green) of NVDA were sold while I was sleeping. Has this ever happened to you? What should I do, I feel so violated.","Yeah, that’s why there’s massive warning signs on limits for sales/stop loss. The stock split on Friday and shares were divided 10-1, bringing the price down by 10x per share and below your previously allocated limit price. The stock falling below your limit price triggered the auto sale that you previously set.Expensive mistake to make - well sort of. Now you owe taxes BUT you realized those gains. If you believe in the stock, can always buy back in.",0,0.559,NEGATIVE,1.0
