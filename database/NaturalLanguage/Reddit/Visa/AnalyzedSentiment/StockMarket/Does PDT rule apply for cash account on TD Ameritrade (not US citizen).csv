,"Hello there, In short, I'm planning to open an account on tdameritrade as a cash account with 1000usd. I'm aware of the fact margin accounts under 25k could be a problematic for day trading but I couldn't find any consistent answers for cash accounts. Also I'm not a U.S. citizen nor having a green card, working visa etc. Does anyone have any experience or information about this? Thanks a lot!","So I can answer the first part. PDT rules apply ONLY to margin accounts. But you will be tied down with what is called ""settled funds"" and ""good faith violations."" You can only trade with money that is settled (typically 2 business days after close of trade). TD will give you buying power and if you sell a stock with unsettled funds you may trigger a good faith violation.",0,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0

Thanks a lot!","No. The PDT rule only affects accounts that use margin. However, in place of the PDT rule, cash accounts can accidentally commit something called free riding, which is where the account purchases a security with unsettled funds. It takes 2-3 days (T+2) for the cash to settle.",0,0.509,NEGATIVE,1.0
