,"Visa, Microsoft, and Disney are my top 3 held companies but I haven’t bought any in months since I’ve been waiting for the price to go down except that....it’s been pretty much nothing but up for the three of them. Also looking for some advice on which of the three I should buy more of first when I get a chance.","I'm not going to suggest which to buy, but I will comment on the whole what about 52 week highs and waiting for a dip.What time frame are you looking at? I've picked up a bit of each at least once this year but I do so with the intent of holding for 30+ years. Hopefully the highs of today won't still be the all time highs in 2050. Nothing's certain but all three are companies that I'd think will be good in the long run and should weather storms reasonably well. Whether you buy at the best or worst time of the year probably doesn't make that huge of a difference many years later. You could time it nicely and get a 10% better entry point, but it's also likely that you end up waiting and buying a dip that's still higher than if you bought early. If you're sitting on a big lump of cash, you can always spread your buys out monthly or quarterly just to average in and reduce the chance and effect of buying at the best or worst times.Now if you were wondering when to buy into something like Uber or Beyond Meat where the valuation doesn't really make sense and the long term outlook is hazier, I'd be a lot more concerned with 52 week highs.",0,0.549,NEGATIVE,0.738

Nothing wrong with that.However,i think when a lot of major/popular/blue chip stocks are reaching 52 week highs, that is a sign of an overvalued market. Not to the same degree, but the market feels awfully similar to that of last year. Things were way over-valued though i think, and naturally a correction happened.Its not good to try and predict corrections and recessions, but its important to remember that the market works in cycles. Eventually, and probably within a few months, there will be a market correction. Thats just how it works.When in doubt over buying a stock, just play it safe and buy more of a broad market index like VOO or VTI. That way, your still putting your money to work, just in a safer way.Another idea would be to perform a DCF analysis. If the stock is over valued based on that..well. Based on my own estimate, VISA is overvalued. The price i've calculated is between $162-$165. Its currently at $173. I have no doubt that they're a strong company, they just happen to be overvalued; I'd rather buy VOO then.Buying VOO might not be much better if the entire market is overvalued, but when/if any correction occurs, i'll take less damage.

I'm a long term investor and while I'm always looking for the right time to buy.. when it comes to certain companies at 52 week highs I either add to my watch list to follow (if it's been trading in a cyclic or more volatile trading patterns), or sometimes you just have to buy market value because you might wait forever like an Amazon. Well I don't see Disney coming down anytime soon as they just added a nice scale-able revenue stream. The other two could dip a bit for a better timed entry.. but I'd probably balance your positions. All three have good potential to grow with multiple new verticals.. If I had to pick one first I might lean microsoft as an AI-like discovery might really boost a company and Disney's latest vertical is somewhat priced in. Visa probably just goes up slow and steady.",0,0.555,POSITIVE,0.597

Investing is about being patient. Those three are solid companies, in my opinion, ( I own MSFT and DIS) with DIS being my highest holding. Just wait until they go in sale and buy a bunch of it. Make sure to buy below their intrinsic value and you will make killer returns on top of amazing dividend growth rates. I am waiting for Visa to go on sale patiently.
