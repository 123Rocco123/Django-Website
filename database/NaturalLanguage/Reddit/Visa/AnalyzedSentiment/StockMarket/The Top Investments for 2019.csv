,"I had shared this back in January with the group talking about my top portfolio holdings going into 2019. With exception to BABA and ABBV, the rest of my top 10 holdings have absolutely crushed it. My portfolio is up over $61,000 since the beginning of 2017. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl0acHG3nzM&t=1s Microsoft (MSFT) Facebook (FB) Trex (TREX) Alibaba (BABA) Visa (V) Intuit (INTU) Adobe (ADBE) Mastercard (MA) Apple (AAPL) AbbVie (ABBV) Since 2017, I started actively posting every single buy and sell within my portfolio and writing to a list of subscribers that I had acquired from both Seeking Alpha and Stock Twits. This project has gone extremely well. Just this past month we decided to pull the trigger on Alphabet (GOOGL) into weakness, and finally added a small position in a Canopy Growth (CGC). I will be looking for further opportunities in the market as the year goes on. Obviously, as valuations become more and more stretched, opportunities are harder to come by. However, every month I will continue to analyze my portfolio and writing on it monthly to ensure that I have the strongest roster of stocks moving forward. I hope this list/video helps beginning/intermediate investors. If you're interested in reading more check me out at http://www.mkeinvestmentclub.com.
