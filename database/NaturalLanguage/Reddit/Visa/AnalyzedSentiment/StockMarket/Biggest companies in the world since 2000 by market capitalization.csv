,,"I'm always curious to see how markets have evolved over time, and one way to do it is to see what the biggest companies are in different years. It's always interesting to see that different company win and lose and there's no constant winner. In some years like 2000 and 2020, tech wins out. But for 2005 or 2010 energy firms stand out on top. Neither there is a constant sector winner. Apple and Aramco (tech and energy) are now the top 2 but I doubt that will be the case. In the next 5 years, 10 years or 15 years, what companies do you think will come to the top?",0,0.557,POSITIVE,0.95

,,"Tesla operated at a loss for plenty of time ‚Ä¶. Years‚Ä¶. Almost went bankrupt. Yes they are profitable, but the legacy automakers have been going into the space for what? Two years? So nothing when we are talking about large scale industrial shifts. Even if the other companies aren‚Äôt profitable, They will cut into Tesla‚Äôs market share.",5,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"but the legacy automakers have been going into the space for what? Two years?LOL. They have been working on EVs for much longer than two years. GM released the EV1 in 1996 and legacy auto have been making nothing but crappy EVs ever since. They have been doing this for almost 30 years now, with nothing to show for it. Saying ‚Äúcompetition is coming‚Äù means nothing. When will they actually make a compelling EV that won‚Äôt destroy their balance sheet?Yes, Tesla almost went bankrupt. And so will legacy auto. Ford, GM, and Toyota are all selling half as many vehicles as they did in 2015. They are shrinking fast while burning cash on EVs. None of you understand just how much trouble they are in.",6,0.51,NEGATIVE,1.0

,,"Those I hear are great. But I am not trying to compare cars here. Rather, I am trying to point out the dire situation many legacy automakers are in. Specifically legacy automakers with razor-thin margins who depend on selling large numbers of vehicles to make money (Ford, GM, Toyota, and so on). To my knowledge, Porsche's margins are respectable and they don't need to sell millions of vehicles in order survive.",6,0.509,POSITIVE,0.876
,,"GM has committed to all-electric by 2035.By that same year, it will be illegal to purchase most gas powered consumer vehicles in several countries in Europe.Combustion vehicles are being phased out in the developed world. If automakers don't go electric, they go out of business. If you think that this is all just ""talk"" then you've really gotta do some recalibrating.",5,0.547,NEGATIVE,0.998
,,"GM has committed to all-electric by 2035.More talk. What have GM actually done? Because their track record (i.e., the Bolt) suggests they don't know what they're doing.By that same year, it will be illegal to purchase most gas powered consumer vehicles in several countries in Europe.Bruh, 2035 is such a comedically long time frame. It's obvious that the European government consulted with automakers and their unions first before announcing that deadline. Plus the law has not been enacted yet. If it never actually passes, then, well, that was more hot air they were blowing around.I don't know why everyone on this sub seems to nurse a boner for their local automaker. No ruthless profit-seeking company deserves anyone's respect. They need to be held up to critical scrutiny, like any other public figure.",6,0.538,NEGATIVE,1.0
