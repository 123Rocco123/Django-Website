I have 10 and WILL increase to at least 100 shares by 20 years old. Realty Income (O) is twice the dividend but twice the volatility. That is why I own half the shares of that I own of SPHD. Visa (V) is a gem. I bought on a low day at 103, at has never been below that price. I will KEEP FOREVER. Now, Disney (DIS) is a difficult one. The 3 month chart shows that it dropped heavily twice. Both by different causes. I bought on the day of the CEO saying there would be slow growth, at 97.50. Good price. It is now at $100 and will gladly hold for the REST OF MY LIFE.
