,,"From the previous links:Here are 2 common ways that brokerage customers can earn interest on their uninvested cash, each with different features.One option is a sweep that automatically deposits your money into a bank. These deposits typically are insured by the federal government through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which guarantees principal and interest within certain limits. For example, Fidelity's Cash Management Account is an option for investors seeking FDIC insurance. It also offers checking, bill paying, and ATM access.Another way that brokerage firms pay clients for their uninvested cash is by sweeping it into money market funds. While these do not offer insurance by the FDIC, they are relatively safe options, as the securities in the account are insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) up to $500,000. SIPC is a nonprofit organization that protects stocks, bonds, and other securities in case a brokerage firm goes bankrupt and assets are missing, but it does not insure against the failure or insolvency of the money market fund itself.Money market funds also typically pay higher interest rates than bank sweeps. For example, as of September 30, 2019, the 7-day yield on Fidelity Government Money Market Fund ( SPAXX | Get Prospectus ) was 1.63%.* This fund generally invests at least 99.5% of the fund's total assets in cash, US government securities and repurchase agreements. Fidelity brokerage accounts that sweep to money market funds also offer check-writing, bill pay, and ATMs.you can buy cd's and your money market and cash management accounts are either FDIC insured via sweep or SIPC insured and extremely, basically planck scale, low risk (basically low cost short term gov't bond contracts).",6,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.956

,,"i also want to point out that using fidelity cash management account as a primary account doesn't exclude you from having other accounts. on the contrary, you can have your paycheck deposited into fidelity and then transfer out whatever amount you want up to your balance to any number of registered accounts (with you or other account holders name) without limit or fees.i have like 3 other checking accounts and 3 different savings accounts, all FDIC insured, 2 roth iras, and a credit union account.in 8 years of having a fidelity cash management account, i have had very, very few issues, none of which weren't immediately solved by a call to Fidelity. One time i had issues with ELAN, the company that runs the Fidelity Cash Rewards Signature Visa, and i called into fidelity, who listened in while i tried and once again failed to get what we both agreed i was due, and when that failed they took over the call, put me on hold, and when i was reconnected the ELAN rep was a full 180. AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!",6,0.522,POSITIVE,0.859
