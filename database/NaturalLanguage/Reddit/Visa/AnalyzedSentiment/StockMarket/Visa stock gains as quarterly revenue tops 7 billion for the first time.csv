,,Merchants are not paying from pockets they pass the expense to the consumer. They only pocket the fee if the customer is paying through cash.Merchants have a choice not to accept electronic payment systems and use only cash. They will be able to determine whether the fee is worth it or not.,1,0.516,NEGATIVE,1.0

,,"Nobody said that merchants don’t have to pay the fees. Just like merchants pay for electricity, water and possibly rent. Oh the transportation cost to and from the shop and for workers. These are expenses for the business/merchant just like visa fees.",3,0.548,POSITIVE,0.983

,,I don’t understand your point. The choice is still merchants’. If Visa is charging too much they have choice not to accept it. No one is forcing them to use it. There are several benefits of accepting credit and debit cards but if the fees outweigh the benefits then there should be no reason to accept right?,5,0.512,NEGATIVE,0.979
