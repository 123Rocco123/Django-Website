,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop trader who trades equities. This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all the stocks on here, or none of them, and stocks not on here on any given day! I only hold MAG7/general broad market indices long-term, unless otherwise noted in the ticker. If you use old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly. I usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. Some stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on _____?” or “Is ___ a good investment?” will be ignored unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll. News: AT&T Says New Hack Includes Records of Customer Calls, Texts We saw the markets sell off yesterday due to the CPI news, think we’re going to have a relatively flat day today. TSLA - We saw TSLA delay their Robotaxi Event from August to October watching for some form of bounce in the stock. Currently long, but will remain agile (as usual) if we selloff at the open. NVDA - We also saw this turn more strongly than the other Mag7 stocks because of the close to 20% move we saw it make in the past week. No opinion on this yet, but watching for a setup. T - Announces massive hack of customer data, includes records of customer calls/texts. SNOW - AT&T ($T) had their customer data illegaly downloaded from a workspace on a third-party cloud platform (identified as SNOW’s). Might be user error/social engineering (not sure) rather than a cybersecurity issue, so we might see a reversal of this move at the open. However, it should noted that there were no multifactor authentication safeguards in place in previous hacks of SNOW. JPM - Reports $4.40 vs $4.19 expected EPS. NI at $18B was up 25% from the same period a year ago due to exchange of shares in Visa that provided $8B in gains. Earnings: None I’m interested in IPOs: None I’m interested in","Pretty clearly stated on yesterday's watchlist I sold half my position when it spiked from the CPI numbers and got stopped out of the other half at 199 lol.https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1e0owqd/these_are_the_stocks_on_my_watchlist_711/AMZN- Took advantage of the CPI spike and exited out half of part of my AMZN position, will hold rest back to a stop at 199. Other than that, still holding half. We DID open at a lower low today (but that can partially be attributed to CPI). Will likely remove this after today.",0,0.506,NEGATIVE,1.0

I sold most already but thinking it still has potential to go higherRIVN- up now over 55% this month. I was lucky to buy at the right time and sold most about 2 weeks ago. didn’t want to buy more because of EV news and production in general. I messed up on that.RUN- didn’t expect solar to have such a powerful rally this past week. I sold most since there’s not much support for solar in general or “interest” like there is for the AI sectorCorrect me if I’m wrong and add any opinions on these stocks. Especially since you have been watching RIVN for a while and now QS is helping VW with their vehicles.,0,0.53,NEGATIVE,0.999
