,"I want to thank the moderator and community for providing feedback. I want to know what you all want to learn! I have dedicated a blog and Youtube channel towards investing education as I feel it is extremely important to know not only what to buy, but when to buy it. FOR EXAMPLE, I hear people talking about buying Ford (F) or other automakers. Understand that when the market goes into bear territory, the automakers and real estate stocks will get hammered. PEOPLE STOP BORROWING MONEY AND THE BANKS TIGHTEN. Then when interest rates fall, the automakers bottom out! Cash is going to become the king here eventually, but until then, we have to be very selective about what we buy at the end of this bull market! Some of my largest holdings that I'm accumulating now include Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY), two Chinese giants in all of the right industries. Both trade at reasonable valuations and are down significantly off their highs from geopolitical concerns. Additionally, I think Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), and PayPal (PYPL) are worth owning as the future shifts from cash to card and digital currency. Look at some great American brands for conservative growth such as Starbucks (SBUX) and PepsiCo (PEP). Finally, 2018 hasn't been a great year for FANG, but I remain optimistic because Facebook (FB) is a behemoth with unbelievably strong cash flow and I don't see their margins falling as much as analysts have forecast. PICK WINNING STOCKS EVERYONE, AND ALWAYS HAVE AN EXIT PLAN. The market doesn't always make sense, but hopefully I can help you make sense of what is happening. Look for rocky roads up until midterms. Below is a link to my youtube channel, this is a decent beginner video! PLEASE COMMENT WHAT YOU WANT ME TO MAKE A VIDEO ON AND I WILL TRY TO CREATE 1 PER WEEK! https://youtu.be/IUu9PyvnBds",You really got some sleeper picks in here. Some real undiscovered gems.
