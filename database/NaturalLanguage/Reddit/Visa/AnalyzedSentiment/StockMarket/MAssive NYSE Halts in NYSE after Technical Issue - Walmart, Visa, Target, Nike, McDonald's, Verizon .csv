,,"Everyone flipped a shit over this but there's a very good reason for it and it isn't even related to government regulation it deals with actuaries who work at lending agencies for the clearing houses who do a risk assessment to decide how much money the exchanges need to have to satisfy their own investors. (like Robinhood as just one example, who at that time was having a huge influx of new customers, and letting them buy and sell the same day even though their money they added to their accounts from the bank wouldn't officially clear for a few days, essentially meaning the huge surge of new customers are trading on credit for meme stocks, driving up the risk factor for the lender).Sell orders weren't affected, because there is no risk of becoming illiquid from sell orders, only buy orders. Robinhood is one I remember specifically as being literally unable to place more orders for these specific stocks as per the requirements of their own lender, and they were in the process of securing more funds the moment this all occured.The people who say this is a nebulous conspiracy to favor hedge funds over regular retail investors are just making their boring lives seem more interesting.",5,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.999

,,"1 algorithm controls 10-30 stocks at a time. They make same moves and have same wicksIt's called ""statistical arbitrage"" and has been going on since the 1980's. They search for cointegrated groups of anything and trade accordingly making tiny bits off individual trader noise that goes against the trend. Essentially sell 'relative high' and buy 'relative low' across time and instrument. This reinforces co-correlation which would exist naturally from fundamental factors like similar industries experiencing similar macroeconomic conditions.Only extreme company-specific news goes against this pattern. If you notice, biotech firms, which have widely varying outcomes and very large binary news events (trial or regulatory fail or pass), trade less correlated with one another. StatArb will want to stay away from those. My guess is that they take off positions around any news events and have different algorithms for those time periods.The absolute masters of it is RenTech, the most profitable hedge fund in history. Nobody has ever disclosed their exact algorithms but one of their principals once said something roughly like ""so, where do market correlations come from anyway?""They are everywhere, and have unparalleled technology and the lowest trading costs of anyone. I read an estimate that they alone are 10% of volume.they froze all 5 stocks for 1 day, changed to sell only & the algorithm spent all day liquidating peoples money down.That's totally different and was human intervention.",4,0.529,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"Ty for extra information. Interesting read. CheersI do 100% disagree with the ""That's totally different & was human interventio nthough. The same ""controllers"" algorithm/program detecting these trades automatically are also part of the human intervention...For the 1st time in history social media & human interaction caused all the poor & middle class people to band together & buy 5 stocks... The program detected this and the next morning the button was pushed to halt them for an entire day.. not only that but was changed to allow selling only also.... That to me is a coordinated plan from detection > solution for them.Millions of poor & middle class Americans should have shared Billions of $ in profits that day from winning against this program & its controller.. instead the rules were changed for 1 single trading day, for the first time in history.... to protect their profit... they were allowed to change the rules for 1 fucking day vs the entire population & world.",5,0.525,NEGATIVE,1.0
