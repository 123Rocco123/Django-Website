,"Hi guys, I am in the process of filling out the documents for an application for a broker in the US. As part of my application I have to tell the broker where I am going to pay taxes. Once I start day trading, I will talk to a tax professional about this, but I am not really keen on spending so much money before I even have a broker. So maybe some of you are in a similar or even the same situation and could share your knowledge. I am a German citizen with my primary residence still in Germany. I have now been living in South Africa since February on a student visa and am most likely going to stay until July 2021. I am not even registered here in South Africa, as I never went to the town hall to do that. For some of you the answer might be crystal clear, but I am actually uncertain if I will have to pay taxes in Germany or South Africa. Thanks for any advice.",You could register for a broker from your phone and trade online without paying any tax. Iâ€™m a German citizen also and thatâ€™s how trade without paying a single penny for tax,0,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.939

If you have trading income it will need to be taxed. I mean if you are with a German broker they would deduct the tax for you already. I'll be going with a US broker though.",1,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.999

Thanks for any advice.",As you still have a resident in Germany you are unbeschrÃ¤nkt einkommensteuerpflichtig according to the EStG in Germany and therefore must pay taxes in Germany on â€žall incomesâ€œ including trading income. Having said that there are exceptions to stop dual taxation. One of these will probably apply as you are probably required to pay taxes in South Africa as well. I would suggest to inform you on the taxation in South Africa and on exceptions regarding dual taxation.
