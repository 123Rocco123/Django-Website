,Currently holding PayPal stock. Up 20% in the last year or so. Considering selling this stock and buy visa or MasterCard instead on a dip.

On top of this they own Venmo, which one 2018, processed $62 Billion. Venmo (PayPal), CashApp (Square), and Apple seem to be in the beat position when cross boarder payments become easy.All 3 companies seem to have major room for growth.",5,0.533,NEGATIVE,1.0
