,"I am a known massive proponent for the transaction fintechs, and have written a multitude of posts on them in the last 3 years. Apart from diligent financial analysis and modeling, the largest reason for these massive long positions is Sweden. Sweden is a world leader of digital payments, spawning multiple large fintechs platforms, such as Swish (Sweden domestic only), Klarna (Global payments), and iZettle (PayPal acquisition). As one of the world leaders of fintech, I use what works in Sweden to project into the US. In the latest Central Bank (Riksbanken) report, Swish (Swedish Venmo/Cashapp) has surpassed total cash usage. It's used eveywhere, by everyone. Combine this potential future with Cashapp and Venmo (both of which show profitable margins), the potential for Square & PayPal is much larger than is currently priced in. These stocks may look very over valued as of now, if you draw a line between where their e wallets are now to where swish is in Sweden, they have very very far to go. SQ is especially hot as of this week after a smash earnings, but I have a massive conviction that this isn't the last smash quarter they will have. Over the next 5 years I am extremely confident they will both outperform the market in raw e-wallet growth. For the first time, cash will be monitized by private corporations. You don't want to miss it. I mostly made this post for people who doesn't know how far e wallets have come in frontiers. In 5 years, cash will be very very close to dead in sweden. In 20, it'll be gone. Someone will profit and perhaps become the visa / Mastercard of the new age.

Get in. Disclosure: Gargantuan Square position and large PayPal.","Square ($SQ) is going to be a $1 trillion dollar company in my lifetime. I am honestly amazed how well this company is positioning themselves. They will move away from small business as they slowly replace the wallet and cash of the US. Similar things have already happened in Sweden, world leader in digital payments. Square is doing the same but in the US, while being the best trusted bitcoin handler and small business backend.They are slowly turning into the business bank of the future with a banking charter, small business loans, and both physical and online sales platforms. They have an amazing network effect similar to Shopify where it's very unrewarding for companies to switch sway from them but very rewarding to join up. Meanwhile, they are creating a profitable massively growing replacement for cash in the cashapp. True financial revolution.Only downside is their valuation which I still think may not be high enough, especially not if covid continues.",1,0.557,POSITIVE,0.999
