That was my legitimate suggestion. Maybe budget 10% or so for single stocks you trust like Apple or MS in your case",2,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.998

The big names are fine, but at this point, you could just get a few accumulating ETFs so your dividends are freely reinvested and there's that.In my view, it is not a good balance to invest in many individual equities for the long term. You still have to keep an eye on 10+ companies, while you are not reaping the benefits of active trading. I chose long term buy-and-hold because I got tired of constantly reading news, earnings reports, managing watchlists etc. Obviously most companies on your list are very safe bets, but I couldn't just live without checking on them constantly. And in that case, why not index funds.",0,0.53,NEGATIVE,0.994
