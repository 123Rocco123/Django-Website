,"So, with all of the sick gains people are posting, can we talk about what people can expect this year and next for taxes? I'll start. In Washington State: long term capital gains will have a 9% tax rate. If you hold stocks more than a year, get out of Washington State now. Especially all of you tech workers. Your vested stock is gonna get raped!

Update #1: Some reading material I'm re-posting from another thread so it's in one place. There are some good organizations that are tracking it. That's where I get the information from. A quick list: https://wallethub.com/edu/states-with-highest-lowest-tax-burden/20494 These guys are great: https://taxfoundation.org So are they guys: https://www.taxpolicycenter.org My personal favorite: https://taxfoundation.org/publications/state-local-tax-burden-rankings/ And of course this: https://www.usa.gov/state-taxes You'll never get the whole picture form a politician. Cities, counties and states double down on local taxes whenever politicians realize people have anxiety about federal tax changes. And visa-versa. That is one reason, IMO, single-party rule at all levels of government is a very bad idea. But, that's a different conversation.
