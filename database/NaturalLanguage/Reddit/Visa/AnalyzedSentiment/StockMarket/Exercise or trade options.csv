,"This is probably a very generic question and I get that the answer differs based on risk tolerance / age / financial situation etc etc. but I wanted to hear what folks think about my situation. $V has been very good to me for the last 2 years and I’ve been long on the stock. Early in 2019 I got greedy and bought a 140 call option for it expiring 1/15/2021 for $1900. This was when the stock was at ~$115. Now fast forward 2 years, I’m nearing the expiration date of the option and it is worth $7600, and $V stock is ~$216. Should I sell the option and secure $5.5k of profit, or should I exercise it and get 100 shares of Visa @140? (I already own 50 shares of Visa). Both these seem good options to me and I’m not being able to make a decision!",Sell the option,0,0.528,NEGATIVE,0.976

I like to buy/sell options but rarely exercise (though I'm a small timer for sure) them. However on stocks where you really believe in them long term, exercising the option could be even more valuable.Say you sell the V option and pocket the $5,500 (assuming this is your profits), but then a year or two from now V makes another 25% increase and you miss out on those profits. So if you believe in the stock, exercising the option would/could be more profitable in the future than just selling.Another thing to consider is if you do exercise the option, you will have 150 shares of Visa. Then with 100 shares, you can start selling options to bring in more income. If you did this, I would sell out of the money puts or calls (depends on your outlook) and only do this in the short term, month or less. So if you thought V will continue to rise, I would sell weekly to a month, out of the money puts.",0,0.542,NEGATIVE,1.0

I guess it just boils down to whether I want my money to be invested in V or something else. Do you know if exercising an option have any tax implication if I don’t sell the stock? Or is the cost basis of the 100 V stocks the strike price and I pay taxes on selling price - this cost, when I sell the stock?",1,0.547,NEGATIVE,1.0
