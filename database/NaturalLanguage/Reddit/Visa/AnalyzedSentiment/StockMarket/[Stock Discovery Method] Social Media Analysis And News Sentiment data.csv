,"Ive been a big fan of using social media and mainstream news stock sentiment to find upcoming stocks. It a great discovery method. I thought i would share some of my findings. Main Stream News Let's look at the top 10 companies mentioned in the mainstream news in the past 4 weeks: Amazon.com, Inc. Netflix, Inc Pfizer Inc AstraZeneca PLC Apple Inc Marcus & Millichap, Inc Tesla, Inc Facebook Inc Twitter Inc Microsoft Corporation Source. Nothing out of the ordinary here, mostly blue chip stocks. Pfizer and AstraZeneca have dominated the news cycle mostly because of the vaccine rollout. Google search trends show and increase in interest roughly the same time as the pandemic started. Pfizer still showing allot of momentum. Many of these stocks are pretty overvalued unfortunately, with an EV to sales ratio of more then 5. Pfizer is about 6~. Personally not my thing. Google Search Volume However lets look at the top 20 stocks in terms of google search volume, in the past 4 weeks: Tilray, Inc. NIO Inc. Tyme Technologies Inc ELive Ventures Inc AstraZeneca PLC540 CCIVChurchill Capital Corp IV Atlantic Power Corp Snap Inc. Netflix, Inc. Visa Inc Uxin Ltd Casa Systems Inc Aurora Cannabis Inc Realty Income Corporation AT&T Inc. GTT Communications, Inc. Canaan Inc. JD.com, Inc. Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co Pandora Media Inc Source. Many overvalued stocks here, with a EV to sales ratio more then 5, (NIO is at 283!). However if we do a quick analysis of each company, we can find a few gems. For example JD, has a EV to Sales ratio below 1, a very high market share, and a avg revenue growth of about 8%~. Not bad! So why is this company so undervalued? Well a quick scan of recent headlines show the Chinese gov cracking down on many Chinese tech companies. Many negative news headlines have scared investors away. However company fundamentals remains strong. It might be a great time to buy! Using this discovery method ive found some really great gems, ill post about my track record soon. *This is not financial advise, please do your own research!","Hi u/mrpoopybutthole1262, I'm also interested in financial news and the sentiment of the different companies which actually could help us on our investment decisions somehow ;)While we could pay more focus on the stocks with positiver sentiment, we also have another eye on the ones which were the sentiment laggards. The list of the S&P500 stocks from last week were a good example:https://i.postimg.cc/htQGQ9S3/SP500.pngWish you all have a good day!",0,0.551,POSITIVE,0.949
