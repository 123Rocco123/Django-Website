,"This week we saw some CRAZY action in a few names that began to trend around social media. Let’s look at the following charts: SKLZ, VIH, and BBIG. Eventually traders FOMO’d into the trade chasing 25-100% gains… but it’s important to note that these high-reward plays are also VERY risky. Remember, nobody really knows where a stock will go. As an investor or swing-trader it’s your duty to manage risk and use entry points that are suitable for protecting your hard-earned dollars. If you are swing-trading, as many of us enjoy doing, there are a few rules I live by when entering a position: If it’s based on sentiment avoid the red zones (FOMO zones) that I usually highlight on the charts. I try entering on a green or orange zone for the best risk/reward if it’s on a name I’d like to take a chance with. If it’s based on technicals, WAIT for the opportunity. There are hundreds of high-quality stocks, you don’t need to jump into a trade because it’s hot right now. Be patient with your entries and I guarantee you will become a better trader. For those of you that don’t remember or haven’t read some of my earlier posts. Red Zone = FOMO area and very high-risk, high-reward play. Orange Zone = The stock has normalized back a reasonable level, but is still somewhat volatile. r/R (risk/reward) is already way better than a red zone. Green Zone = The stock is at a much better post-hype entry level. This area is a prime risk-to-reward when looking at a swing trade. Here are the charts. SKLZ SKLZ took off early in the week. The red zones are clearly defined on days the stock went up 10-25%. This is a chart with a very short-term timeframe, so the orange level is still somewhat risky. If SKLZ drops back into the green zone, it might be a better entry level. Note: I had this stock on my list a few weeks ago at $13.50, currently sitting at $12. This goes to show not all my watch-list stocks are winners. VIH This SPAC started trending Thursday and Friday after the share price increased 15%. I’m going to stay away from this name since, generally speaking, the general SPAC trade that was popular earlier this year has been extremely under-performing since April. BBIG BBIG is a name that has trended BIGLY on Reddit and Twitter, pun intended. The stock squeezed to $5 in June and then fell to nearly $2 a share just two weeks ago. This is a great example of how one bad FOMO trade can completely wreck your portfolio. Those who were chasing this name in June at $4 after the stock doubled saw their positions cut in half by July. A few weeks ago and back in the $2-3 range the risk/reward was becoming more favorable, but after recent price action it’s in my no-fly zone. Personally, if this gets back to $5-6 it might look interesting, but not right now. What’s the difference between trading on technicals or sentiment? Whether you are trading on technicals or hype, they are very similar. They BOTH require lots of patience and waiting for the correct entry. Here are some points describing them: Sentiment/Hype Avoid FOMO/red zones Patiently wait for hype around the stock to calm down to pre-squeeze levels Are known to have explosive squeezes that can yield a 40-50% or more return in a matter of days Sentiment stocks are known to catch new waves frequently (think AMC in February and then again recently in May/June) Technicals Identify uptrends, support/resistance, break-outs, and consolidation Wait for the stock to get to your entry point Swing-trading on technicals can yield 10-30% per play The goal is to help identify plays that have become favorable for a swing-trade. This requires lots of patience, but can be very rewarding if you stick to the process. When you have at least a 6-month time-frame/outlook when getting into a position you greatly increase your chances of turning it into a winner. Don’t aim for 100% gains in one week. Aim for 20-30% return in 6 months. This, of course, works for long-term buy and holds as well as medium-term swing trades. My portfolio is divided into the following two segments: Long-term holds (6-months to 2 year outlook) Swing-trades (come out profitable in 6 months, if it happens earlier that’s great, but not expected) I want to make it clear that I absolutely never day-trade. Soon I am going to move my swing-trade segment of my portfolio to a different broker so I can highlight trades and make them easier to display. The BTFD List Visa (V) Visa is at short-term lows. The upward channel/trend just broke down and it is currently sitting at support of ~$225. I might enter here looking for a bounce back to $240-250 level. My short-term risk is potentially seeing this at $210, a 6% loss, while I think the upside could be 10-20%. Visa is also a relatively safe blue chip stock that pays a dividend and RSI is hitting some solid over-sold ratings. UPS UPS’ share price took a hit after earnings just a month ago. It consolidated for a full month and has recently crossed back over the 50 EMA (orange line), while sitting right at the 100 EMA (dotted blue line). We might see that earnings gap get filled and a bounce back to $210 level. With the holiday season coming up it would be wise to keep an eye on economical data such as retail sales, consumer spending, and e-commerce earnings reports. I like UPS at this price. The MEME List Purple Mattress (PRPL) Purple Mattress has been in a slow decline since May. I think we’ll find some support here at the $23 range. It will face some resistance at $30 level, but if it gets enough momentum to go past we could see this back in the $35 range. PRPL has been known to pick up on social hype and it could be an interesting entry point for a swing trade here. UI Path (PATH) NOTE: Earnings Tuesday September 7th after the close. UI Path IPO’d in April and is down 25% from the highs. PATH is a growth stock so this is more on the risky side. I am LONG shares of PATH from about $61, currently $63. ARKK ETF currently holds this stock at roughly 2% weight of the ETF. Here’s a look at some option flow from Friday, courtesy of the Vig platform. A few lots of over 1,000 calls were bought with an expiration of Sept 17. That’s all for this week everyone.

Eventually traders FOMO’d into the trade chasing 25-100% gains… but it’s important to note that these high-reward plays are also VERY risky. Remember, nobody really knows where a stock will go. As an investor or swing-trader it’s your duty to manage risk and use entry points that are suitable for protecting your hard-earned dollars. If you are swing-trading, as many of us enjoy doing, there are a few rules I live by when entering a position: If it’s based on sentiment avoid the red zones (FOMO zones) that I usually highlight on the charts. I try entering on a green or orange zone for the best risk/reward if it’s on a name I’d like to take a chance with. If it’s based on technicals, WAIT for the opportunity. There are hundreds of high-quality stocks, you don’t need to jump into a trade because it’s hot right now. Be patient with your entries and I guarantee you will become a better trader. For those of you that don’t remember or haven’t read some of my earlier posts. Red Zone = FOMO area and very high-risk, high-reward play. Orange Zone = The stock has normalized back a reasonable level, but is still somewhat volatile. r/R (risk/reward) is already way better than a red zone. Green Zone = The stock is at a much better post-hype entry level. This area is a prime risk-to-reward when looking at a swing trade. Here are the charts. SKLZ SKLZ took off early in the week. The red zones are clearly defined on days the stock went up 10-25%. This is a chart with a very short-term timeframe, so the orange level is still somewhat risky. If SKLZ drops back into the green zone, it might be a better entry level. Note: I had this stock on my list a few weeks ago at $13.50, currently sitting at $12. This goes to show not all my watch-list stocks are winners. VIH This SPAC started trending Thursday and Friday after the share price increased 15%. I’m going to stay away from this name since, generally speaking, the general SPAC trade that was popular earlier this year has been extremely under-performing since April. BBIG BBIG is a name that has trended BIGLY on Reddit and Twitter, pun intended. The stock squeezed to $5 in June and then fell to nearly $2 a share just two weeks ago. This is a great example of how one bad FOMO trade can completely wreck your portfolio. Those who were chasing this name in June at $4 after the stock doubled saw their positions cut in half by July. A few weeks ago and back in the $2-3 range the risk/reward was becoming more favorable, but after recent price action it’s in my no-fly zone. Personally, if this gets back to $5-6 it might look interesting, but not right now. What’s the difference between trading on technicals or sentiment? Whether you are trading on technicals or hype, they are very similar. They BOTH require lots of patience and waiting for the correct entry. Here are some points describing them: Sentiment/Hype Avoid FOMO/red zones Patiently wait for hype around the stock to calm down to pre-squeeze levels Are known to have explosive squeezes that can yield a 40-50% or more return in a matter of days Sentiment stocks are known to catch new waves frequently (think AMC in February and then again recently in May/June) Technicals Identify uptrends, support/resistance, break-outs, and consolidation Wait for the stock to get to your entry point Swing-trading on technicals can yield 10-30% per play The goal is to help identify plays that have become favorable for a swing-trade. This requires lots of patience, but can be very rewarding if you stick to the process. When you have at least a 6-month time-frame/outlook when getting into a position you greatly increase your chances of turning it into a winner. Don’t aim for 100% gains in one week. Aim for 20-30% return in 6 months. This, of course, works for long-term buy and holds as well as medium-term swing trades. My portfolio is divided into the following two segments: Long-term holds (6-months to 2 year outlook) Swing-trades (come out profitable in 6 months, if it happens earlier that’s great, but not expected) I want to make it clear that I absolutely never day-trade. Soon I am going to move my swing-trade segment of my portfolio to a different broker so I can highlight trades and make them easier to display. The BTFD List Visa (V) Visa is at short-term lows. The upward channel/trend just broke down and it is currently sitting at support of ~$225. I might enter here looking for a bounce back to $240-250 level. My short-term risk is potentially seeing this at $210, a 6% loss, while I think the upside could be 10-20%. Visa is also a relatively safe blue chip stock that pays a dividend and RSI is hitting some solid over-sold ratings. UPS UPS’ share price took a hit after earnings just a month ago. It consolidated for a full month and has recently crossed back over the 50 EMA (orange line), while sitting right at the 100 EMA (dotted blue line). We might see that earnings gap get filled and a bounce back to $210 level. With the holiday season coming up it would be wise to keep an eye on economical data such as retail sales, consumer spending, and e-commerce earnings reports. I like UPS at this price. The MEME List Purple Mattress (PRPL) Purple Mattress has been in a slow decline since May. I think we’ll find some support here at the $23 range. It will face some resistance at $30 level, but if it gets enough momentum to go past we could see this back in the $35 range. PRPL has been known to pick up on social hype and it could be an interesting entry point for a swing trade here. UI Path (PATH) NOTE: Earnings Tuesday September 7th after the close. UI Path IPO’d in April and is down 25% from the highs. PATH is a growth stock so this is more on the risky side. I am LONG shares of PATH from about $61, currently $63. ARKK ETF currently holds this stock at roughly 2% weight of the ETF. Here’s a look at some option flow from Friday, courtesy of the Vig platform. A few lots of over 1,000 calls were bought with an expiration of Sept 17. That’s all for this week everyone.
