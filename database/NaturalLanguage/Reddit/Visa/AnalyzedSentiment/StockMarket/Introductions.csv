,"Hello! I think it's interesting to see what people are doing in the stock market. What they're interested in and what their greatest wins and losses are. I'll go first. I appreciate and expect comments and advice! I'm super new to stocks and this community. I always had a 401K but never knew I could have almost complete control of it. As I said before I had a great Friday with SPCE. I’m up almost 21 dollars per share with 15 of that happening on Friday. I see it going up for the next month. Branson was rumored to try and break orbit on the 4th beating Bezos. If B pulls that off I can't imagine how high the stock will jump. I bought the stock because SpaceX and Blue Horizon are private. That made me do a little research and now I pretty much have 150 to 250 each of most of the space stocks listed in ARKX most bought before I knew ARK existed. I learned about the Schwab brokerage 401k account in February. I bought some Visa and Chevron 10k each and used 30k for stocks I am interested in. Totaling about 28 percent of my 401k. I left the rest in my company 401k because its been doing great. The main funds being in an Index fund, a 2040 retirement fund, a mid cap and small cap fund. I don’t plan to take anymore out of the company 401k because I don’t trust myself and it's been doing great. So…. Most of my money is in: Balanced company ran 401K Stocks I am interested in: Space stocks Biggest win: 200 Shares of SPCE at $34.99 (+$20.92) Biggest loss: 125 shares of MGNI at $50.27 (-$13.77) Focus: Hold Long term",I trade options in my rollover traditional IRA (currently amd sndl wish nok) run the wheel in my Roth and leave my 401k in roughly 50% growth 25% s%p and 25 mid/small cap mix,0,0.535,POSITIVE,0.967

Lol. My co worker bought is at $6. Him talking about it was what made me start my own Schwab account. Of course It it dropped 20 dollars after I bought it. I has slowly started to gain a little.
