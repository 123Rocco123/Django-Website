,,"This is misreporting. Both Visa and Mastercard will continue to operate in Russia. Read the fine print. The impact is fucking zero. They just blocked the Russian-issued cards from being used abroad, meaning that they punish people trying to flee the country, hurting the wrong guys.",0,0.507,NEGATIVE,1.0

,,"Russian natural gas isn‚Äôt sanctioned. $500MM-700MM / day is no laughing amount especially when the majority of large energy companies in Russia is owned by Oligarchs.This is a splash in the bucket even if true, almost attune to the impact of using ##BlackLivesMatter instead of actual reform.Wake me up when EU/NATO sanctions the larger exports, even then:What‚Äôs to stop Russia from selling crude to China, and China selling its own crude back to EU? You gonna sanction China?End-game globalization - electric boogaloo",1,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.985
,,"UnionPay will move in. No vacuum will be left. In 2015 the UnionPay overtook Visa and Mastercard in a total amount of value of payment transactions made by customers and became the largest card payment processing organization (debit and credit cards combined) in the world surpassing the two. Since 2006, China UnionPay cards can be used in over 100 countries outside China.",0,0.527,POSITIVE,0.994

,,"I agree. There is no right for sure and I understand that issue. But when something becomes the ""norm"" and as prevalent as credit cards in society and cash or checks are not really a major thing anywhere (especially after Covid), it's a delicate situation.

,,"I'm torn somewhat because everyday Russians don't want war, but at the end of the day the Russian people have voted for Putin since 2000. They have allowed him and his cronies to take over the country with virtually no accountability.",1,0.529,POSITIVE,0.834
,,"I doubt that was fare elections (just like in Belarus, although Russia didn‚Äôt fake it so obviously) Edit: also Putin changes the law as he pleases E.g. earlier he was not allowed to be president for more than 2 terms - now he can, b fore it was 4 years now it‚Äôs 6",2,0.522,NEGATIVE,0.869
,,"Correct, elections are not fair in Russia but the Russian people haven't demanded accountability from their politicians, judges, police officers, or really anyone.Russians have voted in Putin because he provided stability and an improved standard of living the past couple of decades. But sadly, if we zoom out we see that the average Russian is poorer than the average Pole and Poland has nowhere the amount of natural resources/wealth Russia has.The Russian people, due to fears of turmoil/another revolution or collapse/apathy/belief that 'they're all the same no matter who we vote in', have let things slide as long as they could put food on the table, buy an iPhone, and vacation in Egypt or Thailand once a year.",3,0.523,NEGATIVE,0.976
,,Putin got rid of all the opposition so there‚Äôs really not much choice. Plus this is so naive to think that ‚Äúdemanding accountability‚Äù would help. just think about it - people in Russia can get up to 5 years in prison for speaking against war. This is absolute nonsense! Also I think the Belarus example from last year doesn‚Äôt help - the whole country rose up against the government and it didn‚Äôt change anything,4,0.545,NEGATIVE,1.0

,,"Russia is just extending the exclusive market to china with these sanctions. It is only going to hurt the west. But given there are so many protests in almost every major city against Russia, the west had to do something. This time China will be the beneficiary of neutrality about what has happened to Switzerland so far.World is changing, power is shifting.Let's see how long peace lasts and how long humanity lasts.",0,0.534,POSITIVE,0.909
