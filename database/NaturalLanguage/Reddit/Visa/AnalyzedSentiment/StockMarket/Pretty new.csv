,"Hy guys i wanna ask if the investment that i made are good, i have 23 years old and i started in march 2022 to invest and if you have some tips to give :) thanks ☺️","If you're pretty new, you have the power to start right. Ditch most your stocks, create an all ETF portfolio and contribute to it on a monthly basis.Here's an example of how I would build a portfolio from scratch:40% - VT (World Market)30% - VIG (US Dividend Growth)10% - KXI (World Consumer Staples)10% - VUG (US Growth)10% - High Conviction Stocks",0,0.558,POSITIVE,0.978
,"Hy guys i wanna ask if the investment that i made are good, i have 23 years old and i started in march 2022 to invest and if you have some tips to give :) thanks ☺️","Definitely avoid KXI. The ER is not justifiable given it’s mostly US consumer staples. I personally wouldn’t add VIG and VUG as they more or less cancel each other out. VIG is kind of a poor way to try to access factors, but it’s not the absolute worst. VUG is not a particularly sensible fund to add to this kind of portfolio.",1,0.508,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Hy guys i wanna ask if the investment that i made are good, i have 23 years old and i started in march 2022 to invest and if you have some tips to give :) thanks ☺️","First of all, I only gave an example for an all ETF portfolio.I disagree on avoiding KXI, I mean sure ER is high, but this ETF is about as safe as it gets. Also, you said it yourself: mostly US, but where are the global behemoth Unilever? Where's Nestle? Diageo? They're in KXI.VIG is an absolute beast, high quality holdings. Take a quick look at its holdings and you'll see what I'm talking about.VUG is plain growth, and 10% allocated to growth at a young age is very risk averse if you ask me. Unless we enter a depression or a dystopian world, I find it hard to believe that in 20 years VUG won't be substantially higher than where it is today.But, I'm not a financial advisor after all.",2,0.555,POSITIVE,0.921

It’s basically half the market. And yes you could go half VUG and half VTV and you’ll essentially have the whole market, but it’s kind of pointless. I also don’t think VIG is bad or anything but you can get significantly better exposure to value and quality with an Avantis or DFA fund. It’s ok though.KXI on the other hand, should be avoided. I don’t dislike the big multinational companies you listed in terms of stability or return potential, but 40% of KXI is international. The 60% that is US can be accessed easily in a number of funds for a 0.10 ER. So approximately 0.06 of the 0.40 ER is for the US exposure and 0.34 is for the international exposure. 0.06/0.60 is an effective 0.10 ER for US exposure and 0.34/0.40 is an effective 0.85 ER for International exposure. That is an extremely high price to pay for whatever difference those companies result in compared to US and in your overall portfolio example, you have some exposure to them in VT already. It just doesn’t make sense.For the record, I wish there was a good cheap international consumer staples ETF. There just isn’t one and while KXI is the best thing available, it is simply not justifiable to hold in my opinion as you’d have to fully expect international consumer staples to beat US consumer staples by 0.75% per year forever to justify holding KXI.",3,0.525,NEGATIVE,1.0

,"Hy guys i wanna ask if the investment that i made are good, i have 23 years old and i started in march 2022 to invest and if you have some tips to give :) thanks ☺️","I think your stock choices are not all that bad honestly, if your intention is to hold them forever, however I do agree with others that this isn’t the best way to go about investing as a young person new to all this. In fact, I don’t think it’s the best way for almost anyone to go about investing.The simple thing to do which is highly highly effective is to invest in the broad market with low cost etfs or mutual funds unless or until you feel like you are an expert investor. The broad market represents the aggregate estimated long term value of all stocks by expert investors. Ask yourself what you know about McDonalds that expert investors and the market as a whole doesn’t know or what information or insight you have which the market also has but refuses to act on?If you don’t have a very good answer to that, you should not be investing in individual stocks at all. If you want to become an expert, there are a lot of books you can read about investing generally. You can research factor investing and value investing etc. But until you have done enough research to consider yourself an expert that can confidently discuss your investing philosophy, stay in broad market funds. Something like the SP500, the total US Stock Market, or the total world stock market.",0,0.549,NEGATIVE,0.997
