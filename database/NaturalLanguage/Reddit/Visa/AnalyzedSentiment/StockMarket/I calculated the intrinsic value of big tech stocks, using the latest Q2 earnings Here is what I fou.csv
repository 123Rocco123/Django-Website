However, I'm a bit confused as to the rationale behind applying an 18x terminal multiple for every company.If we look at INTC for example, your projected CF's are growing at ~12% annually but you're applying an 18x terminal multiple. What's the reason behind the higher expected growth/multiple expansion in terminal?Just something to think about as you're building out these models!",0,0.557,POSITIVE,0.508

A terminal multiple of 18 does not mean that the company is expected to grow at 18%. It is about the price tag that investors are willing to put on said stock in 2030. For example, Facebook today trades at 43 multiples of its free cash flow, meaning that investors today have so much fate in the future of facebook stock that are willing to pay 43 times the amount of cash that Facebook earns in a year. In order to be as down to earth as possible, I have assumed that in 2030 Investors will be much less excited about Facebook stock than they are today, so that they will be willing to price it at only 18 multiples of the free cash flow. So you can say that I have taken into account a ""bad"" future scenario for the stocks, so that if the model tells me that Facebook is a buy even in this ""bad"" scenario, I can be even more confident that it will be a good investment for me.In my opinion, the way to play the game is to always consider what can go wrong and what is the bad scenario. If you like the stock even if things play out ""badly"", there you have a fantastic investment.",1,0.561,NEGATIVE,0.994

You're right in the sense that a multiple is a price tag that investors are willing to pay. Therefore, a company trading at premium multiples entails that investors are more excited about it. That said, a multiple IS a direct measure of growth - reflecting the average growth of the underlying metric. The multiples for certain industries are much higher than others because investors assume that the underlying growth profile of that particular business/industry is expected to be higher than a company in a mature industry. To your point, multiple compression occurs as growth prospects for said companies diminish (hence why investors may not be as excited about it), but that's totally okay because companies and industries mature over time. Anyways, always happy to discuss this topic even more. Cheers.",2,0.58,NEGATIVE,0.636
