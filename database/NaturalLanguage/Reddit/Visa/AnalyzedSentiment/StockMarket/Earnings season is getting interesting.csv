,"The market continues to warm up with more very interesting reports in the US market that are about to be published during the day. Visa The company is, without a doubt, one of the most powerful and well-known financial institution in the world, the word ""visa"" become a nickname for a credit card which is obviously one of the known signs of a strong brand. Despite a 17% decline due to COVID-19, there was $1.6 billion in capital returns to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Visa is a must-have asset in any portfolio thanks to its size (assets, capital employees) and of course due to the fact that the world becomes more and more digital and dramatically lowers the use of cash by creating and monitoring cash use restrictions. The report will be published after the US market closes its trading session. Revenue in 2019: $9.7 billion Q3 Revenue Forecast: $5 billion Mastercard Another financial giant will publish its quarterly earnings report during the day. Mastercard posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings but noted a sharp decline in transaction volumes as consumer spending collapsed during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic. “Our platform uniquely positions us to support the shift to digital across consumer and business payments that has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, including an increase in consumers’ preference for contactless payments,” said CEO Ajay Banga. Everyone in the financial sector and especially the credit companies understand the situation but the question is who will do it in the best and safest way for its customers. The company will host a conference call today at 9:00 AM ET, 2020, to discuss Q3 20 earnings results. Revenue in 2019: $7.7 billion Q3 Revenue Forecast: $3.96 billion Boeing Boeing is among the largest global aerospace manufacturers; it is the second-largest defense contractor in the world based on 2018 revenue and is the largest exporter in the United States by dollar value. In 2019, the company recorded $ 76.6 billion in sales and ranked 40th on the Fortune magazine ""Fortune 500"" list, in 2020 the company ranked 121th. 2019 production output list: 380 commercial aircraft 229 military aircraft 2 satellites Apart from the company's great influence on the US GDP, the company has strategic importance to the US government and military and it is impossible to even think of a scenario where the company is in difficulties and the US government does not send some money immediately meaning, the company is considered too big to fall. Revenue in 2019: $76.5 billion Q3 Revenue Forecast: $14.4 billion eBay Not many know this that on October 3, 2002, PayPal became a wholly-owned subsidiary of eBay, only 12 years later, in September 2014, eBay Inc. announced the divestiture of PayPal as an independent company, which was completed in July 2015. eBay generates revenue by a complex system of fees for services, listing product features, and a final value fee for sales proceeds by sellers. eBay is also one of those few companies that benefit from COVID when consumers prefer ro buy online instead of going to a physical store (when they can...) and this can be clearly seen in their revenue and profits in recent months. Revenue in 2019: $10.8 billion Q3 Revenue Forecast: $2.69 billion Ford The company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand, and most luxury cars under the Lincoln brand. Ford also owns Brazilian SUV manufacturer Troller, an 8% stake in Aston Martin of the United Kingdom, and a 32% stake in Jiangling Motors. The headquarters of the company is in Dearborn, Michigan, a Democratic country in six consecutive presidential elections from 1992 through 2012. Donald Trump narrowly flipped the state in 2016, defeating Hillary Clinton by just 0.2%. This was the closest state by popular vote percentage in 2016. why it's important? The company receives a lot of money from the US government so they can pay salaries, in fact, the company did not fire employees in the first six months from the outbreak of the pandemic and paid its employees (who stayed at home) full salaries! Trump wants to win the election again and he knows that Michigan is a very important state when with 16 electors that can keep him in the white house for another 4 years. Revenue in 2019: $156 billion Q3 Revenue Forecast: $35.4 billion","Ford is my second largest holding in my portfolio, behind Swiss bank UBS. I've designated UBS as my dividend farm. (i.e. buy enough shares to where the quarterly dividend is enough to DRIP a new share every quarter) I have taken share price appreciation into account, so I will buy more shares every month or so, to stay ahead.",0,0.554,POSITIVE,1.0
