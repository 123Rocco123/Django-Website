You also have to show how much risk or volatility each portfolio has so I would include either std, sharpe, or preferably sortino in your results.For those who are new or unfamiliar with this concept, basically you want to maximize your return per unit of risk. So option_A may give you higher returns but with more risk and option_B may give you slightly smaller returns but with a lot lower risk. You could (in theory) use leverage (margin, options, futures, etc.) to scale up option_B to give you higher returns than option_A but with the same level of risk.One other thing related to this, there is an interesting fund called Gotham Index Plus where they do something similar. If I remember correctly though they give you the SP500 exposure at 100% but also short the most overvalued stocks based on some metric.
