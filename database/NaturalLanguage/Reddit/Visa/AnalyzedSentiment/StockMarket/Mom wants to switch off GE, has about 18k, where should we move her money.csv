Had I not sold the GE, the money would be staying there, doing nothing. Sure GE stock may bounce up, but the time of waiting and holding will cost more opportunities in the market.

Thanks again!","First of all, forget about the ""20k per stock"" rule. There's nothing to that idea - what you care about is percentage returns not absolute dollar values. Relatedly, ignore any comments naming one or two individual companies.Both for the same reason - the main thing you want is diversification. $18k is a lot of eggs, there's no need putting them all in one basket. Additionally, with apologies, it doesn't sound like your knowledge of the market is enough that you should be picking individual stocks (for reference, I feel that way about myself as well - as well as most people who aren't full time market researchers, really).What you want is a diversified either mutual fund or exchange-traded fund. I would probably buy a fund which tracks market indexes (for example, Schwab's SWPPX or SCHD, but there are many) or a high yield bond fund (a few of the better ones are PRHYX [only available through a Schwab account unless you hit the lottery], PONDX, LHYAX). Stay away from ""sector"" funds - it's safer than an individual stock but not sufficiently diversified. Edit: Look for ""no load"" [transaction fee] funds with lower ""net expense ratio""s (which my suggestions all are) - other funds will take too much of your money in fees. Again, I recommend considering a Schwab account because they have a huge list of funds they offer ""no load"" - many of which DO have a transaction fee if bought elsewhere.Finally, though, this investment broker is right. Talk her out of this if you can. She'll be taking a huge loss right now on a company which is (a) undervalued even now [market always overreacts to bad news] and (b) very likely to recover.",0,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0

I would stay away from mutual funds because they steal a significant portion of your returns away in fees and they rarely perform better than a diversified portfolio of individual stocks. Being that the OP is not knowledgeable about investing, I would stick to large internally diversified companies like BRK.B or GOOGL (as opposed to excellent large companies like Boeing that are in single industries so not ""diverse"", or the many smaller companies recommended elsewhere in this thread).",1,0.521,NEGATIVE,1.0

GE as a brand has fallen off dramatically.. sure it has profitable parts but would your money be better invested elsewhere? I would say yes .. even if GE bounces back.Disclosure (sold my GE position a few years ago),1,0.537,NEGATIVE,1.0

Thanks again!","First thanks for not downvote me. Second I want share with you that Selling something because money can be deployed else where is not a good strategy. There are many good turnaround cases to consider. McDonald’s, Apple, GM, citi, Burger King, etc. the key question to ask is whether GE has lost its fundamentals. In this case no. GE is built on innovation. Can they still innovate? I think the answer is yes.Rule one is not to lose money. This is not an option, future, or leveraged buy case. No need to sell 10 cents on the dollar. Also, the worst time to sell is now because many people will want to exit simply because “it is not the best stock to hold”MR. market is always pessimistic for a beat down stock. In these cases best strategy is to assess whether there truly is a better option worth giving up the turnaround opportunity? My answer is no consider today’s over priced market with 5 rate hikes scheduled.I remember people say - America is changing and McDonald is done. Sell now. If you have bought it then, you would have made 10 folds by now. That was 2004 when healthy food bar was the craze. Can you imagine ditch McDonald and brought one of those health food bar company? What you would have missed.I also remember people say bank like Citi are next during the financial crisis. I remember buying it at slightly under a dollar. if you didn’t listen and brought them like I did, that is another 76 fold investment.There are many such cases, core question is whether it will really go bust. For GE, it is a no. Why, because they still have one of the best science team. So hold tight and don’t rush to invest simply because there is a star in the market especially if means losing money to sell.Today’s Star maybe just a fad, remember my healthy food bar example.Hope this clarify why I think it is best to hold now.Best Roy",2,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.999

From a technical standpoint you are seeing resistance trends continually broken and your money being lost. If you strongly believe in the fundamentals you shouldn't stop watching the company but keep an eye on it until the direction of the market reverses. Sure this means you don't get the initial bounce back but you don't lose all the way down until GE potentially closes its doors.Your mcdonalds question reminds me of coke. One of warren buffets favorite stocks. But America is changing as it always is. Sugar loaded soft drinks started to lose popularity in the US. It's still a successful company and it has it's own water brand now etc. but I never bought it. Over the last five years coke has risen 20% which is fine.. but poor compared to the investments you could have made elsewhere. The Dow Jones itself is up 80%.GE has fallen 50% over the last year.. you definitely have already waited too long GE isn't anywhere close to its peers in the market there is no point in owning GE until it can meet it's performance goals which it hasn't. It's even cut it's dividend now.. something it hasn't done since the great depression. You have some serious rose tinted glasses my friend.. you would be better off selling and putting your money into Honeywell (HON), 3M (MMM), or United Technologies (UTX).Never let your pride interfere with your decisions in the marketplace.",3,0.535,NEGATIVE,1.0

Question I would ask before selling anything are 1. Is investing in something else at this market worth it for a non recourse lost of capital? 2. What are the major forces preventing it from a complete turnaround? 3. How good am I at picking a definitive winner?My advice for most people is to invest in BRK... and forget about it. Yet, if you are a fund manager, please ignore what they taught you about quantitive risk management, technical analysis, or any academic thesis based on efficient market. It is most misleading stuff you can ever get your hands on.Invest like you run the business. Think like an owner. Price is what you paid and value is what you get.Peter Lynch said it best, most people cut flowers and water weeds. Why, there are always better investment opportunities but looking back on actual track records, ones who allocate capital based on value and growth will always outperform momentum chaser.On Coke, you have to look at the downside during investment period. Risk is not volatility as claimed by many... risk is the likelihood of default or price goes to zero. Coke is one of those stock that you know it has very low risk because of its diverse portfolio and strong cash flow. SP 500 is much more correlated with market conditions and can delist many during crisis.Another way to think about this, People will still drink coke products if market close for a year or two. What would happen to SP 500 if market shuts for a year or two?:)",4,0.549,NEGATIVE,1.0

I was only point out why you shouldn’t compare coke to SP 500 because they have different downsides. It is always easy to spot highly valued investment with high premiums at present. They are favored for a good reason. Just like AOL and Yahoo in 2000. Great growth with excellent earning prospects printed out on billboards. So don’t rush to judge a stock because others are buying or trashing. I think it is always wise to ask what is missing and whether it is a good decision to forgo the current opportunity to switch to a highly valued choice at present. Invest wisely. These are lessons that I learned after 20 years in investment. I hope it can also help you to become a better investor.,6,0.527,POSITIVE,0.999
