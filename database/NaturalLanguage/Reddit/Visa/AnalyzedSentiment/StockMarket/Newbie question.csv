,"I want to invest in the encrypted bank linking service Plaid, but can’t find it anywhere on any trading platform (RH, Stash, Public). So I did a google search which led me to find out they were acquired by Visa. Does this mean I should invest some cash in Visa as I believe Plaid is a solid, highly utilized by thousands of apps company. I feel like I have some “well yeah I guess so” and “duh” comments coming my way for this what some people may deem a shit post. Go easy please.",You have to first determine what effect you think the acquisition will have on Visa. My guess is little to none for the foreseeable future. Visa is a huge company and a newish service with little activity is unlikely to make a dent in the short to medium term.,0,0.553,NEGATIVE,0.999

Go easy please.","I am pretty sure they acquired it for $9 billion - for some reason that number is ringing a bell but don't quote me. The point is like someone else said, see how big of an impact it could have. A $9 billion acquisition is massive for a $10 billion company, but tiny for a $1 trillion company. It's all about perspective. also it's a lot tougher with private acquisitions since you don't have public reports like you do w/ a public company. You may want to dig into Visa's filings right after they acquired it to see what they're saying about it as there may be more info on what they see as its future potential in there. In particular I'd look at the 10-Q and 10-K surrounding the acquisition.",0,0.569,POSITIVE,0.564
