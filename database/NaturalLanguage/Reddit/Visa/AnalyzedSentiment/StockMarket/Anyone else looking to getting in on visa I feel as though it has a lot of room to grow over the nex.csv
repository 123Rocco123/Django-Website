,,Like bitcoin? ðŸ˜‚,2,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999
,,"Not just Bitcoin, but other things like Apple pay, alipay, WeChat pay, PayPal, etc.Visa and Mastercard are failing to wedge themselves into those services/products, and there are big reasons for customers and merchants alike to use those services over credit cards.

,,I had a full position in V but I dropped it a couple of months ago. I'm not sure what it is. Maybe hedge funds are using V as a substitute for a general play on economic good or bad news. But over the past several months Visa has been extremely volatile. If the market is down 1% V is usually down 2-3%. Mastercard has been behaving itself much better and is up far more ytd so I have stuck with it.,0,0.538,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,Visa or MSFT is my next buy. I think for 2019 Iâ€™ll set a modest goal of 15 shares of each but if I can swing it Iâ€™m hoping for 20 shares each long and let the dividends DRIP,0,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.998
