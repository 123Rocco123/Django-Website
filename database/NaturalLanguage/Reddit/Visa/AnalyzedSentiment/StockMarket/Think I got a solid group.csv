,Think this can be a solid group,"Pelosi has been dumping V, it is overvalued and should no longer perpetually trade at high multiples.There's competition coming in the form of things like the Discover merger and regulation, changes to fees etc.https://www.durbin.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/The%20Credit%20Card%20Competition%20Act%20of%202023%20-%20one-pager.pdfWMT, big retailers, just about anyone that has to pay obscene fees for the MC/Visa duopoly are not happy.They sit around parasitically with no innovation and keep printing massive amounts of cash.",2,0.505,NEGATIVE,1.0
,Think this can be a solid group,Visa/MC are genuinely businesses that shouldn't exist. Card networks should be jointly owned by card issuers and not operate for a profit.,3,0.523,NEGATIVE,1.0

,Think this can be a solid group,"Pelosi pretty famously bought calls on NVDA shortly before it popped. As a lawmaker she (legally) has insider information and can push for laws and policies that influence the market. It‚Äôs kind of a running joke on WSB that Pelosi‚Äôs plays are GOAT level, so buy/sell whatever she buys/sells",4,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.99
,Think this can be a solid group,"It's not Pelosi for stock ""advice"".Visa is entirely dependent on the actions of Congress to maintain its moat.As another commenter mentioned, the business shouldn't even exist as a single profit entity.",4,0.548,NEGATIVE,1.0
,Think this can be a solid group,OP is investing $40.honestly a waste of time to try to pick stocks with that amount. Just buy s&p500 until you have over 100k.,2,0.538,NEGATIVE,1.0
,Think this can be a solid group,"This is a pretty dumb take tbh, and it‚Äôs basically the opposite of what financial advisers recommend. High risk high reward plays are much safer when you have a small base and a long time frame, and low risk index funds are better when you have a decent arsenal but a smaller time horizon. Either way, with exponential growth it‚Äôs all about rate of change. If you start at 20k and 10x over 4 years (e.g. all in on NVDA IN 2020) you‚Äôll have more money than starting with 100k at 10% growth (e.g. SPY) over the same time frame",3,0.526,NEGATIVE,1.0

,Think this can be a solid group,"As an organization their structure is very disjointed compared to their competition. Different offices and regions lack coherence of approach and resources, Individual agents has less best practices to adhere to than some of their competitors, which gives them agility perhaps but opens them up to much more risk, and opens their clients up to be poached.their market reach is average, their capabilities in the London marketplace (which is key) isn't special or proprietary in any way. Although to be fair for companies Like Aon and Marsh their structure on how they utilize London puts them at a disadvantage often. For many clients a smaller broker who goes through a London broker is going to get a better result.Like a lot of brokerages their exclusive programs blow up every few years because of poor results, but I just don't think the company has the weight and clout to do anything special in the program space.They are arguably the top choice for a Tier 2 brokerage, but they lack a lot of resources and specialty groups, and professionals that the Tier 1's have.Also, as now on the client side after nearly 2 decades of working at brokerages, they are the most ghetto of brokers I deal with. Today in fact I'm currently not very impressed with them.I think investing in them is a better choice than Willis all day every day. I mean looking at the charts the stock is doing fantastic, and I think they could be a buy-out or merger candidate for sure. As an organization, I think they lack key items to make them a competitor to tier 1 brokerages.just my 2 cents.",2,0.53,NEGATIVE,1.0

,Think this can be a solid group,"clearly not investment advice, and clearly they are doing great financially. repeating myself but I think it's the top buy-out candidate out there. Aon tried to buy Willis and got shut down legally in the UK, and maybe US for 'monopolistic' reasons. Willis is now gutted as a result I'm sure AJG is gaining from that. I don't think Aon will be looking to do another move like that soon since the failed attempt hurt them, but amalgamation is the name of the game in the insurance world,",4,0.53,NEGATIVE,0.998
