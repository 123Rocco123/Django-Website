,,"They’ll be hit like anyone else in an actual recession, probably performing similar to the market as a whole during such a period. It’s very hard for companies to avoid seeing red during a recession, it takes everyone down with them during the most part. They might be in better shape than most banks and credit card companies during such a period simply because of how they operate and how they don’t actually lend credit and instead focus on processing payments. Financials are solid for both companies but they are valued fairly high at the moment.Long term, I think they’re solid bets and society is only moving more and more towards being cashless. MasterCard has a lot of room for international growth if they want it while Visa has incredible worldwide exposure and it’s hands in a lot of markets. I’m not sure you’ll see major returns with either company over the next ten years simply because of their current valuation but I wouldn’t be shocked if they match or modestly outperform the market in that time frame.",0,0.538,NEGATIVE,0.86
,,"I was looking at how on average, using 100 year data, financial perform well under the S&P500. However, the industry that V and MA are in might be different.I've had my eye on V for a while, i suspect it might be overvalued right now.I need to read more on how they make money, they might not be as hit hard by a recession as, say Nike.Visa and such are middle men. They make money from facilitating transactions...So i guess in a recession, when everybody just has less money to spend in general, they'd be hit just as hard banks and everything else makes sales mostly from the general public.",1,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.996
,,"I think they’ll be more affected by perception than performance. They shine as payment processors so they should grow as tech spreads globally and so does access.The perception will be that they suck though and will do horribly, so they’ll sell off probably if there’s a recession of any kind.They shine where a lot of other modern US companies shine, which is in using technological advantages to grow globally. If you think about it, it used to be a thing for Westerners to use, then spread out. Unless they’re horribly managed they should have good growth ahead.I don’t own any shares though lol.",0,0.52,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"Hmmm maybe i should stay out of explicit finance. In the long term, they underperform the S&P, and i think there are more unsystematic risk that affects them",1,0.52,NEGATIVE,1.0

,,"Blockchain is changing the world. Just like the internet changed the world blockchain will too. I’m not referring to bitcoin, I’m referring to the technology it’s built on.When email first came out 20 odd years ago people couldn’t believe it “wow I can write a letter and send it to the other side of the world in a few minutes??” It was so unimaginable. Now it’s the norm.Blockchain will replace and improve the way the world works. We are in the early adopter stage. By 2030 it will be everywhere.",2,0.522,NEGATIVE,0.55
,,And how does that affect Visa?,3,0.497,NEGATIVE,0.934
,,"Visa can process around 50,000 transactions a second. There is a blockchain tech called High Performance Blockchain that can process 1million tps. (still in prototype) No I am not invested in HPB. I just know of it, they are aiming to become like an architect layer where the likes of ""Bitcoin"" or similar related cryptocurrencies can be implemented ontop of the HPB Blockchain. Thats just one threat to Visa I can think of at this stage without trawling the internet.",4,0.517,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,Now that’s interesting and worth looking into.No offense but whatever you said earlier just seemed like typical nonsense that blockchain believers spout off when they don’t know what they’re talking about.I like the blockchain tech as well and think big companies like V & IBM will utilize it well in the next few years.,5,0.551,POSITIVE,0.764
,,"Yeah late 2017 IBM partnered with Stellar Lumens (cryptocurrency) and from what I read the other day they are actually using the Stellar network. They can send huge amounts of money in seconds that costs less than a cent. Visa doesnt do that, nor does Paypal as they rape us on fees.",6,0.513,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"2030 seems optimistic for ironing out the last issues. Blockchain is a not threat as governance and liability/responsability is required by regulators. Look at pilotless planes for example: technology is ready already for a decade, yet still a pilot is needed due to the need for the airline to take final responsability in case of an accident.",3,0.514,POSITIVE,0.967
