,"I’d certainly be interested to know your thoughts on these two companies, and a recommendation of which (or neither/both) to invest in at this point. Thanks in advance!","I'm not a believe in cryptocurrencies, although it is appealing, but a company trying to blame cryptocurrencies for their decline is a company in trouble. So, yes, I'd go with Visa. That, and I use Visa. It's not a bad company. Not the best though.",1,0.63,NEGATIVE,0.995

Have you read any of the whitepapers? Your thinking of the term they use as ""shit coins"" which yes are hype coins. Which this is why more regulation will bring cryptocurrency to new heights. Cryptocurrencies are valued based on market cap multiplied by circulating supply. The technology behind crypto is far superior than any bank could offer without currency blockchain.",2,0.544,POSITIVE,0.509

Thanks in advance!","I travel around Europe a lot with work and Netherlands is certainly an anomaly when it comes to debit cards. There everyone uses Maestro and many shops don't accept amex, mastercard or even visa. I don't think any other country in Europe has a problem with visa.

,"I’d certainly be interested to know your thoughts on these two companies, and a recommendation of which (or neither/both) to invest in at this point. Thanks in advance!","I'm writing a research report for my class comparing V, MA and American Exp so if you would like i can post it.I'm researching Visa, and haven't done comparisons with MA yet, but from what I have seen Visa seems to be pretty good, their Visa Europe acquisition was important to help them grow, and the macro factors seem to be in favour of Visa.Visa's revenue is tied to nominal prices, so as nominal prices go up, so does Visa's revenue. Consumer confidence has been trending upward YoY and people have more disposable income YoY. Gas prices have increases too. These are just some small things i've looked at because the credit card (and debit card) can be used to fill up your car, to buy those big purchases of groceries at once. They've been increasing their number of transactions at a steady rate and their EBITDA Margin has been moving up, although its stagnated for the past two or so years - which I believe is due to the Visa Europe Acquisition - still have to look into it more.This is all off from what I remember so it may or may not be right, but lemme know and ill share the whole thing with ya!",0,0.524,POSITIVE,0.85
