Altria = people are not abandoning cigaretes not even in bad times = recession resistant company) and so on... they should pay growing dividends, longer the better, some companies are growing it for 10 years, some for 20, some for 60 years... search for term dividend aristocrats, this is the start... remember, most matured and great companies pay something around 3 % dividends, but it will grow, dont follow 10 % plus in normal times, usually unsustainable or ""more riskyÅ¯ REITs(they are not bad, but they have different risks)... you want long term ? go with this strategy... at least thats what i have been doing",0,0.538,NEGATIVE,0.939

Dividend companies, for example from dividend aristocrat list are laso easier to analyse, they are just much more simple and easier businesses... but listen to me, now, i am only 20 years old, university student form Europe, working so i can buy shares now, studying so i can buy more shares in the future... i am in this market only for half a year... i am not even panicking now, i am just hoping it will be longer, so i can buy more for better price... it is a totally different story if we look at father, who has 3 childrens and is 50 years old... but using some calculations, with this strategy, you can retire in 15 years if you save 50 % of your income and invest it... now will be the great time to do so, because it those companies go bankrupt, we wont need money anymore, because America will collapse and the whiole world with it",2,0.538,POSITIVE,0.836

I also wanted something safer, and because Lynx is basically subsidiary of Interactive Brokers, you have insurance of 20 000 000 USD per account... there is also Degiro, but i somehow dont trust them(but it might be only my personals block)Great companies, but i have one advice for you... do your own research, search through forums, search subreddits, search blogs... then, if you find company you like, learn about metrics like P/E, P/B, P/S, learn to navigate in financial statements... I am interest in that topic for a year, it just came, i was reading everything i could, and recently, i got a part time job as stock analyst... it was like week ago, i wanted to do it, and because i want it to have my career in this field, it is pushing me to learn more... mid summer i invested in MO, XOM, ABBV, T and IRM... and i can easily say, that at that time, it was more about opinions of others... i didnt choose them because i knew them from top to bottom... know, before i invest, i do everything i know...Learn about company from their site(what they do, products and so on)Look at Annual report and find numbers like revenue, Operating income, net incoma, assets, LT debt and some anomalies(there might be big jump in number, for example in debt = find why, use ctrl F in annual report and find why they took it for example because of some acquisition)look at metrics and compare them with industry average P/E, P/B, P/S how much debt they took, you can compare by dividend yield(company average for 5 year vs current)look at dividend - how big, how much it is growing, how long... best site for that is seekingalpha.comAfter that, i choose if i like them or not, i will learn new things in future, now that is all i know... and even now, i would say that i do more things than half of investing subreddit who are full of people asking ""what to buy?""Important thing, choose a path and go that way, dont change the course for some time... you can go the growth way, dividends, value, trading - day or swinging, commodities and much more... but if you think about it, if you choose one and hold onto it, you will gain much more insight and you will be much better in this field - if you jump from one to another, you will have bigger fees, you will probably sell a lot of times for wrong price... I am young and parents are basically paying my university acommodation, food, and basic stuff, i dont have to work, but i do, because i want to invest, for me, for my family in the future, i am investing money for my mother...
