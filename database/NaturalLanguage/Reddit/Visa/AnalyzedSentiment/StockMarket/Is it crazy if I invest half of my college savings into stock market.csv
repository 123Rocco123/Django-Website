,"Hello everyone, I'm a freshman business student and a novice in the stock market and investing. I've had some experience with Cryptos, like Bitcoin, but I believe they're too risky and volatile for this particular purpose. So, I'm considering the stock market, but I have no previous knowledge or experience. Do you think it's safe to put a part of my college savings into the stock market these days? If so, what shares do you suggest? (I don't want to day trade, because I want to spend most of my time on studying and college. I'd rather have a long-term investment.) P.S. I'm an F-1 international student, and I'm not completely sure if I'm legally allowed to invest in the US stock market under my Visa status. I'll need to consult a lawyer before doing anything. If you know anything about this too, please let me know. Thank you EDIT 3: Thank you everyone for your answers. Considering everything, I changed mind and I won't be putting too much money into this. I may invest less than 2K only to gain experience or maybe I use some stock market simulator instead. Thanks guys","How much money are we dealing with? I hate posts on here that are like “Thinking I might be over-leveraged in APPL at 40% of my portfolio” and their portfolio is like $300.You just need to do more research on what kind of investment you want this to be before you start buying stocks that you think are good. Passive, active, risk adverse, etc.But overall the US stock market is an excellent place to invest money LONG TERM(10+ years) and I don’t think you would be crazy putting half of it in there if your situation lines up.",0,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0

SPY would be a safe bet for about 75% of the money he would put in the market, as it is highly traded and should be no problem selling to cash out if money is need within 5 days or so.If he is feeling risky, use that other 25% on some high risk/high reward type stocks. 90/10 split would be more realistic but OP sounds kinda young so could be more risky.",1,0.523,NEGATIVE,0.999

If so, this is a stupid idea and you'd be at risk of losing the lot. The stock market has good annualised returns over the long-term but over the short-term there is a very real risk of losing substantial amounts in %age terms. Don't invest money you need in the next few years. If you don't understand this then you shouldn't be putting money in the markets at all.",0,0.545,NEGATIVE,1.0

,"Hello everyone, I'm a freshman business student and a novice in the stock market and investing.
