,"Over the past 3 months several great companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Visa, etc have taken a nose dive. My idea is to invest in companies with a great growth track record with the belief that they will recover fully from the corona virus hit. The larger a hit a company has taken the larger the recovery gain, which means better return on my investment Apple, Microsoft, and Qualcomm have seen great growth over the past year but QCOM has taken the biggest hit over the past 3 months so it seems reasonable to invest more in that company than the other two with the hopes of greater gain. Of course I will need to research each company to make a more informed decision BTW I am complete noob. Started looking investing a few days ago so I don't miss the great buying opportunity in the coming weeks. Can use all the investing advice for this moment in time","I did that in 2009z. BAC was at $55, giving a nice dividend.12 years later it’s still trying to recover.I gave up waiting after 3 years. Still made a profit, but would have made way more had I waited.What’s the rush? You can’t wait for everyone to get sick around you?",0,0.521,NEGATIVE,1.0

One without much experience would think a well-established bank is obviously going to bounce back. I just looked at its all-time history and it is surprising.

If you think you understand how they make or loose money you are probably wrong.Personally I like companies that make stuff like chips, soda, soap, smartphones, software ... stuff that’s fairly simple to get.I mean look at stuff like waste management or American water operators(water pipes). Energy, beer and internet are great too.Investing in things you don’t understand is just gambling.",2,0.514,NEGATIVE,1.0

Since that bank fiasco I changed tactics and really looked into a company with a microscope.

In this market i do something very unusual for me, I run a combo of low risk and extreme high risk with nothing in between. I bet against the market after these one day rallies we have once a week with highly leveraged knock out products and then invest 80% of the gains in companies with solid Cashflow. The other 20% go back into betting against the market.It’s crazy. But so far it works. I’m up 20% on my portfolio from January, at an ATH for me. And I was heavy in oil stocks that I still hold. I feel lightheaded most of the time though atm ... extremely stressing.",4,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.983

Especially during an upcoming recession/depression.So no, you shouldn't invest more into QCOM. AAPL and MSFT have way better financials and are steadier.",0,0.533,NEGATIVE,1.0
