,"I put together my own mid - long term CFD plan. I chose these stocks on July 25th and put them on a watchlist: Disney, Visa, Broadcom, Nvidia, Vanguard S&P 500, Berkshire Hathaway, USA 500, USA Tech 500, Since July 25th the group has increased by an average of 8.7% If I was to split an investment of £2000 over trading212 would this be smart? I am building my savings, but is there any here that anyone would suggest getting into right away as they’re undervalued? (Probably going to have to enter slowly Really at a loose end here, would love advice as I’m confused as to whether to go with a fund like fidelity or just go for a long term strategy myself.","I think you have a solid list of companies here. With a long term time horizon, it is more important the amount of time you are in the market versus timing the market (aka invest as soon as possible is generally better if holding for 10+ years).I like all the individual stocks you have and you could add more mega caps (easiest way to visualize what might be missing is with the heatmap on finviz which shows box by market cap). For the ETFs, they are good but not sure you need USA 500 and VOO. I think fine to add more tech if you want with something like vug. These ETFs are diversified so you only need a few. Good luck",0,0.535,POSITIVE,0.999
