,"So I don't have a whole lot to invest atm but I'm wondering how worth it would be to drop say $100 in a couple diff stocks like apple, Disney, amazon, tesla, netflix, facebook, google, costco, wm, visa, brk.b, etc. Or if I should focus on just putting more in a few of them. I plan on trying to invest atleast $1000 in individual stocks a month moving forward. I did also just drop $500 in MSFT yesterday since they seem to be rising quicker than most lately.","I set up a fractional shares account with M1 finance. MSFT, V, DXCM, DIS. I plan on throwing in about 50 bucks a month and so far I'm up 15.9%. it's not a ton of returns but it beats any rate you'll get from a savings account. Very happy with it so far.",0,0.529,POSITIVE,0.997

Your money has as much chance to grow with a fractional share as a whole share. Makes no difference. However, many of these stocks you mentioned are really overvalued. You are more likely to lose money for the next 10 to 20 years. You need to buy stocks that are a fair value or undervalued based on something outside of business fundamentals.",0,0.548,NEGATIVE,1.0

I'm wondering though if it would be better to focus on investing more $$ in a few or less in multiple, at least to start, and I can always add more to certain ones as time goes on.. I just feel it would be better to get in with some of these that are seeing high growth as of late than to wait it out, i dunno.. I'm still trying to learn as much as I can!",3,0.553,POSITIVE,0.994

Invest for the long haul and you’ll be fine if you bought at the right price. When others are fearful. That’s when you buy. Not when everyone is jumping in. Then it’s too late. Wells Fargo, Boeing, SPG, etc. are unpopular due to forces outside the fundamentals and nobody wants in right now. That’s why those are the deals. Once everybody gets back on board, the opportunity is missed. But, you’ve got to be in for the long haul because no one knows when that will be.",4,0.524,NEGATIVE,0.999
