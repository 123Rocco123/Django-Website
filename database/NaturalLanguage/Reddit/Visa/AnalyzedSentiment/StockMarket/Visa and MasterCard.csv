Thoughts on these?,V is my largest single holding but even so it's not quite 5% of my portfolio. I hope to own it for the next 20 years but things that far in the future can be impossible to predict. PYPL is not far behind V in my portfolio weighting. I have a notion that in the longer run it could turn out the bigger winner. So about 8% of my portfolio is electronic payments companies. I think that's about the right place to have it. Hope to own both for a real long time but not going to stake my financial future to any one company or industry. Don't own MA.

Total BS... and I would, as an investor, be a bit concerned that regulation will eventually be sufficient to deal with their nonsense.

,Both stocks have very good past performance with double digit revenue and profit. Both look set to grow with the cashless society looming. Thoughts on these?,"Hey great question! Visa and Mastercard are two of the top 5 holdings in my portfolio. Since 2017 I have a 163% return in MA and 128% return in V. These two are undeniably the leaders in financial technology and the global migration from a cash to digit/card based currency. If you look at the valuations, both are getting a little extended here along with the rest of the market. But if your investment horizon is 5-10 years, I think you buy a little here and safely cost average down in the next market down cycle.I write a pretty in-depth newsletter covering all my positions at mkeinvestmentclub.com, I hope this helps!",0,0.54,POSITIVE,0.999
