Agriculture is a particularly important commodity group for the DMCC, where the Middle East and North Africa (“MENA”) region’s own considerable demand for food imports with its estimated population of 547 million (Source: Worldbank - 2020), has assisted in creating a thriving and fast-growing agricultural commodities market. CEO comments: “The considerable investment Tingo Mobile has made over the years in establishing strong relationships and infrastructure in Africa has allowed it to create a unique and exceptionally strong supply chain. With our Agri-FinTech platforms and products significantly impacting users’ crop yields and increasing the amount of produce available for export, we are now able to empower our members further by offering them direct access to international markets. Through this end-to-end, seed-to-sale model, and our ability to procure billions of dollars of agricultural produce through Nigeria and Ghana, we believe we will become a major global food exporter and completely dollarize our business from next year. It should also be noted that the significant growth in group revenues, which we expect to result from our commodity platform and export business, will in turn contribute to a significant increase in profitability.” Q3 Revs $291.7M Inc $160M https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mict-inc-reports-third-quarter-140000559.html Tingo Merger Complete https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mict-completes-acquisition-operating-business-145200166.html Deck http://www.buyins.com/report/mictdeck11-21-22.pdf Squeeze starts at $2.09 http://www.buyins.com/images2/mictstr2-14-23.JPG",So what can we expect for the future of MICT? new trader here,0,0.592,POSITIVE,0.797
