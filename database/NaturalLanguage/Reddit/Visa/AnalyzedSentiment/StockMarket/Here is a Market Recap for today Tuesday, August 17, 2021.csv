,"PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 17, 2021 Stocks fell firmly on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones retreating from record levels yesterday amid a mixed batch of earnings results from major retailers and new economic data regarding retail sales. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting to hear from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is scheduled to speak later this week. Market participants will be waiting to see if there is any new information regarding a potential taper timeline. Shares of Dow component Walmart (WMT) fell even after the big-box retailer posted second-quarter results that blew past estimates and raised its full-year guidance. Stimulus check spending, strong grocery demand and e-commerce sales helped push U.S. comparable sales excluding gas up by 5.5%, topping estimates but still slowing from last year's 9.9% surge. Home Depot (HD), meanwhile, missed on comparable sales for the second quarter, with these rising 4.5%, way below consensus estimates of a 5.5% increase. According to the Department of Commerce, for the month of July, retail sales in the US fell 1.1%, much higher than the drop of 0.3% expected and below the 0.7% increase in June, a sign that economic activity is slowing down, likely to the surge in the coronavirus delta variant and government stimulus drying up. Consumer spending makes up nearly 70% of US GDP, so market participants closely track these reports. China released economic data for July that showed growth rates slow down dramatically as the world’s second largest economy battles with summer flooding and the resurgence of coronavirus thanks to the highly contagious delta variant. Industrial production, a gauge of activity in the manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors, grew by 6.4% year-over-year in July, a sharp deceleration from the 8.3% rise in June and below the 7.9% growth expected. Retail sales, a key measurement of consumer sentiment in the world’s most populous nation, grew by 8.5% in July, way below the 12.1% increase in June and missing the 11.5% expected by economists. The National Bureau of Statistics noted “the impact of multiple factors including the growing external uncertainties and the domestic COVID-19 epidemic and flooding situation,” according to a release. The bureau added that the “economic recovery is still unstable and uneven.” Looking ahead, market participants are set to receive the Federal Open Market Committee's July meeting minutes (which are basically notes of what was discussed) on Wednesday, offering more context around how much more amenable central bank officials have become to the notion of tapering their crisis-era asset purchases as the economic recovery takes place. As I have said in the past, I wouldn’t be surprised if there is more discussion about a potential timeline to begin tapering quantitative analysis, though I remain unconcerned. While the markets may react negatively, the real test will be in 2022 when discussions of raising the interest rates are brought to the table. Highlights U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen doubled down on her support of President Joe Biden's plans increase investments in physical and human infrastructure in an op-ed published on Yahoo Finance Tuesday.

,"PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 17, 2021 Stocks fell firmly on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones retreating from record levels yesterday amid a mixed batch of earnings results from major retailers and new economic data regarding retail sales. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting to hear from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is scheduled to speak later this week. Market participants will be waiting to see if there is any new information regarding a potential taper timeline. Shares of Dow component Walmart (WMT) fell even after the big-box retailer posted second-quarter results that blew past estimates and raised its full-year guidance. Stimulus check spending, strong grocery demand and e-commerce sales helped push U.S. comparable sales excluding gas up by 5.5%, topping estimates but still slowing from last year's 9.9% surge. Home Depot (HD), meanwhile, missed on comparable sales for the second quarter, with these rising 4.5%, way below consensus estimates of a 5.5% increase. According to the Department of Commerce, for the month of July, retail sales in the US fell 1.1%, much higher than the drop of 0.3% expected and below the 0.7% increase in June, a sign that economic activity is slowing down, likely to the surge in the coronavirus delta variant and government stimulus drying up. Consumer spending makes up nearly 70% of US GDP, so market participants closely track these reports. China released economic data for July that showed growth rates slow down dramatically as the world’s second largest economy battles with summer flooding and the resurgence of coronavirus thanks to the highly contagious delta variant. Industrial production, a gauge of activity in the manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors, grew by 6.4% year-over-year in July, a sharp deceleration from the 8.3% rise in June and below the 7.9% growth expected. Retail sales, a key measurement of consumer sentiment in the world’s most populous nation, grew by 8.5% in July, way below the 12.1% increase in June and missing the 11.5% expected by economists. The National Bureau of Statistics noted “the impact of multiple factors including the growing external uncertainties and the domestic COVID-19 epidemic and flooding situation,” according to a release. The bureau added that the “economic recovery is still unstable and uneven.” Looking ahead, market participants are set to receive the Federal Open Market Committee's July meeting minutes (which are basically notes of what was discussed) on Wednesday, offering more context around how much more amenable central bank officials have become to the notion of tapering their crisis-era asset purchases as the economic recovery takes place. As I have said in the past, I wouldn’t be surprised if there is more discussion about a potential timeline to begin tapering quantitative analysis, though I remain unconcerned. While the markets may react negatively, the real test will be in 2022 when discussions of raising the interest rates are brought to the table.
