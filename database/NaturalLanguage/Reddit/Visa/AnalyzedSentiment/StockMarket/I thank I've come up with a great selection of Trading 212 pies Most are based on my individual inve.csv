,"EV & Auto Tech Pie https://prnt.sc/xcy5px I searched long and hard for a suitable ETF and while a few keep getting mentioned like CRIV and iDRV I couldn't access these on the platforms I use. So I came up with this selection, which ranges from popular EV manufacturers like Tesla and Nio to battery and component stocks. They've performed very well individually and the great thing about this pie is that I can re-adjust the weightings when needed. Currently Tesla and Plug Power are very prominent due to current growth but it won't last forever and then I will be moving more into the component space (e.g. batteries and lithium) 5G, Semiconductors & Microchips Pie https://prnt.sc/xcy8h4 I follow Fool.com who were heavily promoting 5G stocks but I didn't want to pay for the subscription. I did my own research and this is a collection of stocks I have been investing in for around 1 year and they've all seen excellent growth. This is the pie that I'm most confident about long-term. With the exception of AMD and Nvidia Who are fairly well-known, many of these of stocks aren't known very well in terms of the brand names involved but they play a significant role in our lives and I expect will play an even greater role in the years to come. I'll be updating this soon with a couple of additional stocks that I've been tracking. You'll notice a pattern as many of the companies feature across pies, especially in the semiconductor/chip space. The ones below are more speculative based on my research. I don't have as much experience investing in these sectors but I feel they have great potential and would really like to get feedback on these: Hydrogen & Fuel Cell Energy Pie https://prnt.sc/xa4nmv This one is linked to my EV pie but with more of a broader focus on energy solution suppliers working in the Hydrogen space. Uranium Mining & Energy Pie https://prnt.sc/xa4lsr Many of these stocks are near an all time low given uranium/nuclear power's lack of popularity historically, but times are changing and demand for uranium and nuclear is growing so I can only see this going up in the years to come. Crypto, e-Payment Platforms & Blockchain Pie https://prnt.sc/xa4me0 Many of the players here are well know and are getting on board with crypto in a big way, e.g. Visa, PayPal, DocuSign, etc. Others provide the chips and hardware to make bitcoin/crypto mining possible, e.g. AMD and Nvidia.
