,"Hello, I would greatly appreciate any feedback on my portfolio, what you would keep, sell or any adjustment to my capital allocation. I am thinking of easing into a position in TLT (bonds) at less than 130 and IAU (gold) at less than 12.5 as soon as they both drop in price and will gradually increase my position in both around March 2020. I would get into TLT as the price usually go up during a recession and would take a position in IAU instead of GLD as I have more faith in BlackRock rather than HSBC as a custodian of the ETF and I am not looking to get into physical gold as I would have to find a proper way to store the metal. I am also looking to sell Starbucks and get into a position in Luckin Coffee as the price drops below the 22 range. I am thinking of cutting my position in HAE in half and putting the money in a company such as ATRS, which should soon become profitable and has high growth potential and is trading below intrinsic value. For risk aversion tolerance, I am 22 years old and in last year of university, so I am willing to take a little more risk than someone who places money into a retirement fund. Looking forward to what you have to say.

I want to start a dividend portfolio in january and there are several ETF-s i'm trying to choose from. Most of them are european since i am from europe.I have another kind of dilemma because i can't choose wether i should make an Interactive Brokers account or choose a service from my homeland.,2,0.543,NEGATIVE,1.0
