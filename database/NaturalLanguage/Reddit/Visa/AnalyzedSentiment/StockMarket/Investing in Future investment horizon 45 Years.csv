It's his full time job. And Berkshire Hathaway stock is not beating the SPY on a rolling ten year basis.For me to assume that I'll do as well as I did when I was young and had much less money now that I have a full time job and a wife and bills to pay...It's simply not realistic. Most guys who are holding on to a stock that outperforms are holding onto 20 other stocks that are underperforming and 1 or 2 that have performed terribly.Warren Buffet is a pro. Ray Dalio is a pro. They are not using their smartphones and Robinhood and Public WiFi access and reddit to make their investment decisions.If 99% of wall street professionals can't do it then it's a waste of time.Especially when you take into account the emotions. If you are a stone cold samurai trader with balls of steel who can load up on options when you think MKTX is going to pop... Then go ahead and run your nest egg like you're a hedge fund manager.Im smart enough to realize that now at 30, I am not willing to do with $20,000 what I did with $5000 and I'm not willing to do with $100 what I would have done with $1000 back then.If the SP500 drops 30% I can convince my wife that we should buy a fuckton more of SPY much easier than convincing her we should buy more AMZN when AMZN is down 20% after Warren gets elected. Or buying more GOOGL after some European country sues them.I find it easier to take ounces of gold out of my safe and sell them to buy SPY or QQQ after a dip than selling gold to buy TSLA or whatever stock is hot now and probably won't be the hot stock in 20 years. The hottest stock in 20 years, is probably not on your list of stocks. And it will be on the SPY in 20 years.Warren Buffet missed out on the entire tech boom. Now 25% of Berkshire capital is invested in one stock.... Apple. I highly doubt his average return will beat the SPY in the long run.If it did... It would be a hot stock. Google and Amazon and Netflix and Tesla are hot stocks. Not Berkshire.******Edit: the type of behavior that got me to double my net worth in 2012 and 2013 and 2014... led me to a 98% return within the first 3 months of 2012...Would probably wipe my account out when a crash comes along.It's easy to beat the market when I've only been investing for 8 years and my best trades involved lots of leverage and the Fed was printing billions a month.With all of that... Had I invested in a leveraged index ETF like SPXL or TQQQ with regular monthly deposits and a small stash of UST...I would have made even better returns than I made buying dips of AMZN and JPMlook at a portfolio made up of 33% UST and 66% SPXL100% of pros ain't beating that mix.Wall Street makes a killing off of people believing they can beat an index fund... So the game still exists. They get to charge fees on actively managed capitalYou don't get to charge fees. You just end up paying short term capital gains for all your swing trades.Put most of your money in a stock index, the rest in a gold or treasury fund... And rebalance every 3 months. That way you won't be stuck 100% long the riskiest stocks and end up losing 50% of your net worth in 6 weeks.",5,0.538,NEGATIVE,1.0

Professionals, sure, but that was my point, perhaps I didn't make myself clear.Also, on Warren not beating the market, that's not the data I've seen...
