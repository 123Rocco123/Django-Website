,"I live in the UK and Ark's ETF's aren't available to me. So using the free trading platform Trading212 (I invest long term, I don't trade), I've tried to replicate the holdings of Ark's 5 main ETFs: K, W, F, Q and G. But there are about 100 companies over those five ETF's, some of which have less than a 0.10% holding. I've dropped some of those lesser holdings, but I stock pick myself so hold a few stocks that are not in Ark (such a LuLu, Doms Pizza, Visa, Disney etc). So I'm up to 70 holdings (55 Ark,15 my picks), ranging from my top holding that is 8% of my portfolio, to the smaller more speculative holdings of about 0.5%. Sometimes I think my portfolio is well diversified and 70 holdings is fine (some people just have a S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100 tracker), sometimes I think I need to trim it down to about 40 to have it more concentrated, and increase my main holdings (Fangs, SQ, PayPal, Roku, Pins, Meli, and yes Tesla). Opinions please, taking into account that I don't need any money out of my portfolio for at least ten years, so although I'm the opposite of a value investor, I do believe in the Buffett way of buy and hold. I mainly DCA it and have a bit in cash for dips. Sorry for the waffle! Cheers.",You hold 70 stocks? For starters try cutting that in half,0,0.505,NEGATIVE,1.0

Cheers.","ark funds are actively managed so the holdings are changing all the time and there's a bunch of turnover. so you won't be able to replicate what they're actually doing - just replicate the approximate holdings percentage at a given time across all funds overall.if i were you i'd give it a year and compare your ark stock picks performance against the performance of the ark funds and considering their expense ratio whether it makes more sense to invest in the ark funds instead, plus your other stock picks. i'm guessing you'll be better off with ark funds. but who knows.",0,0.549,NEGATIVE,1.0

Cheers.",i see. the best you can do other than buy/holding all the ark picks is to do rebalancing of your entire ark stock 'bucket' according to the holding updates arkinvest publishes. but doing this you'll be behind their actions by 2-4 weeks so it's better probably just to adjust your allocations on your own as you go (e.g. when / how often to sell some of the overperformers and buy some of the shares trading lower),2,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.918

It is what it is, I find them interesting but not enough to put money into them. But buy and hold may not compare to their active management of speculative stocks. They're less risky than imitating their picks since you don't sell high then rebuy lower.",0,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.706
