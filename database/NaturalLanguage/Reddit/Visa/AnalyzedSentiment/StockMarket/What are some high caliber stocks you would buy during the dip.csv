,I’m talking about companies like Microsoft and Visa with fundamentals to back up valuation. Not speculative companies like virgin atlantic.,"Well I disagree with the other two commenters. The Dow is down 3,000 points and interest rates just got cut 1/2%. Now is a great time to buy both stocks and bonds. Look at historical returns for the past 5 years and current valuation and buy accordingly. Anyone holding an abundance of cash or cash equivalents right now is missing opportunities.",0,0.533,POSITIVE,0.698
,I’m talking about companies like Microsoft and Visa with fundamentals to back up valuation. Not speculative companies like virgin atlantic.,"What you just said seems to be the exact reason it isn't the best time to buy from what we know. Fed cut rates are indicating things may be worse, and are to entice people to spend more money, but if people are worried about going out and getting sick, they aren't going to be spending money unless it's online. The DOW dropping could be done now, or keep dropping from the virus or other issues that arise. Of course if you are holding long term, now is a good time to buy since prices will most certainly go up in the future, but that's why you should buy a little now, and keep watching and buying more as prices drop or rise. Never know what the market is going to do.",1,0.542,NEGATIVE,0.991
,I’m talking about companies like Microsoft and Visa with fundamentals to back up valuation. Not speculative companies like virgin atlantic.,"You contradict yourself.Both stocks and bonds, in general, are down. NOW is the time to buy because they are valued lower and we have seen where the market not only can go, but where it wants to be. The coronavirus scare is an irrational panic from which people are already beginning to recover. If this was Obama's economy, I would be nervous. Trump's economy has shown us a solid trend and I for one am cashing in on this sale; stocks and bonds.",2,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.997
,I’m talking about companies like Microsoft and Visa with fundamentals to back up valuation. Not speculative companies like virgin atlantic.,"I just meant to say that we don't know what the market will do, and that was pretty much it. Prices could drop, they could start to rise and recover. I agree that the scare is irrational. Buy for long term and that's fine, but prices could drop and you could possibly pick up more shares and earn more. I must have worded something wrong cause I was agreeing with you for the most part that buying now is a good idea. Just that I personally am buying slowly, some now, and some when I start to feel like they will just continue rising.",3,0.523,NEGATIVE,0.999

,I’m talking about companies like Microsoft and Visa with fundamentals to back up valuation. Not speculative companies like virgin atlantic.,"Not true.

,I’m talking about companies like Microsoft and Visa with fundamentals to back up valuation. Not speculative companies like virgin atlantic.,"Now is a great time to buy. But, is next week a better time to buy? Or next month?I think we can all agree that the cause of the market downturn the last 14 days has less to do with financials and balance sheets, and more to do with the immediate impact of corona virus on those financials.If you believe that to be the cause of the downturn, and you expect that fear is beginning to Go away and reset (or become less of an influence), now is a great time.If you believe that to be the cause of the downturn and you expect fear in the next 2 weeks to increase for whatever reason, and that continues to influence the market, then now is less optimal time to buy.However if you believe the virus was not the cause of the dips, or less of an influence, or the feds numbers are influential enough to overcome it, then use those factors to determine if now or later are a good time to buy.Personally I believe now is a bad time (less optimal). I believe the US Market went down because of fear. And the US hasn’t even really started testing the population yet, so I believe it’ll go down further if a few hundred people catch/die of it.With an unprecedented manufacturing shut down, all retail companies who manufacture in China will eventually run out of inventory. Even if China starts up today, there’s a 2 month gap in inventory before stuff gets on a container ship and another 2 months before that gets in the shelves. Since companies (like Apple) are geniuses at producing just enough product that they don’t float inventory (Tim cooks claim to fame), they will quickly run out of inventory. I believe that will cause everyone to miss their 3rd and maybe 4th quarter earnings.I’m not sure when those potential losses will be worked into the stock price or earnings estimates. Maybe they already are and that was part of the dip. Maybe they won’t be until October and the market will dip hard because OmG oops we forgot no inventory no profits we missed all our targets. That’s right around the chaos of election time too. So maybe the market will go down again then?So when is the best time to buy? Now? Next month? October? I think things set to go down again next month caused my more fear, then have weird patterns of growth the rest of the year.Time in market beats timing the market.",1,0.542,NEGATIVE,0.988
,I’m talking about companies like Microsoft and Visa with fundamentals to back up valuation. Not speculative companies like virgin atlantic.,"The last times the FED made emergency rate cuts definitely were not a great time to buy, quite the reverse actually. And the Dow got set back to levels from about a year ago, if you weren’t desperate to buy then why now?",1,0.558,NEGATIVE,1.0
,I’m talking about companies like Microsoft and Visa with fundamentals to back up valuation. Not speculative companies like virgin atlantic.,"You make some erroneous assumptions. 1) To call this interest rate cut an ""emergency"" is a misnomer. It is actually a panicked, knee-jerk response to another, panicked, knee-jerk response (the coronavirus). Powell is an idiot in my NSH for reacting so fast. The market was already starting to recover. His sction will serve to hurt more than help investors. 2) You assume I wasn't investing a year ago. 3) You assume I am desparate to invest. No, I DCA by buying regularly but I'm smart enough also to recognize a sale when I see one.",2,0.536,NEGATIVE,1.0

,I’m talking about companies like Microsoft and Visa with fundamentals to back up valuation. Not speculative companies like virgin atlantic.,"But DCA is a longer term strategy and even the best at market timing struggle to get it right. Longer term; DCA well perform as well if not outperform. Historical studies prove it.I'm not going to argue with you unless you're giving advice to, or investing for, others.

,I’m talking about companies like Microsoft and Visa with fundamentals to back up valuation. Not speculative companies like virgin atlantic.,"The market is more often driven by ""warm fuzzies"" than actual financial influencers or events. You are correct, this most recent 3,200 point downturn was driven by irrational fear.As per my first point, the recovery will be driven by loss of the fear of the corona virus outbreak and the realization that half the planet isn't going to die.The 800 point downturn after the Fed lowered the interest rate 1/2 point was in part financially driven and fear driven. However, the reason for the interest rate drop was in itself based on fear. I think it was as stupid move, but hey, I'm not Jerome Powell.The good news is thst bonds and stocks are both on sale.Unless you are a wizard of a Wall Street broker, DCA is the best investment strategy. But buying and holding investment instruments that are discounted isn't a bad move, either.Absolutely! Time in the market beats timing in the market.....90% of the time. I think this is going to be that 10% time.",0,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.999
